                        "description": "Gary Jordan (Host): Houston, we have a podcast. Welcome to the official podcast of the NASA Johnson Space Center, Episode 157, \"Gateway.\" I’m Gary Jordan and I’ll be your host today. On this podcast we bring in the experts, scientists, engineers, astronauts, all to let you know what's going on in the world of human spaceflight. We talk about Artemis quite a bit on this podcast. This is NASA's program to return to the Moon sustainably, under a new architecture. One of the key elements of a sustained presence on the Moon is an outpost orbiting around it, called the Gateway. If you're like me, you may be thinking, is this like the International Space Station, but around the Moon instead of Earth? It's actually pretty different. Not just the location, but the orbit is unique, the size, the elements, all framed within a new way of doing business. So here to describe the Gateway, and what it is, and what it has completed thus far, is Dan Hartman and Lara Kearney, Gateway Program Manager and Deputy Program Manager respectively, here at the Johnson Center. They're the ones leading the charge in building this from the ground up. Not just the Gateway, but the program itself. So here we go. The outpost around the Moon, known as Gateway for NASA's Artemis program with Dan Hartman and Lara Kearney. Enjoy.  [ Music]  Host: Dan and Lara, thanks so much for coming on Houston We Have a Podcast today.  Lara Kearney: Good afternoon.  Dan Hartman: Howdy.  Host: Hey guys. So excited to have you both on to talk about Gateway. I think a lot of people are curious on just what this thing is, and how it folds into this grander picture we have called Artemis. But before we begin, I think what's exciting is between the two of you, you have such diverse experiences here at NASA. So, Dan, I'm going to pitch it over to you first. Understanding a little bit about what you've done at NASA, a little bit about your background and who you are as the leader, the manager of this new program we have here. Dan, take it away.  Dan Hartman: Yes, thank you Gary. Appreciate you doing this. It's a great opportunity for Lara and I to describe what we've been up to for the last year and a half. Let's see. I grew up in the St. Louis area, and moved down here actually, in the Clear Lake area, when I was 16 years old. My father got transferred. And so, went to high school in the JSC vicinity, and ended up going to Texas A&M University and received an electrical engineering degree. What was cool about that, up at Texas A&M, is I got to work on a senior project that was actually one of the first remote sensing payloads that flew on the Space Shuttle program. So, we had a kind of professor that was leading the charge. I guess kind of like the [Principal Investigator] PI. And he got a bunch of students together to figure out how to go fly this thing. We started the project off, and then a couple years later, as senior classes came through, they actually flew the device on the shuttle. So that was really cool. Got me really excited into space. And so out of college, I joined McDonnell Douglas for about nine years. I did a lot of work with cargo integration, payload integration in the back of the shuttle. For that duration, and then in 1994 I joined NASA and right on in to the ISS program. And geez, up until about a year and a half ago, I was in the ISS program, I worked my way up to the ISS vehicle manager, the [International Space Station Mission Management Team] IMMT chairman, and eventually the deputy program manager to both Mike Suffredini and Kirk Shireman. And then was given the opportunity to come join the Gateway program. And it's been a fun ride ever since.  Host: [laughs] Well, that's actually going to be part of the story that I want to tell here, is just that ride from when you first became the program manager for Gateway, and just building that program from the ground up. But, Lara first I want to pass it over to you, because your experience is a little bit different, but although your schooling might have been a little the same.  Lara Kearney: Yes, a little bit of the same. Actually, one of the few people that is a native Houstonian. So as a child, I spent a few years in New Orleans. My father was in the oil and gas industry. And so, as a young child I was there. But from the age of ten on, I lived here in Houston on the north side, and kind of funny you know, we would drive often from north Houston to Galveston, and I would pass through this Clear Lake area, and it never even dawned on me I had NASA sitting in my backyard. So, you know, unlike a lot of people at NASA, I was not one of those that said I want to work for NASA and set that path ahead of me. I also went to Texas A&M. I have a bachelor's and master's in biomedical engineering. And I was coming close to the end of my bachelor's degree, and I was seriously considering medical school when NASA showed up on the doorstep to hire biomedical engineers. And it was honestly the first time I thought, wow. Well, that -- I could do that right? And kind of come home to the area I grew up in. And so that's how I landed here. Like Dan, I also started in the contractor community in the health and medical area. I worked for Lockheed for a little while. I worked for Krug Life Sciences for a little while. And then I converted over into a civil servant in 2000. So, I have really -- my background is predominately in hardware development. I worked operations a little while, early on. But it's really been in hardware development the whole time. I worked Shuttle Mir, and then I moved into the EVA world, with spacewalking in 1997. And so, I worked EVA suits from 1997, all the way through 2011. And I was able to kind of ride the Constellation wave there. I was the project manager for the new suit development for Constellation. And when that program was canceled, I moved over to the Orion program in the Crew and Service Module Office. We took the remaining part of the spacesuit from the Constellation program, and we moved it over to Orion. So that's how I kind of moved into the Orion area. But that was the first taste I had of real spacecraft development was over in Orion in the Crew and Service Module. So, it's kind of super. I love working with Dan, because he brings in all the ISS ops experience you know? And I kind of have the deep space development experience, and so I think it's working really well for the two of us.  Host: And that's what I love, is this -- both of you have this diverse experience that kind of adds to this program. So, Lara, I want to lock in on yours for a second. Your experiences. What about your involvement with the deep space programs, and with human health and performance, and all of that, what skills are you contributing to the thoughts of how to operate and build Gateway from the ground up?  Lara Kearney: Well, you know, I -- you know, everything we do in our world, money is very important. Right? Money's a resource, and you have to have funding to be successful. But I learned very quickly in Orion, that when you go into deep space, mass is as critical a commodity as funding actually is. And I think somewhat you know, we got used to operating here in low-Earth orbit, where mass wasn't quite as critical. So, we, Orion, had to kind of re-learn how to get back into deep space. Again mass, and then just risk acceptance. You know, when you're on the space station, obviously there's critical systems there, but we can get a crew home in an hour and a half, or two hours if we have to. When you start taking crews back to the Moon and beyond, these spacecrafts have to be highly reliable, because we can't get them home quite as quickly. And so, I really learned a lot in Orion on how to make mass trades, and how to make risk trades for crew safety, crew survival, things like that.  Host: Very valuable. I'm hearing money, I'm hearing mass, I'm hearing risk acceptance as some of these top considerations that you're thinking of for this new program. Now Dan, passing it over to you, your experiences with International Space Station, with shuttle, that you're bringing to Gateway.  Dan Hartman: Sure. I'll tell you a lot of hardware development. When I was the ISS vehicle office manager, like you know, we had seven or eight elements sitting down at the [Space Station Processing Facility] SSPF in KSC, going through various stages of integration and testing, getting them ready to go launch. And so how they would go assemble on orbit and continue to fly as individual spacecraft after each one of the assemblies. Got a vast experience in that. You really understand anomalies and failures, even when you test on the ground. And that can be directly applicable to you know, how the systems might react in space. And I tell you the other thing I think I bring to the table is geez, probably for the last 20 years, just heavy, deep involvement with everything associated with the international partners. And it's so good to be able to carry that from ISS over into the Gateway program. Quite honestly, that's one of the main attractions that I had to come over and take the job. You know, working with the -- Europe, ESA, the Japanese, the Canadians, and a little bit right now with the Russians. You know, I'll tell you that actually the program mangers that are on the Gateway also have very identical heritage in the ISS program. And so, they're bringing all that experience into this as well. So, we really hit it off. We've got a great working relationship with the international partners. We're very close to signing the official, formal [Memorandum of Understanding] MOUs that kind of sets in concrete the contributions and benefits that we'll be able to provide to all the international partners. And as you know, it's what the international partners are primarily interested, is career opportunities, right? So, their contributions on Gateway will lead to direct flights to the Gateway, eventually, of those international astronauts. So, it's just a -- it's just one of the bright spots of taking on this job. And being able to apply what we've learned on ISS directly onto the Gateway program.  Host: This is fantastic. And I want to take that opportunity to lead into setting up just what this thing is. We've described kind of some of the thoughts and considerations and skills going in to building it. Lara, I'll pass it over to you, from a very high level, what is Gateway?  Lara Kearney: Well, you know -- we are going to be -- we call it an orbiting platform around the Moon. We try to stay away from terms like \"space station,\" because there are going to be some fundamental differences between the Gateway and the space station. We are not nearly as big as the International Space Station, nor are we inhabited 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. So, we have some fundamental differences, but we're basically going to be a habitation outpost around the Moon, and we are there to provide services. A place for landers to aggregate, a place for Orion to bring the crew to, so that we have a sustained, permanent presence around the Moon, and we can support the lunar landing missions.  Host: OK. So, we have an idea of kind of what it is, imagining a smaller space station, not quite the same, I guess elements of a space station. Maybe a little bit smaller, definitely further away. So, Dan, where is this orbiting platform around the Moon? We're saying, \"around the Moon,\" but where?  Dan Hartman: Sure. We're -- in fact in late 2023, we're on track to go launch our first, actually two integrated elements, the [Power and Propulsion Element] PPE and the HALO, into what we call near rectilinear HALO orbit. And that's basically an orbit around the Moon, that's I'll say a halo shape. Kind of gets within about 1,000 miles of the Moon surface, and then kind of spirals out to about to about 40,000 miles away. And it's a very, very stable orbit. Which really means we use less propellants, less attitude control to maintain how we fly. It's a good explorer [inaudible]. It's a good staging point for the Orion spacecraft to come. The lunar landers can aggregate at the Gateway, go down, conduct their sorting missions, and then come back up. And with our logistics resupply missions, out of our Kennedy Space Center friends, they're going to supply logistics to the crews, to bring up the EVA suits. And so eventually, when we expand the Gateway a little bit further, we're going to go from this 30-day missions, to 60, to 90-day missions. So as Lara said, we're not 24/7, but we think as we go further, and the Gateway will enable, I’ll say expansion capability. There are plans out there for kind of your Mars transfer module. Certainly, technology demonstrations of those kind of systems. So yes, we're 30 days early, but we look to expand that. Because I think the more time you have around the surface, the greater the demonstrations of technology, the greater understanding of reactions with the human body in that environment. So, we've got initial plans, and then we've got some forward-thinking plans. And we're trying to make that happen.  Host: Absolutely. That practice is going to be absolutely critical. Now you've mentioned a couple of different elements Dan, so I'll pitch it back over to you to kind of describe what these are. You mentioned HALO, you mentioned PPE. Can you talk about some of these elements that will make up what is Gateway?  Dan Hartman: Sure. You know, in kind of a -- actually the first two pieces are critically important. The power propulsion element is actually being built by Maxar and managed out of the Glenn Research Center. It is your power supply, and it is your attitude control for the entire Gateway spacecraft. So, it has reaction wheels. It has reaction control systems to maneuver the Gateway. And you know, we want to conduct excursions around the Moon. Go to different areas around the Moon. And the power propulsion element is the device that's going to get us there mostly using new technology of the solar electric power. So, we're really looking forward to getting that element tested and delivered down to KSC. It also provides, like I said, huge amounts of power. Almost 50% of the power that we have on ISS is going to be generated out of the power propulsion element. And so that -- those two solar ray wings are going to be the entire stack of the Gateway. So critically important. Critically important. And it mates with HALO, which is a small logistics outpost where we can house the crews early. It has various docking ports on it that can accommodate both the lander and the logistics vehicle, as well as Orion. But on that forward port is where we will continue to expand the capabilities, and we'll eventually put the [International Habitation module] I-HAB there, on the other end of the HALO. Its primary function is you know, it provides some pressurized volume, some early utilization, which we think is critical. We've got some early payloads on the power propulsion element as well. But it is -- it's the nerve center, the command and control center for the whole Gateway. So, our command and control processors, the high-level software will be operating within the HALO module so. Both of those elements are currently on contract, in production, both nearing the [preliminary design review] PDR time period, and like I said, we're going to put those two together down at KSC. They'll fly together as one integrated package. It offers us the opportunity to really go test these two elements together. And then we'll launch in a single rocket that we also are very close to awarding. So, making great progress on power propulsion element, and the HALO.  Host: Very exciting. Lara, Dan is mentioning some scalable opportunities here. We're going to do this first, and then we're going to do this later. Can you talk a little bit about that? What those phases look like?  Lara Kearney: Sure. Well, we use the term \"initial capability,\" and then a “sustained capability.” Our initial capability should be ready in the 2024 timeframe. And it is the HALO and the PPE that Dan mentioned, along with the logistics element. So, for those early missions, you'll see a HALO and a PPE around the Moon. Orion will come in and bring the crew. And the lander would have already been pre-staged there. So, it's those elements together. HALO PPE, the logistics module, and with then Orion and the lander. And then as we move to the more sustainable, you'll see us bring in our international partners. Our international habitat. The Canadian arm. And then we have an element called -- what we're calling an [European System Providing Refueling, Infrastructure and Telecommunications] ESPRIT, which is basically like a refueling element. We'll be able to refuel and extend the life of the Gateway over time.  Host: Oh wow.  Lara Kearney: We're hoping eventually too, kind of later in our timeline, we'll see an air lock. So, we'll be able to do EVA spacewalking out of the Gateway as well.  Host: Very nice. So, Lara, you said -- I think the phrase was \"provide services\" earlier on when you're talking about what Gateway is, and how it kind of folds into Artemis. So, you're thinking -- you've got early stages, you've got later stages. Can you describe a little bit more why we need Gateway for Artemis? What does it provide for these lunar missions?  Lara Kearney: Sure. Yes. You know, there's a lot of different ways to go to the Moon. You know, Apollo was one of them, and those guys were super smart, and did a great job with the task they had at hand. Their objective at the time was to get there as fast as they could. You know, be the first there. And so, their mission was very optimized. They went around the equatorial region, and the spacecrafts were very optimized for a specific job. When we go back this time, we want to go in a more longer-term sustainable fashion, and we want to be able to explore the entire lunar surface. So, what the Gateway allows the overall Artemis architecture to do is have flexibility in where we can land on the surface, and the ability to re-use spacecraft. Where we already talked about the landers can kind of come and go from Gateway. The ascent element, as it comes from the Moon, back up to the Gateway, we can actually re-use it several times. So, in the long run, it saves us money, and just provides us a longer-term, sustainable program.  Host: Wonderful. I want to take a step back here for a second, because we've done a great job so far describing your experiences, and then what this Gateway is. But I want to take it back to the start of the program. Dan, tell me that story from when -- you already said you had a lot of experiences with international partners, and they said, “Dan Hartman, we want you to build this program from the ground up.”  Dan Hartman: Yes. And wow. It is truly from scratch. I felt pretty good about you know, my capabilities certainly with the international partners you know, and how to assemble a space station early on. And so -- but I didn't know very much about the Gateway. And so just trying to understand it, and then trying to think of the people, the right people that you want to put in place to help you go manage this. And so, I will tell you, you know, you are really defined by the people. And so, our program office is very small, very nimble. It's about 25 people. The center -- and quite honestly, the centers across the agency were very, very good to us, and enabling us to kind of look over the various -- the directorates at JSC and at the other centers, and really kind of I say pick our talent. And amazingly, it's an incredible group of people. A lot of diverse talent. You know, as -- a lot of young people that we're trying to bring in. We've got go-getters we call them, 5-stars, we put some people in stretch positions and you know, quite honestly, early on in the program, you have some time to go learn, and fix things if you know, if you do some mid-course corrections. But Lara and I really took it to heart to try to bring in and mentor some young talent. Because obviously we want to keep this pipeline of future leaders going. So, I'll tell you, like I said, the ability to go reach across you know, human health and performance, the engineering directorate, the Orion program, the EVA team, we were just able to kind of hand-select the people to make this whole thing go. I will tell you as well, the human resources side at the Johnson Space Center just moved mountains for us to be able to assemble this team fast and quick. And I'll tell you, it's kind of a one in a lifetime opportunity to get this ability to kind of hand-pick the folks that you want to work with, that have the talents that you need to carry out the program, we all work hard. We joke with each other. We care about each other. And at the same time, we have a little bit of fun along the way. So very, very proud of the team, and how we've been able to grow that bottoms-up. And I will tell you equally Gary, the talent that we have across the other centers, has been amazing as well. And so, you have the Glenn Research Center at the Kennedy Space Flight Center, as well as at Marshall. And we do have pockets of people that support us from other centers as well, but those three in particular, we stay well-tied together. And it's just a marvelous team that we've been able to assemble.  Host: Wonderful. Lara, can you go into more detail about what these different elements are? I'm hearing it's a small team, but what is the team here at Johnson Space Center focused on? And then it sounds like you have some cross-center help. So, we're working really across the nation here. What does that all look like?  Lara Kearney: Sure. Like Dan said, we're pretty small. Just you know, kind of as an example, the space station program office has you know, a couple hundred civil servants. Orion has about 60 civil servants. And like Dan mentioned, we're at 25. So, what that means is we heavily matrix support, not only from JSC, but as Dan mentioned, from other centers. And the way we are set up, we'll use the term Level 2, Level 3. We have a Level 2 program, which is really about the integration across the spacecraft. So, we have a program planning and control team that makes sure we're watching our schedules, and our budget, and the money is flowing the way it should. We have a [Systems Engineering and Integration] SE&I organization that worries about the integrated spacecraft performance. So not only the Gateway, but as our visiting vehicles, like the lander and Orion come and go, they're worried about how that overall integrated spacecraft is performing across our power systems, thermal systems, propulsion systems. We have a vehicle systems office that worries about basically the down-and-in systems, and how again, the spacecraft performs. We have an [Safety and Mission Assurance] S&MA office to keep our -- you know, the crew first and foremost in our minds. Make sure we're operating safely on orbit. And then we have an operations and utilizations office, who are folding in very early the crew operational needs, and how we're going to operate the spacecraft, again a little bit differently than we operate space station. But also, how we make the most of the ability to utilize it from a research perspective. So those offices are all here at the Johnson Space Center, sort of integrating across the overall program. And then we talk about Level 3. And we really -- we call them kind of our hardware development projects. Those are the teams that are ultimately responsible for delivering the hardware and getting it to Kennedy Space Center so we can launch it. The elements in there I talked to you about are power propulsion element is led out of the Glenn Research Center. Their prime contractor is Maxar. Our HALO happens to be led at Johnson Space Center. It is -- our contractor there is Northrop Grumman. Our deep space logistics is led out of the Kennedy Space Center, and it was recently awarded to SpaceX. And then our EVA team, we've actually been asked to manage spacesuit development for the overall Artemis program. It is managed out of Johnson Space Center. So, as Dan mentioned, between Glenn, Marshall, Kennedy, and Johnson, we work across those four centers really to bring all of those elements together into an integrated spacecraft.  Host: How about that? Now let's jump forward to -- let's just start putting these pieces together here. You talked about some of the first elements to launch. Dan, can you give me a sense of what we're planning right now in terms of how we're going to construct the Gateway in some of these initial missions, and how it's going to fit into -- maybe give us a spoiler, of maybe one of the early Artemis missions. Some of the profile of what astronauts are going to do when they launch from Kennedy.  Dan Hartman: Sure. You know, we made a pretty significant change about three or four months ago, where we initially had the PPE, the power propulsion element, launching and then we would launch the HALO on a separate rocket, and a separate tug, and they would do rendezvous and prox ops together and mate in the inner [Halo Orbit] HO orbit. We quickly found that we might have some schedule relief, and then quite honestly, some risk reduction activity if we integrated those two vehicles on the ground. And so, that is the plan. And so, we'll launch those in the September -- I mean the November of 2023 time period is the plan that we're on. It will fly around in this inner HO orbit, and like I mentioned earlier, we're going to have two payloads that we recently selected. We're kind of doing utilization a little bit differently than how we've done it on ISS. We have worked with the international partners to really go integrate the payloads and kind of share the development. And then also share the research with each one of the international partner providers. And so -- and we plan to do that not only on the outside, but also on the inside with some of the shared payload capabilities inside the HALO. And so, we'll be positioned. If you talk about the -- you know, obviously we won't be there for the Artemis 2 mission. For the Artemis 3 mission, we'll be in place, and you know, recently they kind of took Gateway off the critical path, but we think we have a lot to offer in the Artemis 3 scenario, being a say, a relay station for the comm to and from the Moon, and then to and from the Earth. And so, we hope to be major players in the Artemis 3 mission. Obviously, we're working very, very hard to get it up there in time. And then as you carry on with the Artemis 4, with a lander coming to the Gateway, Orion coming to the Gateway that is -- right now, the plans are -- that'll be the first time we actually aggregate at the Gateway and take a lander down to the surface from there. Obviously, we'll need logistics resupply, and so that will also be another piece of the hardware that comes up. All this is, you know like I said, when we launch the PPE and the HALO, our plans are to operate that out of mission control. We are trying to build in an extensive amount of autonomy, and so I don't think you'll see, other than the initial checkout, I don't think you'll see a control room, like you see in the MCC today for ISS, running 24/7. We're trying to have the systems onboard Gateway be as autonomous as they can. Obviously, if we have some anomaly, or if we have something that we need to go and investigate, we'll bring teams in, but we'll check health and status periodically, but we're trying to set this thing up to fly on its own. And so that's our goal. I'm sure we'll learn as we proceed through this, but I think it's a great way to go figure out how to live, or how to go operate around the vicinity of the Moon.  Host: Yes. How about that? That is kind of a different model of how to do things. There's a lot of -- there's a lot of pieces here. There's parts of the Gateway. You're talking about landers, you're talking about Orion. You already mentioned a little bit about the operations, Dan. Of how Gateway will be operated, kind of with these regular checks. But let's say we're in -- forward to an Artemis mission. Where Gateway is integrated into it, what does mission control look like? It sounds like there might be an Orion control room, and Gateway control room. How is that all going to fit together?  Dan Hartman: Still kind of formulating that.  Host: OK.  Dan Hartman: But like I said, when we actually have crew missions, that kind of gets you all hands-on deck. And so, I'm pretty sure, we as a Gateway control center will be staffed up as well as the MCC for the Orion vehicles. What we intend to do as well is, we're setting up our control centers for the -- I'll say for the -- for the Canadians, with the robotic devices. We are giving them effectively end-to-end responsibility for all the robotic activity onboard the Gateway. And that includes a control center that they'll have in Canada. That'll be able to operate remotely. Kind of like what we do on ISS with the [Space Station Remote Manipulator System] SSRMS. And so, they'll be a control center there for all the robotics. Initially with ESA, for the activation of the international HAB module, we'll have a control center up and running over in, I believe it's going to be in Germany. The Japanese are supplying a lot of components associated with the I-HAB. A lot of the thermal control systems. A lot of the environmental control systems. So, they plan to operate out of Tsukuba, where they operate you know, the JEM Module today on ISS. JAXA will be tied into ESA. And then ESA will be tied into the control center. And so -- and then with Canada. And so, we'll have kind of an -- you know, not as extensive of you know, kind of around the globe control center architect, but when things get critical, you're doing dynamic operation, we'll fully staff these control centers up. We'll have the MCC with a lead flight director, and kind of – during those times, kind of act like we do on ISS. So that's the plans we have right now. And I think that's how we'll end up going forward.  Host: Alright. Now, now Lara, you're coming from the Orion program earlier in your career, can you talk about how Gateway, the Gateway program is talking to the folks in the Orion program, in terms of the hardware development, in terms of the operations? Just thinking about doing things jointly for when Orion arrives at Gateway.  Lara Kearney: Sure. Yes. We use the term cross-program integration, right? Not only with Orion, but with HLS, the lander, as well. And it really happens at all levels of our organization. I mean, it starts kind of at the program management level. Dan and I you know, are in constant communication with our counterparts in Orion, Howard Hu and Lisa Watson-Morgan over in lander. And so, we communicate frequently at our systems engineering and integration level. They are constantly communicating with one another. We actually have established processes where we have representatives on each other's control boards. So, we're always aware of what's happening on the other side of the interface. So, a lot of it is just about communication. But then we also make sure things are clearly documented. So again, we can't have any missed communication. So, we start with things like ground rules and assumptions, where we write down things like \"Gateway does this,\" \"Orion does this,\" \"HLS does that.\" We codify it in what we call interface requirements documents, so it's clear there. And then we drive all of that down into our systems specifications. And eventually interface control documents, and it just, the lower level you go, the more and more detailed it gets, about how you interface between one element and the other. For us, a lot of that physical integration is done through our docking ports. So as long as we have -- we do have an international standard for that docking port that is between those elements. And so that controls things like how data flows, the power flows, fluid flows, through that physical interface. So, there's a lot that goes into cross-program integration. All the way from you know, the technical engineering up to just good program project management and making sure we're constantly communicating with one another.  Host: Now Lara --  Dan Hartman: You know, one thing that -- Gary --  Host: Oh, go ahead.  Dan Hartman: No, it's just to add onto that. You know, the big picture is we're relying on each other, right? So, when we first fly up you know, in the early stages of Gateway, and Orion comes up, we are basically dependent on their environmental control system, that'll extend out into the habitable volume of the Gateway. And then, and that's per let's say the 30-day mission. But when we get into the 60-day missions and 90-day missions, that role kind of reverses. We are thinking we're going to put Orion in somewhat of a dormancy mode, and then have the Gateway critical systems take over the functions that Orion was doing on the earlier flights. The same thing with the lander team. We are going to work with those folks, Lisa and her team, to really understand their logistics needs, and fly the suits up with the logistics. And take the burden off of what they think they need to launch, I'll say even with Orion. When they go fly, if we can pre-position food, pre-position some equipment, pre-position utilization. Even the utilization that might go down to the surface of the Moon on the lander, we're going to work as kind of a three-program triad to integrate that and make it all look seamless. So, like I said, we are -- interfaces are one thing, but our reliance on each other is growing daily, quite honestly. And I think that's a great thing. It keeps our systems working together, versus overburdened on individual systems.  Host: That sounds very big. And I think a part of this here, and you can correct me if I'm wrong. What I'm getting a sense of, you've used this word before, flexibility. The idea to kind of adapt to maybe how the mission changes, or maybe there's something interesting at a different part of the Moon that you want to change and go to. Is there a certain amount of flexibility when it comes to how surface missions change? You know, who knows what Artemis is going to bring in the future? It could be habitat, so we could figure out how people could live and work on the Moon for longer periods of time. It could be rovers. It could be robots. It could be a number of different things. Is there a certain amount of flexibility for Gateway to fold into that, and stage some of these things for whatever may come in the future?  Dan Hartman: Yes, we -- I, we -- primarily in that role with some of the surface systems you know, they're going to go down, but I see it on their own with their own landers and set up. Obviously, the crew that'll go will probably aggregate through Gateway and then go down with a lander. And you know, get in and perform some of the habitation system function that they'll do there. But we are setting ourselves up again, not only a lander, but additional assets that are on the Moon. As a comm relay station. So, different pieces off the Moon will send their signals back through, back through Gateway, and then we'll then pipe those back to the Earth. And so, I see that as a major advantage. And the other thing that we talked about a little bit earlier is that with our solar electric propulsion capabilities, we are able to move -- maneuver the Gateway to basically any orientation we need to reach different surfaces of the Moon. And so, while that's not in the initial plans on different excursions, the Gateway that we're building initially will have that capability. And then Lara talked about, we have a refueling capability with ESPRIT, and most likely on the back-end of the power propulsion element. And so, we can re-stockpile the propellant’s and the Xenon that's required to make the solar electric power operate for the long haul. Where we've got a design life of 15 years for the Gateway. You'll see we're going to be performing robotic change-outs of components, but as long as we can maintain the systems, we have the refueling capability, I see our ability to extend beyond 15 years kind of like in the light of what the ISS has done, right? Its initial 15 years, and here we are 20 years permanently crewed so.  Lara Kearney: The other thing Gateway brings to the table is not only support for the lunar surface missions, but Mars-forward as well, right? As an orbiting platform out there, we can be part of the proving the technologies and the resources that we would need for long-duration, deep space transport for a Mars mission. So that could be a future use for the Gateway as well.  Host: I love it. And Dan and Lara, you both described a little bit about the model for Gateway. Just how we're putting together this program and constructing it with international partners. There's this commercial element as well. So, Lara, can you talk about the commercial side of things, and how business for the Gateway program is done a little differently?  Lara Kearney: Sure. Yes. Again, we've talked about how diverse the Gateway team is, so you know, not only do we have ISS and Orion expertise, but we also have team members that came from commercial crew. So, you know, our agencies learned a lot about commercial partnerships, and what that means, and roles and responsibilities and accountabilities, and driving requirements. And so, we've really tried to take a lot of what the commercial cargo and crew programs have learned to heart in the Gateway program and allow our commercial partners and our contractors as much flexibility as we can give them in their design space. But it's a real balance, right? Because we can't give them complete autonomy, because ultimately, they have to all come together and we have to plug this thing together like a Lego, and it has to work on orbit, right? So, we can't -- the team is constantly looking for the right way to give them the flexibility that they need and minimize impacts. But find the very specific things we need to require them to make sure that it operates as it should when it's on orbit.  Host: You know, as --  Dan Hartman: You know right, Gary, that like Maxar, right? That's a -- geez, we -- that team was selected. They have I think 80 of their 1300 bus satellites in orbit, right? And so, we saw that as a tremendous way to capture that commercial market there, and utilize what they've learned, and you know, they're the primary source of our power and our propulsion. And so, we're -- again, there's just tremendous heritage there. Our HALO module, kind of borne out of a commercial aspect of the [Next Space Technologies for Exploration Partnerships] NextSTEP right, where we had several commercial companies out there kind of coming up with their ideas about how we should build a habitation module. And we selected one of those from that, be it Northrop Grumman. The logistics supply services out of Kennedy Space Center is heavily leveraging the commercial cargo program that we have in the ISS program. Very, very similar. Basically you're -- it's your UPS kind of truck thing. Here's the cargo that we want delivered, and you provide the services. We're going to turn it over to you. We'll see you at the Moon with our cargo. And so, that has worked well. Lara mentioned we're building the EVA suit in-house for the first initial mission. And then we plan to really open that up to I'll say numerous potential commercial providers, to produce the follow-on suits. And so, we're going through that discussion right now, but I see even the EVA suits maybe tending toward this path as well, along the commercial side.  Host: Dan, we're coming up on 20 years of continuous human presence on the space station. There's a lot that we've learned from that vehicle. Just so much in the way that even business is done, and it sounds like just from some of the elements you're talking about here, they're very much informing Gateway in some of our future plans. Can you talk about just the International Space Station, and how it kind of laid the foundation for what we're discussing today?  Dan Hartman: Yes. Sure. You know, there's a technical aspect of lessons learned, and there's somewhat a political aspect of lessons learned there as well. Maybe the political first, right? Working with our international partners, we have embedded them in every one of our teams, and so there's no separate kind of U.S. is doing its thing, and then we bring in the international partners when we hold meetings. They are actually active members of all of our control boards. And they have a seat at the table, a board member. We make key decisions, not only of our elements that we're working on with the U.S., but also you know, in relationship to the hardware that they're developing. I think that has really streamlined some of the integration that we have going. And I think it keeps the international partners that much more well-informed. And I'll tell you the other thing kind of politically is, we realized early on that early utilization on ISS really paid a lot of dividends. Those countries could show, even though their main elements weren't onboard the ISS early, the payloads that they had up there, they could show their constituents, their stakeholders, that they are part of the ISS program. So, we have folded in -- and I just can't tell you what a tremendous job I think our team has done, namely, Dina Contella working with not only the NASA research community, but all the international partners of just selecting those payloads internationally and weaving in our NASA priorities. And I just see that as a key way to get early research going. And some early return for like I said, those stakeholders. You know, if I think about some of the program and technical stuff, we have embedded our operations team into a lot of our early development, right? That may not have been the case early on in ISS. They are right there with us. You know, we've learned you know, some reliability, some redundancy, some -- you know, maintainability. How to really embed the operations team into the actual design of the hardware. So, I think that's one of the key areas that we're trying to apply on a daily basis.  Host: Unbelievable. Lara, this is such an exciting time. We're talking about this platform around the Moon. We're talking about people putting people on that platform. And then those people are going to go down to the surface of the Moon and put boot prints on the surface once again. Can you tell me what excites you about this whole thing?  Lara Kearney: Oh gosh, you know it's -- it's funny, you can get so into the grind of our job every day. It's good every now and then to step back and just look at what it is we're doing, and how exciting it is. And I get remembered of that every time we fly a mission. I was lucky enough to be a part of Orion’s EFT-1 in 2014. And I'll remember that day forever, because basically the world stood still. Not only in -- here in the United States, but globally. And you saw it happen again with the SpaceX launch to space station several weeks ago. So, you know, I think what inspires me almost the most is that we inspire the world. And they watch what we do, and they're excited by what we do. So, the fact that we can get a platform out there, and be sustained, and continue to push forward and help you know, our global community move into you know, deep space is just a really exciting thing, and I really love to turn and watch how the world reacts to what it is that we do every day.  Host: Such an exciting time. Dan and Lara, thank you so much, both of you, for coming on Houston We Have a Podcast today. I learned so much just about what this is, and honestly, got me really excited for what's to come. I appreciate both your time.  Dan Hartman: Alright. Thank you very much, Gary. Have a great day.  Lara Kearney: Thank you.  [ Music]  Host: Hey, thanks for sticking around.

                        "description": "Gary Jordan (Host):  Houston, we have a podcast. Welcome to the official podcast of the NASA Johnson Space Center, Episode 158, \"Moon Deliveries.\" I'm Gary Jordan, and I'll be your host today. On this podcast, we bring in the experts, scientists, engineers, astronauts, all to let you know what's going on in the world of human spaceflight. I hope you tuned into last week's episode on the lunar “Gateway,” where we talked with Dan Hartman and Lara Kearney. This is a critical element of what makes up NASA's Artemis program, returning a sustainable human presence to the Moon, and we're doing so with international and commercial partners. Now, before we get the boots of the first woman and next man on the Moon, American commercial partners will be sending payloads to the surface on commercially built and operated landers through an initiative called Commercial Lunar Payload Services, or CLPS for short. Landers, science and technology payloads, rockets, and landing sites have already been identified in this exciting new chapter of lunar exploration. So, to tell us more about the history, purpose, and progress thus far for this effort is Chris Culbert and Dr. Camille Alleyne, project manager and deputy project manager, respectively, for CLPS. So here we go. Commercial landers and NASA science coming soon to the surface of the Moon, with Chris Culbert and Camille Alleyne. Enjoy.  [ Music]  Host: Chris and Camille, thank you so much for coming on Houston We Have a Podcast today.  Chris Culbert: You're welcome. Thank you for having me.  Camille Alleyne: Thank you, Gary, for having me.  Host: Wonderful. I am very excited to talk about CLPS and very interested to see what this is all about. I'll be honest. I had to do a lot of research from the ground up on this one just understanding what this is, and I'm so glad to have you both on -- the people that are actually leading this effort. It's very, very exciting. Let's take a step back first and understand who is leading this. Chris, I want to start with you. Talk about yourself and your background. What got you to this position leading the CLPS effort?  Chris Culbert: Sure. OK. So, I've been around JSC for a long time now. I actually was the chief technologist, the center chief technologist, when the center needed some help running the evaluation board that was setting CLPS up. And I was having so much fun, I gave up the chief technologist job and stayed in the role.  Host: [Laughter] How about that? You have an extensive career with NASA supporting exploration and human spaceflight. Is that right?  Chris Culbert: Yeah. So, I've been here -- I've done almost everything you can do in the -- at the center, in many ways.  Host: I love it. I love it. Now, Camille, you're sort of the same. You also have a long career here at NASA.  Camille Alleyne: I do. Mine is going on 20 -- I think 25 years this year.  Host: Congratulations.  Camille Alleyne: Thank you. Mine started at Kennedy Space Center working on the space shuttle as a flight systems test engineer. Went through Headquarters in the early Constellation days and then came to JSC 13 years ago as the Orion crew module systems engineer. Since then, I've served in the International Space Station program as the associate program scientist. I spent a year at Headquarters actually, working in the Science Mission Directorate, which was really new for me because up to that point, I had only done human spaceflight. And so that was a great experience and really led me to the position I'm in now as the deputy manager for the Commercial Lunar Payload Services, which is -- yeah, and we'll talk about it. But my experience at Headquarters at SMD [Science Mission Directorate] really led me to this program, which has been really, really exciting.  Host: Wonderful, Camille. Now I'm going to stay with you because you already alluded to it. Commercial Lunar Payload Services -- what is this, Camille?  Camille Alleyne: So, Commercial Lunar Payload Services is one of NASA's most innovative public-private partnerships to date. It is our -- we will be leading lunar exploration efforts for the agency as early as the fall of 2021. And we'll talk a little bit about that, but it's really a delivery service that we are buying from our commercial partners -- something akin to FedEx or DHL to the Moon, where you buy -- we have science instruments that we want transported to the lunar surface, and we are going to pay commercial companies to do -- to provide that delivery service for us, \"us\" being NASA.  Host: Interesting. So yeah, instead of us building these landers, we are asking commercial companies to build them for us. And then what it sounds like is that we have a lot of payloads or science and technology instruments and demonstrations that we want to put on these landers. Is that right?  Camille Alleyne: That's correct. And I would correct one thing.  Host: OK.  Camille Alleyne: They're not building the landers for us. They're actually building their landers. These are their transportation vehicles, and we are just paying for the ride for our instruments to the surface. So, we don't -- we would not own the landers. The commercial entity owns the landers, but they'll transport our instruments for us.  Host: Interesting. Now Chris, you mentioned that you were there when CLPS -- the idea for CLPS was first coming about. Tell me about the genesis of this idea of this project.  Chris Culbert: Sure. The origination goes back into the 2017, you know, 2018-time frame. As the agency was having success with commercial cargo and commercial crew, there was some discussion about how we apply some of what we were learning there to what was going to become the Artemis program and the ideas in going to the Moon. So, the agency had already started work with some of the Google XPRIZE competitors, private companies who were competing for Google X money to go to the Moon. We were providing some technical support through a program called [Lunar] CATALYST, (Cargo Transportation and Landing by Soft Touchdown) but the obvious next step would have been to take the development a little further down the road -- give the vendors an opportunity to do what they do best while letting NASA focus primarily on the science and the technology we cared about. So, the strategy was built out of Headquarters. The Science Mission Directorate was asked to lead the program. They put together a source evaluation process that I led. The procurement was actually led out of NASA Goddard, and we put nine companies on contract. Putting them on the contract didn't actually win them any delivery service awards. All it did was said these are the companies we believe are capable of competing for task order awards. So, we spent most the year of 2018 going through the evaluation process and getting ready for the master contract. And then we awarded that near the end of 2018. And going into 2019 and beyond, we started working towards task orders.  Host: Interesting. Now how does this framework of adding all of these commercial companies to a contract in such a way that you described -- how does that compare to how NASA used to do business when it comes to these different either exploration -- different exploration efforts or other efforts? Is this sort of similar to what we've seen in the past, or is this a whole new thing?  Chris Culbert: This is pretty new, or at least the approach NASA's taking is fairly new. We're relying entirely upon the vendors' processes and vendors' hardware. As Camille noted, we don't even -- we don't own landers. We don't even evaluate the landers. They get to make their own decision about how to get to the Moon. They're responsible for contracting with the launch service providers. The simple model that we've talked about most frequently is think of FedEx to the Moon. We're going to hand them a package, and they call us when it gets to the Moon.  Host: [Laughter] I love that. Now, we're talking about the Moon here, and you already mentioned this program called Artemis. Can you describe what Artemis is and then how CLPS folds into that?  Camille Alleyne: So, Artemis is our human exploration of the Moon, right? So, it's sending the first woman and the next man to the Moon, but in a different way than we did it back in the Apollo era, right? We -- in the Apollo era, we went unilaterally, as a country, to the Moon. This time, we are bringing commercial partners and international countries. We're working with these entities to go to the Moon and be there in a sustainable way exploring the Moon so that it is used as a platform for us to eventually send humans to Mars.  Host: Interesting. Now, Camille, you already mentioned when it comes to CLPS, these landers are owned. They are the companies. They are -- they're not NASA's. The company will own and operate this lander. Why are we doing it this way? Why do we need a commercial service rather than just making something ourselves?  Camille Alleyne: Well, I think what we have found working with our commercial partners in the last few years is that, one, they're very agile and pretty nimble -- much more than the government is -- and they come up with more innovative solutions that sometimes we don't have as a government entity the bandwidth to explore as much. And so commercial companies, because they are driven by, you know, funding, our limited funding -- in this case, XPRIZE funding -- they're more innovative in terms of their solutions to the problems we have, and so they come up -- and having a lot more companies allows the government to have a better price point for these services. So, competing them across the commercial companies really allows a more competitive price for the government and more innovative solutions. So that's why commercial.  Host: So, Chris, there's a lot of science and technology that we want to get to the Moon through CLPS, but I want to kind of understand why are we doing it this way. Why are we doing it through this project to have commercial companies design landers rather than just kind of fold it into human missions and, you know, have humans, whenever they're walking on the surface, go around the surface of the Moon and throw around these different instruments? Why do it this way?  Chris Culbert: Well, we'll end up doing both, right?  Host: Oh.  Chris Culbert: But the human systems will take a little longer to get there. We're hoping to be there by 2024. But there is things we'd like to know about the Moon before we get humans there. And we can utilize both much smaller landers and hopefully, as Camille noted, a more nimble, more agile approach to getting things to the Moon early. And then even after humans get to the Moon, there'll be a much -- there'll be a wide range of things we'd like to do on the Moon that can't all be done at the locations where the humans are. So, we'll get more diverse science and science from different parts of the Moon if we have the ability to take instruments in a lot of different locations. And as Camille noted, the cost is significantly lower than a traditional NASA mission. So, we get more bang for the buck, if you will, by taking advantage of what the commercial landers bring to the table. It won't replace what the human systems do. They're still critical for human activities or the opportunity for demonstrations before the humans get there and the ability to land a wide variety of things in a lot of different locations can be done much more cheaply if we partner with industry.  Host: So, Camille, it sounds like --  Camille Alleyne: Can I add --  Host: Go ahead.  Camille Alleyne: Can I add to what Chris said, too?  Host: Of course.  Camille Alleyne: One, Artemis is about human exploration. It's about humans being able to live on an extraterrestrial planetary surface, which we haven't done in over, really, 50 years, right? But CLPS allows the science community, right, the international science community -- researchers, scientists, astrophysicists, geologists -- to be able to send instruments that can help them answer some questions that they still have, not just about the Moon, but there's so much the Moon teaches us about the evolution of our solar system and the evolution of our whole planet. And so, there is there a lot of unanswered questions within the science community. And CLPS, with our ability to send instruments on behalf of the scientists, allows them to answer those questions.  Host: So, that's an important mission there, Camille. Can you tell me what the expectations are for the companies that are building these landers to get that science, that important stuff, to the surface of the Moon? What is it exactly that we want these commercial companies to do?  Camille Alleyne: So, we want them -- so I'll back up a little bit.  Host: OK.  Camille Alleyne: We expect them to procure every piece of hardware they need to be able to facilitate the transportation of our instruments, right? So, they have to develop their lander. They have to procure their launch vehicle and any ancillary kind of hardware that they will need in order to accomplish this mission. But we are really, in essence, building a marketplace on the Moon, right? And so, this commercial model facilitates. It really enabled an economy to be built on the Moon where commercial companies can build up their capability and NASA eventually won't be the only customer that they are servicing. They would have the ability to service many other customers outside of the U.S. government. Other international countries or commercial entities or universities that want to independently send instruments to the surface -- they will be able to facilitate that because we have enabled them to develop these capabilities.  Host: Interesting. So, I understand like a lot of these early landers, there's a lot of NASA payloads in there. I think there's a few European Space Agency payloads as well. But from what I'm hearing, this can scale to a period where instead of NASA being the customer for these landers, they can expand. This is -- I guess the idea here is sustainability?  Chris Culbert: That's correct. What we're looking for -- NASA would like to be what we call the marginal customer, where we're just one of many people sending packages to the Moon, so that we only pay a fraction of the infrastructure costs. The FedEx model actually is a very good example. You don't have to buy a truck every time you want to put your package on a FedEx delivery. That cost is amortized across thousands of payloads. We're not there with the Moon today, but we're hoping that if we help get this started, it'll end up that way and NASA will have the option of being able to take a package. Right now, it's a -- you know, a two-year cycle to get ready to take something to the Moon. We'd like to reach the point where we can say, \"Hey, we've got a package we'd like on the Moon, you know, next week. Who can take it tomorrow?\" That's where we want to get to.  Host: Express delivery! How about that?  Chris Culbert: That's right. [Laughter]  Host: Now, Chris, you talked about being intimately involved in building the CLPS effort up. Tell me about how it works. You mentioned something called a task order. You were throwing around contracts. What exactly is the framework here? How does this work?  Chris Culbert: Sure. So, in many ways, CLPS, more than anything -- the CLPS project, more than anything, is a contracting vehicle. What we did was we selected, originally, nine companies. Then we added five more who said they were ready. We put them onto the master contract. They have to go through an evaluation process to demonstrate they have the ability to go to the Moon and understand what a lunar mission would look like. Then once we've put them on the master contract, they compete with each other. Only the people that are on the contract get to bid on a task order. So, we define our requirements. We say, \"Here's a series of instruments we want taken to this part of the Moon.\" We put out a task order, which is a written definition of our requirements. We let the vendors submit proposals, and then we review all those proposals and pick whoever had the best combination of price and capability to meet our requirement. That's called a task order.  Host: OK. So that's that framework. Now you did that for -- I guess let's go into what we have so far, the progress so far of what we have asked for, for some of these, I guess, task orders or maybe contract or -- yeah, it is task orders -- that have been awarded.  Chris Culbert: Yeah.  Host: What was it that we wrote down? What did we say? \"Hey, this is what we want. This is where we want to go.\"  Camille Alleyne: Sure.  Chris Culbert: Sure. OK. Why don't --  Camille Alleyne: But for the first one, it was a little different than, actually, how we've done subsequent. So, the first task order we call Task Order-2. We awarded two contracts to two companies that will be flying as early as fall of 2021 next year, which is pretty incredible in terms of the time frame. But what we did was we wanted to jumpstart the process, jumpstart the economy. So, we had a buffet of instruments on the shelf, NASA instruments on the shelf, and we said, \"We are going to offer you this buffet of instruments because you are just starting out.\" And remember, Gary, no one has ever done -- no commercial entity has ever done this before. So, we're really blazing a trail, right? And so, we said, \"We have this buffet of instruments. You get to select which instruments work best with the lander you are developing, or you are capable of developing.\" So out of those 14 instruments, two of the company -- the two that we awarded, selected different ones. One selected, actually -- I think ten will be flying on one, Astrobotic, that got an $80 million award, and Intuitive Machines will be flying five, and they got a $77 million award. So that first task order delivery was just jump-starting the economy. Since then, we've really focused on the science objectives, right? So, the science community along with Science Mission Directorate did a call for specific science payloads. And the science payloads were selected based on the objectives that the scientists want to meet on the Moon -- what they want to study, what they want to research. I talked about the research questions they want to answer. So those instruments were selected in order to start answering those questions. And then that package of instruments we'll give on -- we'll put on the task order. And so, the companies needed to now show how they were going to meet the requirement of those instruments. And so, since then, we have selected Task Order-19C. Masten Space Systems, a company in California, got an award for about $76 million, $77 million. They will be the first ones going to the South Pole with our science instruments. And then we just selected Astrobotic again, which was one of the companies that got the first award. They got their second award to transport the VIPER Rover [Volatiles Investigating Polar Exploration Rover] to the South Pole in 2023. So, to date, really, in the last year and a half, we have been able to award four contracts to jumpstart this lunar exploration science program.  Host: What amazing progress. That's incredible. That's -- we got a series of landers coming up in the very near future, and I can't believe the turnaround for Astrobotic and Intuitive Machines going fall of next year. That's very ambitious and very cool. So, Chris, where are they going? I guess what is -- where are they going to be going, and what exactly is the reason for them going to these places?  Chris Culbert: Well, for the first two awards, we let them pick where they wanted to go. And as Camille noted, we're being -- we're trying very hard to accommodate what the commercial vendors are capable of doing. So rather than telling them where we wanted to go, we said, \"You decide which payloads to put in your lander, and you tell us where you're capable of going.\" So Astrobotic is going to Lacus Mortis, which is a large crater on the near side of the Moon, and it's in the mid-latitudes. It's an area we haven't sent humans, but it has some very interesting geology features. And Intuitive Machines is going to Oceanus Procellarum, which is a dark spot we can see on the Moon. Both of those are areas that are mid-latitudes, relatively straightforward to get to. So, for the first demonstration of their capabilities, they're picking something that makes a lot of sense for what they want to do. As Camille noted, for the next two task orders, we're starting to focus more on the South Pole, which is where we expect to send humans.  Host: That one I know is a very intriguing spot for the Artemis program, like you're saying, to send humans. We got these permanently shadowed dark regions that are extremely interesting. And that'll be, I guess, the -- some of the first payloads, some of the first scientific instruments being sent to that region. Very, very exciting. Now you mentioned some -- Masten Space Systems in 2022, 2023. Camille, you mentioned a large number of scientific instruments that Astrobotic and Intuitive Machines could choose from, and you use the term \"like a buffet\" when coming to select some of these instruments. Does that mean that a lot of these were, I guess, already ready to go, and then from there, it was just a matter of the, I guess, respective companies choosing which ones that they wanted to send to these regions that Chris talked about?  Camille Alleyne: That's exactly right. I mean, we wanted to jumpstart the program, the lunar exploration program, and there wasn't enough time to go through the process of soliciting instruments, which in and of itself could take a year. And then once you get the instruments, then, you know, you release a task order, which is another set of month process. And so, in order to just jumpstart, as I said, the project, we allowed -- you know, we pulled these instruments off the shelf around NASA centers and offered it up to the companies to select which ones were capable with their lander. And these are a combination of spectrometers, magnetometers, a combination of imagers and cameras. So, all of these, again, are very much of interest to the science community to help them, again, start answering some of these questions that they have about the surface of the Moon and really the subsurface of the Moon, right?  Host: There was one that kind of piqued my interest a little bit when you were talking about some of these rovers. The one that's going a little bit later, it's something called the VIPER. That one sounded a little bit interesting because I believe it's a rover. What's VIPER all about?  Chris Culbert: Right. So, VIPER is a much bigger mission. The original two awards to Astrobotic and Intuitive Machines were both around 50 kilograms. VIPER is going to be closer to 500 kilograms, so, an order of magnitude larger.  Host: Wow.  Chris Culbert: And that is a NASA-built rover. We're building that inside the agency, actually here at Johnson Space Center. It'll be hosting instruments that come from across the agency, and the biggest one is a drill. So, it's going to go into permanently shadowed regions, which you can't really land in. Those are difficult places to land, you know, so you're going to land someplace where you have sunlight and a little clearer area to land in. And then the rover will drive the instruments down into a permanently shadowed region, drill into the ground to help us understand what kind of volatiles -- essentially, water and gasses -- might be buried or mixed into the lunar soil. And VIPER will allow us to gather data about those kinds of materials which might be fundamental towards enabling a long-term presence on the Moon because it might enable -- might show us where we can find water and oxygen and things that we desperately need for human habitation.  Host: That's a big mission, and a big engineering challenge, too. I mean, I can't imagine the difficulty of designing a rover that is going to drive into a permanently shadowed region. That's a very intense environment for any system, really, to operate in.  Chris Culbert: Yeah. They're very, very cold. Permanently shadowed regions can be as low as 40 degrees Kelvin, which is, if I remember right, something like minus 400 degrees Fahrenheit.  Host: Not an easy task at all.  Chris Culbert: Yeah, challenging environment.  Host: Yeah. Now let's go through -- I guess we don't have to go through all of them, but just a few of the interesting things that we're looking at because I love talking about science on the podcast, and there's a lot of science coming up in the very near future. Let's start with Astrobotic. Camille, I'll go over to you, and let's investigate just some of the instruments on the Astrobotic lander that's going to be at -- I think it's Lacus Mortis. I'm sorry if I'm pronouncing that wrong, but some of the instruments going there.  Camille Alleyne: That's correct. That's correct. You pronounced it correctly.  Host: Oh, good. [Laughter]  Camille Alleyne: So, there is an instrument called LETS, the Linear Energy Transfer Spectrometer, that's going to measure the lunar radiation environment. There is another instrument called MSolo, the Mass Spectrometer Observing Lunar Operations, and that will identify the weight of the volatiles that -- something akin to what Chris said, except not at the South Pole, but where they're going, which is a mid-latitude region of the Earth -- of the Moon. Another one is the Neutron Spectrometer System, which is indications of water/ice near the lunar surface. So that's just a sample of three of the several-instrument suite that Astrobotic will be taking with them.  Host: That's incredible. Now, this is a very exciting time because this'll be among the first two landers to go to the surface of the Moon in quite some time, and I know scientists have been eager. It sounds like they have a number of instruments that, Camille, as you described, are sort of off the shelf. They're pretty much ready to go, but they've just been waiting for this ride. So, it's got to be a pretty exciting time coming up here in the near future.  Camille Alleyne: It's a very exciting time for them, as you said. You know, we have not had a focus on the Moon for quite a while, right? We were focused on the International Space Station and focused on going to an asteroid and ultimately -- always our holy grail, right -- going to the -- going to Mars. And so, the Moon wasn't quite a priority. And so, scientists now, with this mission, are just, you know, chomping at the bit. Our lunar scientists are so excited and so energized and really, you know, looking forward to future missions. SMD had submitted what we call an RFI, a Request for Information, to the science community, and they got over 200 responses in terms of potential instruments that could be selected for transport missions. So, there's a lot of enthusiasm in the community around these missions.  Host: Oh, that's very exciting. Now, Chris, before we go on to some of the future stuff, I did want to investigate just a few items on the Intuitive Machines lander -- see what they're going to be taking to this dark spot on the Moon.  Chris Culbert: Intuitive Machines is going to take a number of other instruments. One's a good example of additional science. It's called ROLSES. It's a low-frequency radio observatory, smaller scale, on the Moon that helps us explore what kind of signals we can get from looking at photoelectrons. But we're also doing not just science, and the science, of course is very critical to what we're doing, but we're also doing technology demonstrations. So, let me talk a little about a couple of experiments that are flying on Intuitive Machines that help us prepare for future human missions. One is called the Lunar Node 1 Navigation Demonstration, or LN-1. It's something about the size of a CubeSat, a relatively small box, that allows us to demonstrate how autonomous navigation would work. These are the kinds of systems we want to use with the human systems when we take them. Flying them on CLPS in a smaller lander originally gives us a chance to test those technologies and learn how to make them work properly. There's also a camera system called SCALPSS [Stereo Cameras for Lunar Plume-Surface Studies] which will be looking at -- it'll be taking images, capturing video of the plume. As the lander comes down and the engine's firing to slow it down right before the landing, we kick up a whole bunch of dust, dust and rocks, from the plume from the engine interacting with the surface terrain. And we want to know more about how those plumes disperse the few -- the soil and disperse rocks and whether they can impact our ability to land larger landers. So SCALPSS will give us a chance to capture some data about that that we can factor into designing the human landers when we build them.  Host: Oh, that is very interesting. This is -- I guess, Camille, you know, one of the questions I had earlier was, you know, \"Why not just do this during the human missions?\" It sounds like there's a lot of technologies here that are part of the CLPS initiative that can actually be applied to the human mission.  Camille Alleyne: That's correct. The rover, for example, right? We know we're going to have rovers for the human mission, so that also is a learning experience for us. We are going to eventually have prepositioned hardware for the human missions -- communication systems, technology demonstrations, maybe some habitats that, you know, could potentially be flying on CLPS that are prepositioned and there in time for when we have astronauts on the surface.  Host: Very interesting. Now, Chris, there's -- it sounds like there's just been so much progress in such a short amount of time when you talked about in the 2017, 2018 time frame coming up with the idea for CLPS, and here we are in 2020, and we already have -- we have landers for all the way through 2023 at this point to be putting some very important scientific instruments and technology demonstrations, all this great stuff, on the Moon. There's so much progress already, but I'm sure there's more. What can we look forward to in the future here for some upcoming task orders and initiatives?  Chris Culbert: Sure. So, we will actually award two more task orders before the end of the fall. One will be another drill. It's a version of the drill we're taking on VIPER, but we're going to take it to the Moon early so we can test it and make sure we understand how the drill works in lunar condition. That will help us prepare for the very important VIPER mission. That's called Task Order PRIME-1. And then Camille's working on a task order, which takes the remainder of the instruments we got out of the Science Mission Directorate call last summer to the South Pole along with some technology demonstrations from the science -- Space Technology Mission Directorate to gather more data about conditions of the lunar pole. We expect to award both of those by the end of this fall, end of this calendar year. Then we'll hit a sequence of roughly two task order awards per year guided by the Science Mission Directorate. And then every other year or so, we expect to see other task orders based on either technology demonstrations or preparations for human flights. And maybe Camille can tell us a little about what kinds of things we think those will do.  Camille Alleyne: SMDs are sponsoring CLPS, right? They provide most of the funding for the CLPS contracts. But this is a mechanism for cross-mission directorate participation. So, as Chris said, the Space Technology Mission Directorate, they are already showing interest in flying technology demonstrations, and PRIME-1, as Chris just mentioned, is one of those. They will have some future technologies that they are developing that they would want to send on CLPS missions. And then the human exploration mission in preparation for Artemis, you know, and sustainable human exploration, they will be sending -- they will be interested in sending some larger payloads, perhaps some habitat-type hardware, again, pre-positioning for human exploration. And so, there's a lot of interest across the agency, right, in this project and in this contract mechanism because it just really is flexible, it's agile, and it allows -- it facilitates instruments, everything below human-scaled hardware, to be transported to the Moon.  Host: That is incredibly exciting. Chris, you talked about, you know, possibly two task orders being awarded per year. I can see this really ramping up here, especially when you're talking about how it folds into Artemis and how, you know, Camille described as jump-starting an economy. Now there's -- you're -- I guess you're trying to build a larger customer base on the Moon. Can you tell me about, Chris, your vision for what the 2020s are going to look like? Maybe sometime even past this -- you know, these first four task orders that you've awarded -- how you imagine business on the Moon through CLPS.  Chris Culbert: Sure. So, you know, a lot of this is, you know, polishing a crystal ball, obviously, and the one thing we tell everybody to remember is that none of the vendors have demonstrated they can successfully land on the Moon yet. That's an important first step. We're very pleased with the progress we've seen from the vendors we've awarded task orders to so far, but they'll have to show they can successfully, you know, get you to the Moon and finish that last step, which is pretty critical, of landing softly and safely. But we believe once they've done that, there will be interest in science communities, not just within NASA, but outside of NASA as well. We already know that Astrobotic is flying 12 instruments or 12 payloads beyond the ten or 11 that NASA is giving them, and they represent a wide variety of interests. You mentioned the Europeans. There's a couple of European payloads that Astrobotic is contracted to fly. There are some public interest payloads that Astrobotic is working with media companies and others to work on. So the opportunity to show off a growing economy, which has to be enabled by both commercial vendor success and some evidence that there is interest in things happening, but we're pretty confident if the price gets low enough -- and we're very pleased with the prices we're seeing so far -- universities might choose to fly a payload as part of a standard university grant process. There are -- just like we're seeing in low-Earth orbit, there are companies whose commercial interests long-term might be facilitated by enabling things to happen on the Moon. If VIPER, for example, is able to demonstrate that there is water buried in the regolith, or the soil on the lunar surface, particularly in the southern pole regions, companies might be interested in getting there to mine the water and then sell it back to NASA or other people visiting the Moon. So, I think there's a framework for a commercial industry that can emerge. It will depend an awful lot on, again, early success. If the first two landers both, you know, crash on the Moon, that will have a very chilling effect on the economy. But assuming they're successful, and we think right now that they're moving in the right direction, we -- I think you'll see a lot of potential interest shown not just in this country, but in other countries that don't necessarily have the full-strength space program the United States would have.  Host: What an exciting time. This is unbelievable. Now, Camille, adding onto this, Chris described so well the -- this economy that we're trying to build for deep space. What -- just, you know, this is a very futuristic concept here, but I know NASA has goals of returning sustainably to the Moon, as you just described, through the Artemis program and then having that inform Mars. So how does CLPS do that for the agency's overall broader goals?  Camille Alleyne: So, we often say that we are not in the critical part of Artemis, right, that 2024 landing, but we enable the Artemis program by being the trailblazers, as you will, to -- you know, to the surface. So that is one way. We are also demonstrating, really, and one of the most innovative private-public partnerships that NASA has ever had. You know, we've never done business like this with commercial companies before, where we don't actually help with the development of their hardware. We're just buying a service, as we talked about earlier. And so, there's a lot there that other aspects of Artemis could learn from this particular business model. One other thing I would like to say, though, that we talked a lot about instruments to the surface of the Moon, and that's primarily the objective of CLPS, but we are also looking at can our commercial companies provide capability to just orbit the lunar orbit, right? Maybe they are CubeSats or other type of communication satellites that need to be put in orbit around the Moon that our commercial companies can take -- either transport to orbit solely or transport to orbit on the way to the surface. And so that is another thing you will see coming up in the very near future.  Host: See, Camille, when you say very near future, I just get chills because I just can't believe what a time, we're in. You know, this is -- we're talking about the next decade here on just the landscape of the Moon changing entirely. So just talking to you both today, I could just say confidently that this has been a very, very exciting thing to talk about. Chris and Camille, to both of you, I really appreciate your time going through CLPS today, and just what a fascinating concept and project that you're both working on. I appreciate all you do, and I appreciate your time for coming on Houston We Have a Podcast. Thanks so much.  Chris Culbert: Thanks, Gary.  Camille Alleyne: Thank you, Gary.

                        "description": "Gary Jordan (Host): Houston, we have a podcast. Welcome to the official podcast of the NASA Johnson Space Center, Episode 160, \"Packing for Mars.\" I'm Gary Jordan, and I'll be your host today. On this podcast, we bring in the experts, scientists, engineers, astronauts all to let you know what's going on in the world of human spaceflight. Our Mars Monthly series continues. Last month we chatted with Paul Kessler who described the deep space transport, or the Mars transit habitat, a little bit about what that may look like, and its important segments. On this episode, we'll be focusing on what we need to pack inside of that transport. They'll of course need things that you pack on a normal road trip, food, water, clothes, but this road trip will be a doozy. You'll need to bring breathable air, running on super reliable systems, and enough spare parts to carry you through a multiyear mission, because there's nothing that you can forget. Once you leave for Mars, there's no turning around and no resupply vehicles to send afterward. So here to go into detail on what to pack for Mars is Chel Stromgren, Chief Scientist of Binera Incorporated and part of NASA's Mars Integration Group. If you ever need help packing for a road trip, this is the guy you'll want to call. Pack your bags and don't forget anything. We're going to Mars with Chel Stromgren. Enjoy.  [ Music]  Host: Chel Stromgren, thank you so much for coming on Houston We Have a Podcast today.  Chel Stromgren: Oh, good morning. Thank you.  Host: Alright. Very glad that you can come on. I'm very interested in this topic. I feel like if there was anyone that could help me pack for a road trip, it would be you.  Chel Stromgren: Yep, we've got a lot of experience planning for packing.  Host: [Laughter] Well, I'll tell you, it's got to take some background to get to this point where they're going to you and trusting you to pack for Mars and think about all the different things that you're going to need on this journey. Tell me a little bit about yourself, your background, your education, and some of the stuff you've done for NASA.  Chel Stromgren: Sure. Sure. I got to NASA kind of in an unusual route. Undergraduate, I majored in and got my degree in naval architecture and marine engineering. So, similar kind of challenges. You know, I was doing ship design, designing large cruise ships, navy ships, and I did that for a few years. Then I went back to graduate school at MIT and shifted a little bit into an area called systems management, which was really focusing on, you know, how do we take these complex systems like ships or spacecraft, how do we manage them in the most efficient way. How do we run them? How do we operate them? And a big part of that was looking at the logistics required. What are all the supplies we need? What are the spare parts? You know, how do we repair them over time to maximize the value? So, after doing that, when I got out, I was working for a number of customers, but NASA was obviously, you know, had a huge need in this area to plan space missions. So, I slowly got more and more involved with NASA and now, you know, I work as part of a team that really does, you know, all the logistics planning for these long-range missions.  Host: Alright. Well, tell me a little bit about what goes into that. When you're planning for a long duration mission, what are those key things you have to really bring in the front of your mind?  Chel Stromgren: Sure. Maybe I can use an analogy here. So, imagine you were going to take a road trip and it was going to be a three-year road trip in your car, but here's the catch, you can't stop along the way. You can't stop at a gas station. You can't stop at a Target. You can't stop at a hotel. You can't even stop at an auto parts store. So, everything you're going to possibly need for that entire three years you've got to bring with you at the start. So that's all the food you're going to eat, all the water you're going to drink, all the clothes you're going to wear, all the toothpaste you're going to use, and everything you need to keep the car running. Right? So, any spare parts, any tools, that all has to be packed. And then anything you're going to do along the way, any science, any exploration, any cameras. So, my job is essentially to figure out how do we do that? What do we need to pack in that car to start the road trip so we can complete the entire trip without any problems? And then to do that, of course, because this is space travel, with as little mass and volume as possible.  Host: [Laughs] Just that added little complexity there, huh?  Chel Stromgren: [Chuckles] Right. Exactly.  Host: Alright. So, tell me about some of those challenges, right? So obviously that's a challenge just in and of itself. I'm trying to image what that vehicle would look like on the road if I had to bring all of that stuff for three years. And I've got to say, if you're talking about bringing something small and light, I mean, that's a very difficult challenge because naturally I'm thinking something real big that's going to fit all of those things.  Chel Stromgren: Right. And that probably is the biggest challenge, because you know one way to approach this is just to be really conservative, right? You know, just pack a whole bunch of food to make sure we have enough, but as you said, you know, in a spacecraft, that's not really possible, especially when you're going to Mars, right? You've probably, with other people, heard this term, “gear ratio,” right? The gear ratio, which is how much propellant we need, you know, versus how much mass we have to push is really high. So, it's really imperative that we keep the mass down. So, we can't just be conservative. We can't just say, \"Yeah, we'll pack so much food, they'll never run out.\" Instead what we have to do is we have to look at a whole lot of historic data. You know, one of the huge advantages we have in my area is, you know, we have the International Space Station. And the International Space Station is probably the greatest possible laboratory I could hope for because, you know, we're doing it all the time. So, we can look in detail at how food is consumed aboard the International Space Station, what the variability is, you know, for different astronauts. And then working with others, like the NASA food lab, we can look at, you know, different levels of nutrition, what's required, what's the lifetime of different food items. So, we bring all that data together and we can actually build a probabilistic model of consumption rates, of, you know, different nutrition needs, lifetimes. And that lets us plan out, you know, in detail exactly what we'd need to bring in terms of food. And then we do similar things, you know, for all these other areas, for all these other packing, you know, clothing, hygiene supplies. And then, you know, because it's a spacecraft, even things as simple as water and oxygen, you know, we have to bring those with us. So, all those things get analyzed in detail. We build these models and that's really what allows us to kind of find that sweet spot of enough that we're going to be safe and healthy, but not so much that we're going to kill the mission.  Host: This is perfect. You're describing all these different considerations we have to think about and the ISS as a perfect model for thinking about that. But let's go into some of the challenges. What is this challenge that's presented in front of us for getting to Mars? I'm talking about the duration of the mission, the distance of the mission. What are the things we have to think about for a Mars mission?  Chel Stromgren: Yeah. And really the biggest challenge there is how long we're away without any kind of resupply. So, you know, the ISS, although it's been flying for over 20 years, we've never gone more than 120 days without resupply. We fly these cargo vehicles to ISS all the time, Cygnus and Dragon. So, you know, if we find out we're short of something on ISS, you know, it's never more than 120 days or usually less that we have to go without it. You know, the real challenge for Mars is, you know, some of these missions we're looking at can be up to three years long. So, you know, it's just that shear duration that makes it so difficult. And I'll give you an example, one of the biggest challenges we have is spare parts for the spacecraft. You know, the spacecraft is really complex and there's lots of things that can break. And although we understand the reliability of different things, it's really, really difficult to predict exactly what may break on the mission, right? It's kind of a probabilistic type of situation. So, we have to be able to figure out, you know, based upon the projected reliability, which spares we might need to bring to cover that entire three-year period. Because again, I can't stop at the auto parts store along the way. So just that shear duration and the isolation from Earth makes it absolutely imperative that everything is loaded up front. And it takes a lot of complicated analysis to even begin to try to figure that out and a lot of data. Again, you know, ISS is really key here. And, you know, for us it really benefits us to look at systems that are very close to ISS in nature so that we can take advantage of that 20 plus years of operational data to understand, you know, well how often do different parts fail. You know, what was the result of those failures? What was the best way to fix them during the mission?  Host: So that kind of informs when you're thinking about spare parts, it informs what that's going to look like, what the Mars mission is going to look like with the parts you need and then the number and the types of spare parts that you also have to consider when you're thinking about a Mars mission.  Chel Stromgren: Correct.  Host: Yeah.  Chel Stromgren: And then we have to get really creative, right? Because again, you know, we can't just bring a warehouse full of spare parts.  Host: Right.  Chel Stromgren: So, we have to start to get really smart in how we do things. And one of the big differences I'm sure we're going to see on a Mars mission is the astronauts are going to have to repair equipment down at a lower level. You know, in ISS, although you know obviously, spaceflight even to LEO [Low-Earth Orbit] is expensive, compared to going to Mars, it's relatively cheap. You know, most of the time we have the space shuttle and now we have other vehicles. So, in ISS, because they wanted to maximize the amount of time available for science, they repair things at a very high level. If something failed, they would essentially replace the entire box, right, no matter what failed within it. That's not an approach that's going to work with Mars because the mass of all those giant spares would be too high. So, the astronauts are going to have to start repairing things at a much lower level. They're going to have to start tearing down equipment. Like instead of replacing the entire dishwasher, they're going to have to go in and find the one part that failed and fix that part because, you know, from a mass perspective that's going to be way more efficient. But it's going to put way more of a burden on the astronauts because they're going to have to become, you know, essentially repairmen in space.  Host: I was going to say, for International Space Station training, they've forgone a lot of that system level maintenance that we saw a lot in the Gemini days and Mercury days, even Apollo days of fixing those tiny little components, knowing the guts of the spacecraft and some of those systems from the inside out. Space station training has evolved to really, like you're saying, just basic stuff. You know, if this breaks, swap this part. You've got this thing over here. And they try to make it, as you're saying, as easy as possible because the mission on the space station right now is science.  Chel Stromgren: Correct. To the point where they put quick disconnects on things. Right?  Host: Yes.  Chel Stromgren: They want to make it so easy that they'll set up five quick disconnects. You're absolutely right. The astronauts, because they shouldn't on ISS, they don't have to know how a specific piece of equipment works. They have to know the five plugs and disconnects they have to undo to replace that entire unit. Then it'll get disposed of and they'll just install a whole new unit. But you're absolutely right, they astronauts who go to Mars are going to have to have an intimate knowledge of those systems, so they can go in and replace an individual pump or an individual valve if it fails.  Host: Wow. Now in terms of the supply, you know, we're talking about a Mars mission and the analogy is so perfect of thinking about a car packed with three years of stuff. But I'm thinking about a Mars mission and it's maybe not as closed as that. I'm trying to think of opportunities where there might be little stations or places where you can resupply stuff. I'm thinking you could stage stuff in Mars' orbit. You can stage stuff on the surface of Mars. All ahead of time so maybe you can pick it up on the way and you don't need to necessarily bring your car or pack that Mars transit vehicle, you don't have to pack it full of three years of stuff. You can stage stuff ahead of time. Is that a consideration?  Chel Stromgren: Yeah. So, we're definitely looking at that. Let's talk about the surface first.  Host: Sure.  Chel Stromgren: Because you're absolutely right. I mean, obviously, you know, everything that goes to the surface, we're going to preposition. Right? It wouldn't make any sense for the astronauts who are traveling to Mars to take everything they need on the surface with them. So almost certainly, you know, there will be landers that go down to the surface that precede the crew that will carry the things they need on the surface. And that's all the stuff we've talked about, the food, the water, the, you know, the EVA suits. And it'll also include all the stuff they want to use to explore the surface, the science, the rovers, things like that. So, you're absolutely right. On the surface we will almost certainly preposition everything we need there. Although that does come with its own challenges, right? Because now you're talking about sending things out years ahead of time, you know, and making sure that they have a very high reliability of working for the first time the humans touch them after three years of traveling through space. But going back to the other analogy, so for the in-space duration of the humans traveling to Mars and could we position things like in Mars' orbit to be picked up? And certainly, that's an option and it would have huge advantages in terms of propulsion. Right? Because we could send all that stuff out on a nice slow transit ahead of time, low energy, you know, it would cut down on the prop requirements. And then we could minimize, you know, the mass of that crewed vehicle, which we want to go as fast as possible. But there are challenges there certainly from a risk standpoint because now if you think about it, I'm heading out to Mars and if anything happens to that cache, if for some reason I can't dock with that cache, now I don't have enough food to get home. So, you know, we are looking at those options, but it is a pretty significant risk trade to try to take that. You know, even if a case happened where we couldn't break into Mars' orbit, if we have all those supplies with us, there are often abort trajectories we can take. Right? We can alter the trajectory, head back to Earth, potentially without even going into Mars' orbit. But now if all that stuff is prepositioned, now it's a mission critical step that I have to be able to stop, dock, and get all that stuff, or I'm not coming home.  Host: Yeah. That is a big risk that you're introducing now. Yeah, you're right.  Chel Stromgren: Yeah.  Host: Anything can fail. That far away, anything could happen.  Chel Stromgren: Yep.  Host: And that's something you really have to consider for a Mars mission. What happens if, you know, you can't dock, or something happens where it doesn't line up the right way or you know? I'm trying to think of every possible scenario and yeah. That almost makes you want to, if you were packing this vehicle, pack it with just enough where if you couldn't dock for whatever reason, you can get home on rations maybe. But then the resupply vehicle would be nice to have. Man, it's got to be a nightmare inside your head trying to think of everything.  Chel Stromgren: Yeah. Correct. And an interesting one is kind of on the flipside of the coin, another way that we can reduce mass that we also study as part of this is trash. So, you know, it's kind of the heads and tails of the logistics world. We consume all these things that I'm talking about. At the same time, we're producing a lot of trash. And trash is a great way to reduce the mass of the crewed vehicle during the mission because what we don't want to do is, we don't want to keep all that trash onboard. We want to find ways to get rid of that trash as the mission's going on, so our vehicle is getting lighter and lighter. So, as the humans are generating trash, as we're using parts and producing spares, as we're producing waste gases and waste waters--I'm sure you're aware of the regenerative ECLSS [Environmental Control and Life Support System]. We want to recycle as much as possible so we can produce clean water or clean oxygen from our own waste products. But then things we can't recycle, we want to use either something like a trash airlock or a trash burning system to get rid of that stuff as quickly as we can and bring that spacecraft mass down. So that's the other side of our job is looking at, you know, not only how do we supply it, but how do we get rid of it once we've used it.  Host: Yeah that is a big consideration there too. I guess that's a benefit right there. You can kind of lose some of the mass, but it also is a consideration you have. I'm trying to think of other challenges along the way. One other thing that comes to mind is just the stuff you have. Right? Three years’ worth of stuff. Some of the hardware I think would be OK, but not everything can last three years. Right? I mean, I'm trying to think of just the food I have in my pantry.  Chel Stromgren: Yep.  Host: Only a few things I can think of really will last three years.  Chel Stromgren: That's true. And that is a huge challenge that NASA's working on. And you're absolutely right. I mean, you know, it's easy to react and say, \"Oh I can go down to REI and buy, you know, camping food that has an expiration date of, you know, 2035 on it.\" And while that's true, you can't live on that stuff for three years. Right? Because what happens is although, you know, it may be shelf stable for that long, the nutrients start to break down. And that food that is shelf stable for that long doesn't provide a full spectrum of nutrition. So, it is a balance. And what's interesting and very different from the space station is, you know, as part of these Mars mission that the [Mars Integration Group] MIG is planning right now, we're assuming that up to 50% of the food is frozen.  Host: Wow.  Chel Stromgren: And we have never used frozen food or even really refrigerated food to any serious extent in space before. So that's going to mean a whole new system on these spacecraft. I mean, we simply need to do that, well for two reasons. One is to keep enough nutrients in the food for that long and to keep this food, you know, edible and stable for that long, but frankly also just from a palatability perspective. You know, even on ISS the space food isn't--they put up with it for six months. They're astronauts. They're tough. But what we find is, you know, a lot of times many astronauts don't eat as much as they should. It's just not really that appetizing to a lot of the astronauts. So, you know, the goal is, you know, by using a higher percentage of frozen foods, you know, which is essentially, you know, once it's thawed out fresh food, you know, you can make it a little more appetizing, certainly more nutritious, and hopefully have a better profile for the astronauts over time.  Host: That's big. And also, I mean one of the things I'm thinking of is now you have a bunch of freezers carrying half the food for your mission. That's a lot of energy too.  Chel Stromgren: It's a lot of energy. It's a lot of mass. But, you know, one thing we've got at NASA is smart engineers. And they're starting to figure out how to use things like, you know, heat pipes out to space. So, let's use the cold of space to, you know, run the freezer instead of having to have, you know, a Freon system like you would in your house. So, I'm confident that, you know, those guys, the engineers who design that stuff can come up with a great freezer at a really low mass. And, you know, there may be ways to use those freezers on the way home. So, you know, as they get empty and we have, you know, frozen core samples from Mars, maybe we can put those frozen core samples into those very same freezers to get them back to Earth.  Host: Now, one more challenge I'm thinking of in terms of a Mars mission, and this is a little different because you've been referencing the International Space Station, which is a fantastic model. I think what changes, one of the main things at least for me that changes, is the environment. Now you're introducing a lot more radiation and possible environmental challenges on that transit. How does that inform what you pack?  Chel Stromgren: It is a major factor in a couple of different ways. And one of the biggest ones goes back to a topic I referenced before, which is the reliability of systems. You know, like it or not, most of our spacecraft systems are turning into electronic systems, you know, software controlled, certainly process controllers. And one of the big concerns we have is that, you know, as I move out of the Van Allen Belt and I'm in this much more severe radiation environment, is that we're going to see a lot more failures in that type of equipment. You know, we kind of know that from past experience, although we don't have a ton of empirical data on how that happens. And frankly that's one reason, you know, we want to leverage the lunar gateway so that we can start to get experience putting some of those systems outside of the Van Allen Belt, begin to understand what the failure rates might look like, so we can better plan for those failures and frankly design better systems, more radiation hardened systems, so we can protect against those type of failures when we go to Mars. You know, another way radiation can impact what we pack is we need to provide radiation protection for the astronauts, you know, both from background cosmic radiation, but if there's a solar event during the mission we already know we're going to have to have some kind of solar storm shelter that the astronauts can go down if there is a solar particle event during the mission. And one way to provide that, you know, is to use the logistics we already have. If we have a bunch of water, if we have a bunch of bags packed with food and spare parts, we can arrange those logistics in a way that, you know, they can form a fairly substantial radiation shelter for the crew. So, you know, when we're talking about packing the spacecraft, it's not only fitting it in, the radiation guys are doing their, you know, 3D radiation modeling to try to help us position all those logistics, you know, particularly around things like the crew quarters, so we can get that safe haven.  Host: That's going to be very, very important. This will blend into our next topic real nicely. We talked about a lot of the challenges that are facing us on this journey to Mars. Now and you've already alluded to a lot of them, but let's go through this packing list here. We've already talked about food and, you know, half of it being frozen. We've talked about the radiation shelter. That's something you absolutely have to have onboard. Let's talk about, you alluded to this one, the regenerative life support. Now what's that going to look like?  Chel Stromgren: Sure. It's one of my favorite topics. So, you know, of all the advances we've made on ISS in terms of, you know, designing spacecraft, I think one of the biggest ones is what we call regenerative ECLSS and it's kind of a fancy name for saying recycling. So, you know, one of the biggest needs that humans have to keep alive in terms of mass is oxygen and water, right? We consume a huge amount of oxygen and water. And those are also very difficult things, they're heavy things to deliver into space. So, we certainly don't want to go to Mars carrying in tanks all the water and oxygen we would need to get the whole way. It would be tens of thousands of kilograms of extra mass we would have to push. So, what a regenerative ECLSS does is it takes the human waste products and essentially, either through filters or through chemical processes, recycles them so we can use them again. We sweat, we perspire. These systems will take that humidity out of the air. It'll take our urine and it'll put it through a series of advanced filters and chemical processes and produce clean potable water. Similarly, as we exhale and we produce carbon dioxide, we can collect that carbon dioxide, put it through a chemical process called a Sabatier, and it also produces clean water. And then finally, we can take that clean water, put it through an electrolysis system, and that gives us fresh oxygen. So, it's this complete cycle of taking these waste products and running them through these various processes and at the end we get clean water and oxygen out of it. And we can basically do that to such an extent that we don't have to carry really any additional oxygen and water. We get a little water through the food we consume and through metabolic processes and by doing this recycling we can make up the difference. So actually, when we leave for Mars, and I mean we'll have a safety store of oxygen and water, but we basically bring no additional oxygen and water. We recycle that the whole way there and back.  Host: That is huge. I mean, that's a lot of mass you're saving right there.  Chel Stromgren: Yeah. It really makes the mission possible in my opinion.  Host: Yeah.  Chel Stromgren: It simply wouldn't be viable to push that much. And then, you know, joined into that we're also looking at things we can do on the surface to supply new water. You may have heard the term ISRU, In-Situ Resource Utilization. So, when we get there, we're pretty sure there is water on Mars, so you know for the surface we're starting to do experiments now. In fact, the next Mars lander is going to have a test experiment of this. We want to be able to take, you know, gases out of the atmosphere, we want to be able to take water out of the ground, clean that, and use that on the surface. Because again, you know the gear ratio is even higher to get to the surface. We don't want to land any water or oxygen or as little as possible on the surface. So, if we can get to Mars and, to violate the initial analogy, actually stop and pick up some supplies at Mars, that certainly helps a lot as well.  Host: Alright. Yeah. That is really limiting the amount of I guess water and all of those consumables that you need for that mission. That is huge.  Chel Stromgren: Yeah. And, you know, really if you talk to anybody about space exploration, it's really the key to opening up the solar system. Right?  Host: Yeah.  Chel Stromgren: Humans have got to learn to live away from Earth. We're not going to be able to continue to bring everything with us we ever need. That's simply not sustainable. So, the more we can recycle, the more we can make use of those type of products that we find along our way, the easier we're going to be able to get further and further out into the solar system.  Host: Now on this topic of recycling, this is one that I'm extremely curious about because I know how they do it on the International Space Station, their clothes. I know they only wear them for a very specific period of time, and it changes with their daily clothes versus their workout clothes. But they trash it. They only wear it for a little bit and then they trash it. So, what are we thinking about for Mars?  Chel Stromgren: We're exploring various different ideas. You know, frankly that may be the way that we go forward. Although we're getting better at it. What you're referring to on the ISS is they're starting to use this new advanced type of clothing that has silver impregnated to it. Silver is a natural biocide, so it's going to kill those things that come out in your sweat that start to cause things like smell. So, you can wear a pair of silver impregnated t-shirts for weeks and it really doesn't get stinky. So that helps a lot. So, you know, we're not talking about, you know, having to bring a new shirt every day. It's maybe a new shirt for every couple of weeks. But to go further, you're absolutely right. We'd like to avoid that all together. And NASA does have some programs that are starting to look at a space laundry. You know, we'd certainly like to be able to do that, to bring a couple set of clothes that can last three years and just to clean them as we go along. But there are some pretty huge challenges there. One is, you know, any type of water based laundry gets really difficult because again, you know, now although as we discussed with this regenerative ECLSS we could probably recycle that water but it makes the amount of water you need for a laundry is really large. So, it would make those systems much, much bigger. And, you know, there's problems with the surfactants, you know, the type of things that are in laundry detergent that make them work, make the water much harder to recycle. But there's some really good ideas that are being looked at. I know NASA's looking at microwave-based laundry cleaners, things that expose the clothes to the vacuum of space to try to clean them. So, we'll continue to look at those things and we'll really try to hammer that clothing mass as well. Because you're right, it does seem crazy to, you know, bring three years’ worth of clothing and then just toss them out as we're going along.  Host: Right. Yeah. And if you have that ability to wash it or I guess disinfect it, that's an interesting idea to microwave or expose it to vacuum. Yeah, just the idea to clean it, that really limits the amount of clothes, number of clothes you really have to bring so that's awesome.  Chel Stromgren: Yep. Yeah. Yeah. So that's one of the many technologies we're going to push to try to reduce that logistics mass.  Host: Now, OK other things you need to pack aboard, obviously, you know, one of the main things you need for any trip is hygiene and care items, your toothbrush, your toothpaste. Now you're talking about maybe toothpaste that's got to last for three years. Any unique considerations there?  Chel Stromgren: Yeah. Hygiene supplies and even clothing to some extent get interesting because people have such personal preferences, right? You know, for a lot of the stuff we send into space, you know, NASA has their standard NASA issue items. But particularly when it comes to hygiene supplies, you know, people like very specific things. So actually, NASA has a fairly advanced process to qualify items. And even on ISS there's a whole catalog of items that astronauts are allowed to choose from, and they do get to choose. They have a mass allocation and the astronauts, before they go up to ISS, get to go through and, you know, say, \"I'd like that shampoo and that deodorant, and I like this toothbrush and this flavor toothpaste.\" And to the extent that they can be accommodated, they can even ask for additional things to be put on that list. So if there is a very specific type of moisturizer that the astronaut really wants to have, as long as it's not too challenging, it can be qualified, you know, making sure it's not flammable, that it's not going to be a problem in the ISS atmosphere, and then that can be added to that catalog. So, it's a little thing. You know, it ends up being very complex because we have to go through this qualification process, but, you know, I personally think it's absolutely critical to the astronaut's kind of wellbeing. Right? The little things like that, you know, being able to have something that they're used to using at home, takes away or helps to take away a little bit of the stress from these long spaceflights. So, we want to absolutely accommodate that type of thing as much as possible. So, you might have different astronauts with an entirely different hygiene kit, you know, kind of depending on what their preferences are.  Host: Alright. Yeah, that's very similar. And I know those hygiene items, just from talking to some hygiene folks on this podcast actually, I got to understand that some of those hygiene items that are on that list are approved for that ECLSS system so it's not going to affect it in any way.  Chel Stromgren: That's right. And that's part of that testing I was talking about.  Host: Yeah.  Chel Stromgren: You know, any spacecraft like this, particularly when we're talking about regenerative ECLSS is an incredibly complex, you know, closed biosphere. So, you know, it's tough to imagine the downstream effects, you know, just if somebody has a new spray on deodorant that has some kind of chemical in it, you don't ever know how that's going to get brought into the ECLSS system. It could start to foul filters. It could start to cause problems later on. So, there is an awful lot of analysis that has to take place to make sure that, you know, anything we bring is really benign. And as you said, on ISS it would be bad enough if it could cause problems, but you know on Mars if you weren't really careful about that, and those systems failed, you know, that could be deadly. So, it is an incredibly intense process to make sure that everything is all compatible.  Host: Now, we're talking about a lot of things you need to bring, your classic road trip sort of things, but we are going to be on this vehicle and that vehicle needs to have certain capabilities for the people inside. And I know one of the top considerations, and this is a big one even for International Space Station, is exercise equipment. What are we thinking?  Chel Stromgren: Yeah. Exercise equipment is a huge challenge for various reasons. One is, you know, exercise is not only, you know, just to stay in shape, it's one of our primary kinds of medical counter measures. Right? So, you know, one of the big challenges we face in general is these long periods in zero gravity or micro gravity conditions. And we're starting to understand a lot more from our research on ISS how that can cause problems for the health of the astronauts. And, you know, one of the best ways we have to counter that is for the astronauts to do exercise. So, it's not only kind of yeah, we need to keep you in cardiovascular shape, for all those things like bone loss and things like that, the exercise helps with things like that. So, in fact, we anticipate doing even more exercise on these Mars missions than they do on ISS now. And they're already doing a lot of exercise on ISS. So, we want to make sure we have systems that absolutely maximize that value. So, NASA's actually doing kind of a test right now for the next generation of exercise system. On ISS, you know, right now we have various treadmills that they use, they have bicycle ergometers that they use, and then they have resistive devices, which, you know, kind of simulates weightlifting, that type of thing. NASA's looking at systems that really start to maximize that and combine those functions more like in a universal machine. You can do more different types of varied exercises, you know, so they get around the boredom, exercise for muscles, so they're more effective. So, we hope once these tests are done that, we'll get an exercise system that not only is way more effective but weighs a lot less. One of the big problems we have with exercise systems is the isolation, you know, isolation from the systems. You know, you can imagine a treadmill creates a huge pounding force that can essentially, you know, in something like a space station could rattle the entire thing if it wasn't very isolated. So, we not only have this big complex treadmill, we have to have this very complex isolation system, so those forces don't get in. But now as we're moving forward, we can design things, you know, more advanced systems, you know, better analysis. We hope to be able to get those systems much smaller, much lighter, but again, be much more effective.  Host: Yeah, that'll be big, combining all of those things and making them smaller. Big challenge definitely ahead of you.  Chel Stromgren: Yep.  Host: The other one is, and this one I know just from not only the space station, but we have something here called [Human Exploration Research Analog] HERA where they simulate long duration missions and basically the human element of living together. This makes me think of living areas and sleeping areas. So, what are we thinking for a Mars transit vehicle?  Chel Stromgren: Yeah. And again, like so many of the things we've discussed, it's this balance. Right? You know, there's a desire from, you know, the propulsion guys to make things as small and compact as possible, but from a human health and human, you know, wellbeing side, we have to make sure that the astronauts, you know, are well taken care of. So, you know, we take things like sleeping spaces, personal quarters. You know, obviously the most efficient way would just to be have, you know, one space that's, you know, they'd just sleep wherever they are. They all sleep together. We don't have to have private rooms. But, you know, you can imagine on a three-year stressful journey that's simply not going to cut it. So, we know that the astronauts are going to have to have their own sleeping space. And a space that they can go to for privacy, right? Sometimes they're just going to need to get away from everything. Maybe they want to go watch a movie or they want to, you know, record a message for their family. So, you know, what we anticipate for this Mars spacecraft is it may be a little more sumptuous than we're seeing on ISS. You know, each astronaut's likely to have their own little cubicle. And look, it's not going to be the Ritz, but, you know, it'll be enough space where they can, you know, not only lie down, they might have a bench in there where they can sit, again read a book, with a closing door, with some acoustic insulation where they can really just get, you know, that time alone that they need. On the other side, we also need to encourage socialization. Right? We don't want people, you know, just working all the time and then going off on their own. So, we're also planning spaces where they can play games. You know, they will definitely have some kind of war table where they can sit and have meals, where they can play a card game if they want. We're trying to make sure that they have enough open space that they could play a ball game or something. Right? We saw this on Skylab where they were very innovative. They ended up using a ring of lockers as a track that they could run around. We saw that they used that open space to play catch. We think things like that are very important. You know, that just downtime, relaxation. We really want there to be at least one big open space. We want there to be a place where they can sit down and watch a movie together. So, there'll probably be a space where they can sit down with a large screen, you know, with enough places that they can all sit there as a crew and spend time together and watch a movie if they want. So again, very carefully balancing that need to keep things as small and tight as possible with keeping the crew healthy. And a lot of that is just going to be through smart reuse of spaces. Right? You know, we've got to have spaces that are reconfigurable. So, you know, the place where they exercise during the day, you know, we want those exercise systems to be able to fold away. So maybe that's the same place they can all sit and watch a movie at night.  Host: Interesting. OK. Yeah, they have their own personal space to do these activities, but it can be interchanged. Very interesting.  Chel Stromgren: Yep.  Host: I know another one is I'm going back to food here for a second. But you did mention a lot of frozen food. I know there's been experiments on the space station for growing plants and even recently they were able to eat some lettuce. So, is there any thoughts about adding possibly a farm for some fresh grown food on the way?  Chel Stromgren: We would love to get there. You know, the advantage to that would be huge again, just from a nutrition standpoint and a psychological standpoint. But there are some pretty significant challenges.  Host: Sure.  Chel Stromgren: You know, growing, you know, although with new aquacultures and things we're getting better about water usage, growing plants does require additional water in the cycle. Now again, we can, by using our regenerative systems, we can recover a lot of that water. So, it may not be a huge burden, but it does make those systems more complex. The other challenge is again, you know, similar to that caching we talked about before is just the risk. You know, if you are depending on those plants growing and something happens, you know you get a system failure, the plants die, you get some blight or disease in there, now you don't have enough food. So, my guess is, you know, at least initially we're probably not going to have, we're not going to depend on those foods. I think we'll still do it. We'll grow lettuce. We'll grow cucumbers onboard. But it'll be more for variety than replacing, you know, the other food we need to bring.  Host: Got it. OK. Now, of course there's, you know, we're talking about things to do. Right? We're talking about their exercise, their gaming time, and just movie time. They're going to have a lot of time to kill here on that nine months. So, I'm sure some of it is going to be dedicated to science and experiments.  Chel Stromgren: Yeah. So that's an interesting analysis. The MIG is doing a lot of crew time analysis to see what the crew might be doing during that journey. We will make free time for science. I don't want to imply that we won't. But to some extent, you know, I don't think the crew's going to be sitting around looking for things to do. You know, we discussed before on ISS we went to this repair concept where we just swap out big boxes, specifically so that we can create crew time to do science. And that on the Mars vehicle, because of mass reasons, the crew will be doing a lot more detailed repair. So, you know, one thing we anticipate is that the crew's going to be spending a significant portion of time just maintaining the spacecraft because things will fail. I mean, we know that. Things fail all the time on ISS and the crew repairs them. So, the crew will spend, you know, some time, \"Hey, you know, we've got to replace this pump. We know it's about to fail.\" And there will be a lot of routine maintenance. You know, there's a lot of filters, smoke detectors, things like that are going to have to be replaced. So, there will be a chunk of time doing that. But we will make sure there's time to do science. So, we will put capabilities in place to do some experiments as we go along. And it'll be a unique opportunity, right? Because although we may do some longer missions before then, it'll probably be the first time that humans spend three years in space. So, a lot of those will be human experiments really upon themselves, measuring their own condition, their own, you know, neuromotor function, and things like that just so we can monitor how they're doing as they go along. But there'll be other things. You know, this will be, even when we're in orbit around Mars before we go to the surface, it'll be the closest humans have been. So, we'll take that opportunity to survey the surface, to do things like that. So, there'll be a lot of, you know, we want to maximize the value of the time, both when we're at Mars and on the way there. So, we'll make sure that they're doing the right things.  Host: Absolutely.  Chel Stromgren: Yeah.  Host: Absolutely. Now, we're at Mars. This brings up another thought just on the idea of packing. And we've talked a lot about just on the way to Mars things you have to have onboard with you. You did mention at one point when we were talking about the In-Situ Resource Utilization, the ability to have consumables onboard. And that makes me think of picking up stuff on that stop you're making at Mars, whether it's on the surface or otherwise for that surface mission, pre staging more stuff to stock up on for the way back home, maybe extra clothes, maybe extra spare parts that you're putting on the surface of Mars. Is that a consideration or is that a little bit farfetched?  Chel Stromgren: Probably not on the surface because, you know, you wouldn't want to put things on the surface that you wanted to use in space just because, you know, the hardest thing we do in spaceflight is getting off the surface, whether it's Earth or Mars or wherever, right? That's the highest energy. So, you know, we wouldn't want to put stuff on the surface because the amount of propellant we would have to put on the surface also to get that back up to orbit again would be crazy. But again, we discussed a little bit before, caching, you know, in Mars' orbit, you know, that's something we definitely need to investigate. And you're right, you know, maybe you can do it in a way that's smart and reduces the risk. You're right. I may want to have enough contingency food that I could limp back home if I didn't make that rendezvous. But, you know, I might be willing to risk having stinky clothes. I might be willing to risk that, you know, I don't have my full 50% of frozen food on the way home. So, in that case, you know, I could kind of split the difference and say, \"OK well I'm going to put some of this stuff pre-positioned in Mars' orbit in a logistics module. I think I can still get home if I miss that rendezvous, but under normal operations I would make that rendezvous, restock everything, you know, get new food in, new clothes, pack all my trash in a logistics module and continue the mission.\" And that may be a good way to kind of, yeah like so many things, a nice compromise to, yeah, I'm not pushing all this mass, but I'm not endangering the crew if I'm not able to make that rendezvous.  Host: This is absolutely fascinating. Now I'm thinking about the short term here because we talked this whole time about a Mars mission, and you talked about this right in the very beginning and it excited me because we actually just did an episode on the Gateway.  Chel Stromgren: Yep.  Host: But I feel like there's so much from Gateway that we can learn, whether it's systems, whether it's operations, what have you, while this thing is around the Moon that can inform what you pack on this Mars transit vehicle. So, what else? What is the full scope of things that you're excited about for Gateway?  Chel Stromgren: Yeah. So, I'm actually a big fan of Gateway and I think it provides a lot of things for NASA as we move forward. One is, you know, and people I think don't realize this, just the value of it being a pit stop. A place, you know, because I am a logistic centric guy, a place where you can collect logistics. So, when we're doing these missions in the future, and it won't just be a mission to Mars. You know, we might precede that with a Venus fly-by. We might precede that with just, you know, a long mission around Earth and solar space to test things out. We don't have to be able to deliver everything directly to the spacecraft we're going to use for those missions, because often that can be time sensitive. Right? We can use Gateway as a warehouse, in fact, to build up logistics over a number of years before we have to depart. So, you know, you're probably aware that there's this new Gateway logistics service where we're going to hire private companies to deliver logistics to Gateway. Essentially what we can do is we can take advantage of that every year, collect the logistics we need for these longer missions like the Mars missions at Gateway, stage them there, and then launch that spacecraft empty. Again, much easier to launch when it's empty, and then load all those logistics from Gateway when we're ready to go. So that in itself operationally is just a huge thing. That's the same reason we want to run the HLS missions to the Moon out of Gateway. We don't want to have to launch everything we need to go to the Moon with that lunar lander, because that's very heavy. Right? So, things like the food they're going to consume on the surface, the EVA suits they're going to use on the surface. It's much better for us to launch that via this unmanned vehicle to Gateway, meet the lunar lander there, and then load that stuff in there so we can go down to the surface. Again, so operationally I think Gateway makes stuff a lot easier. But it's also, you know, I said before how ISS is the best possible experiment. Well, Gateway is gen two of that best possible experiment. So, you know, although ISS is mature and sometimes hard to put new capabilities, we can put those new capabilities into Gateway and test them there. And again, now we're beyond the Van Allen Belt, so it's a more analogous environment to what we're going to see going to Mars or Venus or somewhere. So, when we start looking at things like the radiation impacts, the deep space impacts, even things like communication delay, because we can certainly talk about that because that's another huge operational issue, the Gateway is a better analog than even ISS. So, we can get closer and closer to the actual mission, test things in that relevant environment, and make sure they really work.  Host: Yeah. Let's investigate that for a little bit, that communication delay. Does that impact what you have to pack onboard or I guess the operations along the way as well?  Chel Stromgren: To some extent it impacts both. So, you know, we know that the astronauts are going to have to be more autonomous. You know, if anybody's kind of seen ISS operations, the astronauts get a ton of support from ground control. You know, they always have the experts standing by in ground control and certain things like when they're doing repairs, they have somebody constantly talking in their ear. Right? So, the astronaut, you know, may not have to have read the entire manual. They've got the guy with the manual on the ground who can say, \"If you look three inches to your right, you'll see the right wire. Now, turn it a quarter turn counterclockwise.\" The further away you get from Earth, the harder that operating mode gets. Right? Until you get to Mars where, you know, the roundtrip can be, you know, almost an hour. So, you can't sit there and say, \"Oh, do I cut the red wire or the blue wire?\" And then wait for an hour to learn the answer. So, to some extent, the astronauts are going to have to be more self-sufficient in doing everything, you know, running the spacecraft, controlling their own lives, certainly in things like doing repair and doing science. And that puts a lot more burden on the astronaut, but it also requires new systems. And a lot of those are going to be training systems. NASA's going to have to develop systems that train the astronauts to do specific tasks during the mission. Because they have human limits, right? I think James Michener wrote that, you know, the Apollo astronauts learned as much as the human memory could possibly take about that spacecraft. They simply couldn't have learned anymore about the Apollo spacecraft because it was so complex. The Mars spacecraft is going to be ten times more complex than that, so they simply won't be able to know everything. But, you know, if they're about to do a specific repair, they have to repair the water processor, what we want to be able to do is have remote training, which includes maybe 3D interactive training onboard, so prior to doing that repair then they can become experts on that specific repair they need to make. So, you know, maybe they can virtually repair it ahead of time. They can get the knowledge from the experts on the ground so that when they go to repair that water processor and they have that one-hour communication delay they can still proceed reasonably well, and they can be expert enough to effectively execute that repair. And that's going to be a huge challenge, you know, just being able to do things without constantly checking back with ground control.  Host: Now, let's Chel, let's play king for a day. I'm going to go back to Gateway here for a second. And the reason I want to focus on that is because that's coming up here in the near term. We're talking the next few years having the Gateway as this test bed to figure out what we're going to need for a Mars mission. So if you were king for a day, what were some of those things that you would have the astronauts do that you would put on Gateway that you want to verify to make sure that everything you're thinking for packing for a Mars mission is going to work when we actually make that Mars transit vehicle?  Chel Stromgren: Yeah, so there's various things that we're talking about doing on Gateway. You know, one of them, and it'll be a combined ISS and Gateway, but again, the next generation of ECLSS system. We talked about ECLSS a lot in the past. The ECLSS community is constantly trying to improve those systems based on lessons learned on ISS, trying to make them more efficient, so we can close that loop even more, you know, recover more water and oxygen. But, because we depend on those things so much, we have to make sure they're reliable in space. So, to me it's absolutely critical that we get those things on ISS first and then on to Gateway, again because of the different environment, because of the isolation, because of the radiation. We need to test those in both analog environments and get as much run time as possible. Because it's not just getting up there and making sure they work. It's getting them running for a long enough time that we start to understand the reliability and the failure rates. And that's true for all these systems. You know, we're going to have advanced communication systems. We're going to have advanced avionics. We're going to have advanced thermal control systems. You know, from the packing side of me and understanding the reliability and understanding all these repair activities, I want to get as much time in space with and without crew as possible so I can understand those systems as best I can before I leave for Mars. So, to me that's the number one. The number two, you know, is what we just discussed is to start to develop these new types of procedures that allow the astronauts to work more autonomously. I mean, again, you know, we're not talking hour delay when we're at the Moon. We're talking, you know, maybe 12 seconds roundtrip. But that's enough that it breaks that instant chain, right? It's not, you know, like we're talking now where I talk, you answer, I talk, you answer. It's a I've got to compose my thoughts, transmit it, they compose a response, and transmit it. And so even getting as far away as Gateway starts to give us that real world experience of OK, now I have to fix this thing. I'm not going to have instantaneous feedback. So, we can start to test things like autonomous training and start to really understand from a human perspective, you know, how do you teach a guy in this stressful environment who's not an expert on this system to make these types of repairs. So, personally I want to make sure, you know, if we are going to go down at this lower level of repair, that we start to test those kind of things at Gateway so we can, you know, really understand how to train the astronauts to do them in space.  Host: You know what's exciting to me, Chel, is just how soon this is going to happen that this is something that's in the very near horizon we're going to be able to test some of these things. And it gets me excited about the Mars mission, which is again, sure in the future, but man this is a new generation we're talking about. What are your feelings about the Artemis mission and going forward, laying that foundation and testing all of these critical things like regenerative life support, making sure that, that's ready for a Mars mission? What excites you the most?  Chel Stromgren: I think what excites me the most is you can kind of tell the atmosphere around NASA has changed a little bit. You said something interesting. You said this Mars mission's off in the future. And the whole time I've been working for NASA, you know, the Mars mission was always 20 years away. Didn't matter when you were, it was 20 years away. You know, we were always kind of focused, well we're focused on ISS and we're focused on SLS and Orion. The difference in the last few years is, you know, although we are focused on HLS and Gateway, there's a much more of a feeling of this is really leading to an actual Mars mission. And I think a large part of that is the establishment of the MIG. You know, the MIG is not designing, you know, a Mars mission, you know, theoretically that could happen sometime in the future. They are designing, you know, the Mars mission we think we can actually execute in the 2030s. And then they are working backwards from there to define exactly what capabilities need to be developed. And then we are absolutely trying to make sure that the development of those capabilities get incorporated in what we're doing in ISS, Gateway, and HLS. So, there may be aspects of HLS that are done not because they're optimal for HLS, but simply because they support this future Mars mission. Because we don't want to get stuck in this 20 year away paradigm. We want to start working through those challenges. So, we're 19, 18, 17 years away and we actually can get there.  Host: That is big. Chel, thank you so much for coming on Houston We Have a Podcast today. This was so fascinating to just hear all of the stuff you need to consider for a Mars mission. And then what's really exciting to me is we're going to be testing a lot of those things in the very near future and getting a good foundation. And you're going to see the hardware that's going to come up and is going to really make that Mars mission, as you're saying, more of a realistic thing. Man, that you can actually put your eyes on it. Wow, this is something that we can actually use for Mars. Very, very exciting stuff. Chel Stromgren, thank you for coming on today.  Chel Stromgren: Oh, thank you. It was great. Hey, it's great that people can understand a little bit more about some of these challenges.  [ Music]  Host: Hey, thanks for sticking around. Really fascinating conversation we had with Chel Stromgren today about what to pack for Mars. I really hope you're enjoying our Mars Monthly episodes that we've been doing here on Houston We Have a Podcast. This is the fifth in our series. You can go back and listen to them in order or not, up to you. The last one we did was 156 with Paul Kessler about the Deep Space Transport. Another one I would suggest is 157 where we talked to Dan Hartman and Lara Kearney about the Gateway. We made a lot of comparisons to Gateway during today's episode, so if you want to know more about that vehicle, go ahead and check out that episode or any of our I guess, 160 episodes that we've done of Houston We Have a Podcast.

                        "description": "Gary Jordan (Host): Houston, we have a podcast. Welcome to the official podcast of the NASA Johnson Space Center, Episode 163, “Next Gen STEM.” I'm Gary Jordan and I'll be your host today. On this podcast, we bring in the experts, scientists, engineers, astronauts all to let you know what's going on in the world of human spaceflight. This one is for the students and teachers out there that want to get involved with NASA, even getting some experience with NASA before you hit college. NASA has some exciting ways to get involved in America's space agency and get real hands on experience. An, initiative called Next Gen STEM is doing just that. And, there are some incredible challenges to get involved with, where students can contribute to NASA missions directly. On this episode we're bringing in Jamie Semple and Mike McGlone education specialist and coordinator, respectively, based here at the Johnson Space Center to talk about some of the more recent challenges and how you can stay tuned for some upcoming opportunities. Let's get right into it. Of course, after our opening music. Enjoy.  [ Music]  Host: Jamie and Mike thanks so much for coming on Houston We Have a Podcast today.  Jamie Semple: Thanks, Gary. It's great to be here.  Mike McGlone: Thanks, Gary. Very glad to be back on again after a couple years ago we did a fun one, looking forward to doing it again.  Host: Yeah. Mike, it's been a while, that’s right. We did Microgravity University, MgUE was the last thing we talked about. This one's a little bit different. It's called Next Gen STEM. There's a lot of really cool challenges coming up in the very near future and some that have already taken place. And, we're going to recall some of the ones that have been, I guess, just recently passed. So, this is very exciting. Some of the opportunities that can be for students. I want to get a little bit of a better understanding of who we're talking to here. Just some of your background so we know who are the people that are actually leading some of these activities that get students to participate in actual real-life NASA missions. Jamie we'll start with you.  Jamie Semple: Sure. So, I actually started my career doing research. I was actually part of the team that did the nutrition science research out of the University of Alabama Birmingham. I originally graduated from Stanford University with a biology degree. And, while I was working in the laboratory. I really was interested in actually moving on to teach and actually coached, coached basketball specifically. So, I went ahead and actually completed my masters in secondary education. And, then from there went on to teach high school and middle school science as well as coached football and basketball. So, I really enjoyed that. And, in 2006, I had the opportunity to come to Houston to join the Space Center Houston Education Team at the Official Visitor's Center for Johnson Space Center. And, I was there for about six years. Really enjoyed working with the team there and the programs. And then I had the opportunity to come to Johnson Space Center and specifically the Office of STEM Engagement, which at that time was actually the Office of Education. So, was there for about six years as well. And, really enjoyed just being part of the NASA family and being able to serve and you know, to provide education programs to people around the nation. I did go ahead and explore some different opportunities in 2017, but I made my way back to Johnson Space Center at the end of 2018. And, I've been working on the NASA App Development Challenge ever since. So, looking forward to sharing some information about that today.  Host: Well, very good. And, so nice to have you back. I'm zooming in here on the part of your career where you were going for a science degree and then somewhere in there you got passionate about teaching others. Was it, was it a moment, some event that you went out and you were teaching, and something just clicked where you're like, “oh wow, this is awesome, I can actually influence other people's careers? This is what I want to do.” Was there some moment that, that made you want to change your career path?  Jamie Semple: I wouldn't say a specific moment. I was always a big fan of NASA and was really interested in what was going on with the agency. I actually grew up west of Houston, Katy, Texas. And, I remember coming to Johnson Space Center as a little kid. So, I always enjoyed the, you know, seeing what's going on and very interested in the space program. I also like working on teams where I can help others be successful. So just as I was thinking about those things and enjoying coaching basketball. And, just wanted to try to, you know, bring all those things together. So, been very lucky, like I said, I was lucky to be able to come over in 2006 and actually join the Space Center Houston team and actually come onboard with Johnson Space Center and the Office of Education. So, it's been, you know, close to I would say 12 years now in space science education. But I really have enjoyed the opportunities to be able to just serve the community and obviously teach as many as people as possible.  Host: Very good. I'm very excited to get into some of those things that we're doing here at NASA. But first, let's go back over to Mike. Mike, a little bit about yourself.  Mike McGlone: Sure, you bet. My background is in STEM education and training. I've been a classroom teacher, teaching mostly high school sciences. I also worked in the nonprofit career for a while doing informal education and training of volunteers. I came to NASA first in 2004, working with a group at the time, Aerospace Education Services Project, which did teacher development programs, teacher education throughout the United States, also did student programs, etcetera. Had to leave for a while. There was the shuttle program, some cutbacks. So, I spent some time then doing online education and developing science curriculum and activities. Then we had everybody come back few years ago and now to the Office of Education now Office of STEM Engagement. And, I've been working on these new student challenges, which is our purpose for today, you know, about getting kids excited about NASA and getting them actually involved in the missions.   Host: Well, let's go right into that Mike. Both of you mentioned starting in the Office of Education. Now it's called NASA Stem Engagement. So, Mike tell me a little bit more about this. What is, what is STEM engagement?  Mike McGlone: You bet. I guess it started about two years ago, but about 18 months ago it became official, we moved to the Office of STEM Engagement. And, what it was, more than just a name change. We really wanted to focus on engaging students. And NASA's mission, I mean, that's actually, kind of our tagline to inspire, engage, educate, and employ. Go out and talk to folks about the STEM pipeline. You know, kids, students out there that are working towards STEM careers, which of course NASA employs hundreds of those and through our contractors, thousands of those. And, we need to keep people moving along that pipeline to get involved. So, what we want to do is focus on those activities that actually engage the students in our mission. From the simplest things of, you know, watching an eclipse or watching a launch and doing some things to, in fact an activity we're going to talk about today where students are actually doing some basic research and designing of materials and software that may actually be used in future missions.  Host: Oh see, that's very significant. It's not just like a random exercise, this is actual, practical research and experience. Someone can lock on to it and then find that there's actual use to some of this. And, if they find it fun and interesting, perhaps dedicate their careers to it. As per that last thing you mentioned, Mike, that was the purpose and the goals of STEM engagement, that last one, being employed, getting more people to go into STEM fields.  Mike McGlone: Yeah. Most definitely, just touched on that. You know, it is one of those things we keep hearing about from Congress, national leaders is we need more folks involved in the STEM fields not only at NASA but across the country. Of course, we're interested in the NASA folks, but yeah, it's definitely something very important to the country.  Host: And, you're talking about a whole range of programs. How do we do this? How do we engage students and get them to this point where they're actually considering or at the very least participating in STEM activities, being science, technology, engineering, math? What's the whole, if you were to take a whole snapshot of STEM engagement and all the activities that's being done within that office, what kinds of things could you expect to do?  Mike McGlone: Oh wow. It's a long, long list, which we don't have time to cover it all today. But I can give you a brief overview. And, I think Jamie will jump in with a few of the, some specifics. But we have programs that are designed everywhere in both the formal and the informal education world. You know, we focus at students that are K through 16, so it's not just your elementary, middle, and high school students. We have, there are programs out there for college students, even graduate level, even some post doctorate things. It includes internships for those students. And, it could be as simple as activities that teachers can use in the classrooms about Artemis, like the SLS or the Orion, to very simple things such as, during a launch, we put together education kits that teach students about like, the recent Commercial Crew launch that we had back in the end of May, first of June. Some of the more in-depth things are such as, the challenges and that Jamie and I are going to talk about just a little bit more here today.  Host: Yeah. Let's go right into that then. Jamie, so the topic of today's discussion is Next Gen STEM. That's one of the many, I guess, activities that fall under the umbrella of STEM Engagement. Tell me a little bit more about this. What's Next Gen STEM?  Jamie Semple: So, Next Gen STEM is actually a project composed of a variety of different items. And, Mike touched on a little bit of those. But, pretty much is an integrated portfolio of everything from activities to educational products, grants, partnerships, and then student engagement opportunities. Primarily focused on the idea that we want to be able to provide an opportunity for K through 12 students to directly contribute to our NASA's project and mission goals. So, that development challenge and the word challenge are actually under that project umbrella. And, within Next Gen STEM, there's quite a few different things. And, Mike talked a little bit about those. But they're really focused in the four key areas, our mission driven focus areas. There is Commercial Crew, Aeronautics, Moon to Mars, and STEM on Station. And Mike and I actually work on the Moon to Mars team. And, within that specific project, there are actually five student challenges. There are educator guides. There are a lot of different resources available in regards to current projects that are going on. Like, Mike talked a little bit about resource kits for upcoming missions. There's actually a Mars 2020 toolkit that is available online. So, there is a wide array, excuse me, there's a wide range of different activities and opportunities for people to get involved with. So, if you look at some of the other focus areas, there's virtual reality fieldtrips, there's a citizen's science guide, and there's videos. There's actually opportunities for professional development through the Educator Professional Development Collaborative. So, there's a lot of different things. But the main goal here is to get, get people excited and spark their interest in STEM. Really focus on showing them that there are ways to be involved in STEM Careers. And, then just giving them that opportunity to contribute to what NASA is doing. So, that's exactly what that development challenge and the WEAR challenge fall in place.  Host: There's so many elements to this, Jamie. It can be a little bit overwhelming just diving into the list that you were going through. I'm trying to think about myself. If I was a, if I was a teacher, if I was a student and I had general interest in participating in some of these. I know a lot of people engage with the Commercial Crew Program, with the Demo-2 mission, Bob, and Doug launching to the station and returning home to Earth. A lot of people engaged in that. But, now there's actually a chance to participate in some of that program. And, you guys are part of the Moon to Mars, so some exploration initiatives. Very, very exciting stuff. But, if I were to look at that, I'd be kind of overwhelmed right off the bat. Oh man, there's so much. There's all these different resources that I can go. Where do I start? Jamie, if you were to, if you were to say this to either, either a teacher or student or someone that was eligible or I guess interested in investigating some of this, where would you tell them to start? To at least get their toes in the water here.  Jamie Semple: Yeah, great question. So, kind of depends on which group you're in. But definitely go to the Next Gen STEM website. And, that will give you an opportunity to obviously see what, they can click on the different mission focus areas and see all the resources that are available. Like you said, there's just a lot of great products out there, great activities and things that people can participate in as well. So, another way to get involved and actually get updates on what's going on, more current updates, is the NASA Express. And, you can actually sign up for that email. And, you'll get updates on what's going on as far as projects, challenges, live events, kind of like what you were talking about with Demo-2 and of course the upcoming Crew-1 mission here in a few months. So, you definitely want to sign up for that, especially if you want to get those, you now, specific up to date opportunities via email and see those as they're coming out. And, then also NASA social media. I know that both Mike and I, for our student challenges, we actually utilize that to get information out about information sessions or in the case of our challenge start date or our kickoff events. So, we definitely utilize that as well. So, there's just a, like you said, there's a lot out there and there's a couple different ways that you can actually find out what's going on in regards to the office of STEM Engagement, in this case Next Gen STEM.  Host: Now Mike, I'm listening to some of these resources that Jamie's pointing out. And, I think what's nice about this is we're in this interesting time where COVID-19 has a lot of us working from home. I know NASA, us specifically at the Johnson Space Center, many of us are at a work from home status. But, seems like a lot of these different resources that you can access are online and available, either if you're going into the office, performing jobs there or school. Or if you're like us and you're stuck at home. There's a lot of these, there's ways to access this information even during COVID-19.  Mike McGlone: Oh, most definitely. If you go to the webpage that Jamie mentioned, at NASA.gov/STEM, it'll take you to our page within NASA that breaks down all the activities. And like you were talking about, what do we have for students? What do we have that will be of interest to educators? And, even for students it breaks it down to their age range. And, a new product that we actually did, as COVID-19 actually, you know, took off back in April, we went through a lot of our activities and pulled them together in a product we call NASA at Home. And, these were activities that, as a group of our educators went through to actually review and said, “hey these are things the kids actually could do at home. They fit in their curriculum. Where does it fit?” Either to help supplement what the teachers are having them do for classes or just something to do for the fun of it. So, and that's all pulled together like you were saying it is a plethora. Trying to keep up with it will drive you a little bit crazy. But there is plenty of stuff there to look at. And, it's broken down, like I said, in a really nice way. You can look at it, you know, by grade. Are you a student? What are you looking for? You know, do you want to be a NASA intern? Do you want to be, are you in kindergarten and looking for something to do or looking at it with your parents? It's just a great site to go and find what you're looking for.  Host: This is perfect. And, I know this can be overwhelming. So, I'm lucky to have both of you on today because you are leading specific challenges that we can dive into now. So, going beyond this cloud of information, all of these different resources that you can access, let's dive into -- these, some of the specific things that can be done through this program through Next Gen STEM. Jamie, I know you're the lead for the App Development Challenge. This one sounds interesting. I know you had some experience with the App Development Challenge before. Tell me a little bit about this.  Jamie Semple: Yes. Very excited to launch year-two of App Development Challenge. All the information that we've talked about today is actually available on our ADC website. And, that's NASA.gov/education/appchallenge. But this is year-two. Our pilot program year, last year, we actually collaborated with the Ascent Abort-2 team, or the AA-2 team to actually have students build an app out of visualized flight data for the flight test that took place in July of 2019. So, it was a great pilot program year for us. We had the opportunity to bring a couple teams down to the, to the flight test at Kennedy Space Center. And, we're actually building off the success of that pilot program year to launch the new challenge, which is actually open for registration right now. And, in just a few days we will actually have our live virtual kickoff event on September 30th. So, this year's challenge, we are collaborating with the NASA Space Communications and Navigation Team. Their acronym is SCaN, so we'll refer to them as NASA SCaN. So, we are partnering with SCaN to have student teams create an app that will visualize the South Pole region of the Moon. So, as everyone talks about the Artemis program and us returning to the Moon, this is a direct tie into exactly where future exploration will be. So, we're very excited that we can offer this to the middle school and high school students throughout the nation. So, we're looking forward to getting the challenge up and running on September 30th.  Host: You know, if I'm a middle school and high school student, I'm trying to remember myself back in the day. And, I'm hearing this, right. I'm hearing, “hey you have an opportunity to come up with this great way to map the polar region and to do all these fancy space things.” I mean, the first thing that comes to mind is I'm immediately, Jamie, I'm immediately overwhelmed. I'm like there's no way that I have the skill set to do this. I mean this sounds pretty cool. But, how can I contribute to something like this? I don't have any experience. I might not be the right person to do this. Tell me about the, you know, the whole challenge and the ways to make it accessible to those that might be interested and take this opportunity to learn how to do it, for those that may want to participate but, at this point, are kind of scared to.  Jamie Semple: That’s a great question and comments regarding the challenge, we have worked very hard to make it more accessible to the students. This is a highly rigorous challenge, you know, seven weeks, it's a very short time frame that you have to create an app. So, teams that are registered to actually build the app, actually have to have a minimum of five students. They also have to have a lead teacher. And, there's more information on the website regarding eligibility and actually, how to register a team to participate. We do, we'll provide a lot of resources along the way to help teams be successful. On September 30th when we have our live kickoff event, we will actually have on our website, the ADC guide. And, that guide will give you all the specifics and details on how to participate in the challenge. And, exactly what we hope to see with your team’s lunar South Pole app. So, in addition to that, we will also provide a lunar data file. That’s the actual data, it’s the position and slope data from the area that we want you to visualize. So, you will actually have both of those components. And, then during our live kickoff event, we'll talk about how to get started in developing your app. So, if you have an interest in coding, computer science, obviously you're going to have to work with some other folks. But, a minimum of five students makes up a team. There is no maximum team size. So, you can have as many folks as you’d like to participate in the first phase of developing your app. And, then along the way, we're also going to provide live virtual connections, where we actually have subject matter experts from NASA, talk through how to develop an app. So, we'll be supporting teams that way throughout the entire challenge.  Host: See, that's a great way to kickoff. If you have a basic interest in space and you have a basic interest in coding and software, which I know is a very big field and with a lot of opportunities. This sounds like an amazing opportunity. I wanted to zoom in, though, on this Ascent Abort-2 App Development Challenge that you had. This is something you already did. You have a, you have a case where you tried something new and you saw it through to the end with results. Can you tell me more about that challenge? How the students engaged with the Ascent Abort-2 and some of the things you saw at the end of this whole process?  Jamie Semple: Sure. Yeah. So that was our pilot program year. So, we were trying to obviously figure out how to navigate a new challenge and provide it to students at the same time. So, it was very interesting. But we do have a technical advisor from the Ascent Abort-2 team. We have to do this same thing with this year's challenge. We actually have a technical advisor from the SCaN team. And, last year, with the Ascent Abort-2 challenge, we were able to provide resources and best practices along, I think it was a seven-week time frame for teams to develop the app. So, we had a great response, a lot more teams involved in the challenge than we thought. And, honestly, we received some great videos of the team’s apps and then honestly, we were just thoroughly impressed with the work that they did. Making this a team-based challenge is something that very closely mimics what NASA teams do throughout their work as they seek to collaborate, to successfully complete a project. So, having that same dynamic will help them understand the challenges and how you overcome those as you're actually, in this case, building an app. But, it's tremendously successful. We did take two teams to the flight test in July of 2019. And, they were actually able to see the flight test live, see the launch. They got access to the mission control room where they got a chance to talk to some folks that were working on the mission. And then, we were actually able to use some of the data from the flight test, some altered data from the flight test and actually run it on the students' apps. And, it was great to see because the flight test ended up actually exceeding, I think the height for the test, the launch itself for the elevation of that, that AA-2 actually went to. So, we were actually able to see that on the students' apps. So, it was really cool. They did an excellent job. And, like I said, we've used that model and expanded on it a little bit to offer this year's challenge.  Host: What a cool thing. Not only do you get to actually participate in some of this stuff. But I bet you that you had a bunch of eyes lighting up just walking around mission control and actually seeing the Ascent Abort-2 mission, seeing a rocket go off the pad. That must have been such an incredible experience. There was something, I know, I have here called the Culminating Event. Was that, was that it when they actually went to go see it or am I thinking about something else here?  Jamie Semple: No. You got it. That's exactly it. The Culminating Event was five days. And, the students went on VIP tours. They got to present to NASA leaderships. And, we really just had a great time getting them immersed in the NASA culture. They also had the opportunity to present to the general public. So, after the flight test, there's a time for community engagement and outreach. And, they were able to talk to people of all ages and share some of their experiences. This year we're looking to do the same thing. Like I said, the challenge starts on September 30th, it'll actually wrap up on November 18th, with student team video submissions. So, the teams actually don't submit their apps. They actually show a similar video and they post it to YouTube for our teams to review. And, we just obviously, are looking at the video and going through the app requirements. And, then based off of review of those videos, we'll down select interviews. That's where a smaller group of selected teams, we'll actually interview with the SCaN and ADC teams. So, that's a chance to actually talk to the people working for SCaN and learn a little bit more about the team and the app that they've created. After that, we will down select again. We might take one, we might take two or more teams. But those will be our top teams for our Culminating Event. Right now, we're looking at February 2021 for our Culminating Event, that hopefully, will be at a NASA Field Center. But, if not, if we have to do some sort of virtual student symposium, we will definitely do that. But we definitely want to highlight obviously, the students and their work, and that Culminating Event does that.  Host: Now this, yeah, we're still, some uncertainty here with COVID-19. But I'm sure, you know, if we have the COVID, if we have the Culminating, or sorry, the kickoff event, my apologies, coming up here in just a few days, September 30th. I'm assuming, you know, you're going to have students from, is it all over the United States? And, then would they be paired in teams across the United States, so all this work will be done virtually, I guess, for the Fall period of 2020?  Jamie Semple: Yeah. So, teams can be from the same school, different schools. We really have opened it up to formal and informal U.S. educational organizations. So, that really means across the nation, but could potentially mean internationally, if it's like a military base overseas, a school that wants to participate. Science centers can participate. So, you can actually form a team with students from different schools. And, the team is registered by a lead teacher. It has to be a certified and practicing K through 12 educator. But, once the teams are formed, then they can go ahead and obviously start working on developing their app. It's going to be interesting to see how they do that. This challenge is very well set up to be a virtual challenge. They can post their apps online, obviously, and share those from different resources. Most of the software that they're going to use will be online. We don't require them to have a specific operating system or use specific coding language. They determine all that. So, they can find out who has strengths in different areas, and they'd formulate their team that way. So, it's really an open ended and, in regards to what we require. But the main focus here is it's all a student led challenge. And, as students begin to navigate how to build that app, we'll provide those resources and suggestions and different presentations during those live virtual connections. So, we're looking forward to see, you know, obviously how this second year of the challenge goes. We're very excited it ties directly into Artemis. And, more specifically, these students are going to contribute to future mission planning. So that, these apps could actually help the SCaN team train new staff members on, you know, what's the best route for exploration on the Moon. But the main thing is when our astronauts get to the South Pole of the Moon, they need to be safe, they need to be able to communicate with Earth. And, this app brings all those things into play. They will visualize the Moon South Pole region. But they also have to do two additional things. They actually have to plot a path for explorations. So, the astronauts are not always going to land in the place that they're going to explore. So, there's a landing site and we have a destination site. And, they have to plot that path for exploration. And, then the last thing they have to do is they have, actually have to identify ten communication link checkpoints, so places that we can maintain that communication with Earth. So, a very exciting challenge. We're looking forward to getting things rolling on September 30th.  Host: Maps, adventures, communication, what a cool way to participate in returning humans to the Moon. Very, very cool. We'll make sure to put this information about the kickoff event at the very top. For those who are listening and thinking “oh man this is really cool,” we'll have some links and some information in our show notes here where you can go and explore these. So that's just one example of the many things going on in STEM Engagement. This is the App Development Challenge. Mike, I know you're the lead for something called NASA WEAR, the NASA WEAR Challenge. Can you, can you talk a little bit more about that?  Mike McGlone: Yeah. I'd love to. NASA WEAR and believe it or not, that's not an acronym, even though the word NASA is, this one is not an acronym.  Host: Gasp. [Laughter]  Mike McGlone: But we have a challenge very similar in set up to the App Development Challenge that Jamie just talked about. But we have a totally different focus in what we're working on. When our astronauts go into deep space, and we define deep space as anything, really beyond low-Earth orbit, which is where the International Space Station is at. As you go beyond, as you go beyond that low-Earth orbit, you leave Earth's atmosphere, you get beyond or into the much weaker parts of Earth's, magnetosphere. So, we don't get protection from radiation, especially the radiation that's coming from our, from the sun, what we call solar particle events. It's constantly coming, but there's also these larger, makes the explosions, radiation from the sun. You know, you hear about solar flares or coronal mass ejections. That's what one of the outcomes of that is, a lot more radiation from space. And, the human body is very much susceptible to that. And, it's, and it's not good. So that's one of the key hazards that astronauts face going on deep missions back to the Moon or on to Mars. And, in spacecraft design, you know, they did their best to harden the spacecraft to protect the astronauts. But, these larger events, they need more protection. So, we partnered with a group here at Johnson Space Center, the RadWorks Team, who also has team members at Glenn Research Center, in Cleveland, Ohio and Langley Research Center, in Hampton, Virginia, that look at wearable technology that the astronauts could dawn during these large events to provide more protection. Then that's where we got the name NASA WEAR. So, what we were asking students to do, and again, we're focused on middle and high school teams. So basically, grades 5 through 12, is asking them to design garments and or headgear that the astronauts could put on inside their spacecraft, to give them added protection. And, of course to do that, they have to understand what kind of materials are good for protecting against radiation. You know, while it might be nice to have a lead suit, you really can't put that on a spacecraft. It weighs too much. So, what are some lightweight materials that protect you well. They have to, you know, learn about some material science, you have to learn about radiation. And, then they have to get into design process to what would be the best design to protect the human body? And, we're looking at the upper torso, basically the blood forming organs in the upper torso and the head, that's where the headgear comes in with the brain and especially the eyes. So, that's what we challenge students to do. We give them several weeks to learn about that. We work with our RadWorks partners that are at Langley that are a group of material scientists and space scientists there, space physicists that we share with the students. You know, what they're working against in terms of the radiation, talk about human factors. You know, you may put this thing on, but you still got to fly that spacecraft, you still got to do all the things that you got to do to remain safe, keep everything operational. So, you got to be able to move. You got to be able to do all those kinds of things, you know, we talk about protecting the eyes. But you still got to have vision to look at the dials, so to find switches, find things in the spacecraft. So, finding the best materials and how to put that together. And, then we allow them to submit their design process. We select those, ask them to build a low fidelity prototype, low fidelity in that we know they're not going to have all the materials available, you know, in that middle school or high school or even find at home that would be the real thing that we'd use on a mission. But they get to use a good facsimile of the material to design what their prototype will look like. And, then we put it in front of that team from RadWorks and other NASA scientists and engineers and we have them actually present their findings. You know, this is what our, this is why we did this design, this is how it works. And the folks at RadWorks have actually taken some of those design ideas and put them into some of the new prototypes that they're working on. So, the students, in our first go around is, we're in our second year now, but our first go around actually, some of the ideas, like I said, the team has used. They did 3D printing, they did, they used water, these, all sorts of things that the team had not thought of or even some things they had thought of but hadn't had time to investigate. They love the ideas that the students came up with. So, that's the gist of what we're working on is wearable technologies.  Host: Yeah. Like, very fancy space fashion, almost, wearing, you know, headgear and I'm thinking like plated armor. But, I'm sure, I'm sure the students came up with some really, really unique ideas there.  Mike McGlone: They really did. The first year we really focused on just the garment. And, we had students that did biomimicry, they used ideas from nature to come up with one. We had one that did a, the name has skipped me, but basically, it's an African aardvark that's got these, like you said, plates, almost look like armor, they mimicked that. We had those that used ancient, I mean like medieval armor ideas, chain mail, but they did printing 3D using polyethylene, you know, plastic that were interchangeable to actually provide that kind of protection that we're looking for. So, they really came up with some great ideas. And, we did it again this year, the activity and this is the year that we added the headgear. And, I'm looking forward to seeing what they do. Because we're still in the middle of wrapping it up for this year. We just earlier, just selected our final teams for our Culminating Event.  Host: Oh wow, that's a big deal. Yeah, you're going to see some really cool ideas hopefully there. That's amazing. Another example of coming up with unique, unique ways of solving these challenges. I love the 3D printed chain mail idea. That's so cool, instead of shipping something up, you just print it one piece at a time and maybe come up with something, something that can help you out. Very, very cool.  Mike McGlone: Yeah. That was actually something that hadn't been discussed. You know, they had limits on what they could, how much weight of course, that they could use. They gave them a 50-pound maximum for the, for what they could send up. But yeah, the 3D printing, that was one of the first things that the RadWorks folks said is, “hey this is, it's fixable.” You know, either you could print new, new scales if you need them or, it's there because we do have 3D printing capabilities in space. So at least we have hopefully when we go on future missions. So yeah there's so many things that go into this. And, the human factors, it's amazing to me. This is, in a way kind of a set crowd sourcing, using the design process, using students as the idea generators. And, it's really the amazing, different ways that they think and all the different ways that they come up with to address a problem. It's really amazing to watch.  Host: Very cool. And, you say this Culminating Event is coming up very soon. And, I'm assuming that's virtual Culminating Event. What are we, what are we looking at doing for some of the winners here?  Mike McGlone: Yeah. Most definitely. Yeah. COVID definitely had an impact on us. We were originally going to do some of what you heard the App Development Challenge did and we were able to do our first year, which was to take our top teams and have them present live at Langley Research Center to the team, the RadWorks team that works there. Unfortunately, this year, circumstances are not allowing that. So, we are going to a virtual, what we're calling a virtual student symposium, where they're still going to get to hear from NASA experts. And those are what I consider the most important part, their opportunity to present their ideas and findings to our panel of NASA experts and get that review and questions asked and really get that feedback from the experts about their designs.  Host: Very, very cool. You know, I think one of the things that really jumps out to me listening to some of these challenges is, well, the first thing that comes to mind is. Man, where were these things when I was in school? And, maybe it was just my own failure of just not looking in the right places. But, there's so many, so many different opportunities for people to participate in real space challenges and maybe get more exposure to science and engineering than they would in the typical classroom. I think one of the best things about the education field, something you guys both get to participate in, is working with students, you've got to find, have some memories of times where these students are going through these challenges and there's just something in their face, there's something in the way they say something that you can tell that this activity or process has changed them in a way that maybe they weren't considering a STEM field before, but they sure as heck are now. Jamie, I'm sure you have something that comes to mind that, just a memory of a student or maybe just an event where you saw a measurable change in someone's behavior and possibly their career path.  Jamie Semple: Yes certainly, yeah. For the Ascent Abort-2 App Challenge, we had the opportunity to actually set up before the flight test launch at one of the viewing areas. And, so the student teams actually brought their laptops, set them up. So, as everyone from NASA was coming in, these people that had worked on the projects, you know, for months and years. They're coming in, they're actually getting a chance to see, you know, what’s about to happen with the flight test. And, it was just a great opportunity for us to sit back and watch students realize that these are some of the people or the careers that they want to be a part of as they, as they go throughout, you know, their continuing education and obviously and choosing their career. So just watching the engagement and how impressed the folks were that were actually talking to students and just seeing the students light up in terms of, you know, this is, this is what they're interested in doing. And, these people are doing the exact same thing. So, that was just an awesome opportunity for both the students, and it is for us to see kind of everything come to a fruition when it comes to, you know, how we design these challenges, and the impact that we hope they have.  Host: Very cool. Now Mike, what are some of the things that we can look forward to? I'm sure, you know, we're going to keep this episode up here for a while. And, we have these challenges coming up in the very near future. So, we hope people tune in and get a chance to participate in some of those, in the near term. But Mike, some of those things coming up, coming up in the future that maybe, if they don't, if they miss this opportunity, they'll have some more, sometime down the road.  Mike McGlone: Yeah. Thank you for the question about what's coming up next. First off, NASA WEAR, we're getting ready to put together a new iteration of it for the 2020-2021 school year. So, you'll be hearing more about that soon. Keep an eye, Jamie mentioned earlier the NASA Express, which is a weekly newsletter about opportunities. So, look for that specifically. But other things that are coming up, there are lots of them. Like we mentioned earlier, there are lots of different things that are coming out. There's a new opportunity for undergraduates at the university level called SPOCS [Student Payload Opportunity with Citizen Science] that actually put experiments on the International Space Station. There are, there'll be new career opportunities around the upcoming crew launch in October. There are all sorts of things. And, even in the future there are things that are planned. Can't say too much about them yet. But always looking for those opportunities to connect to a mission and bring that excitement to the students. And, as mentioned, the best way to keep up with that is check our NASA STEM website quite often and or sign up for that NASA Express Newsletter, which will give you a weekly update of what's out there.  Host: There you go. Have the opportunities come right, right to you. Perfect. Jamie and Mike, thank you so much for coming on Houston We Have a Podcast today. What exciting challenges that we have coming up here in the near future. A lot of ways that people can engage in STEM activities even from home, depending on where you are. All these opportunities are available to people and there's a lot more coming up. We've listed a ton of resources here. So, if you didn't catch them all or you don't have a pen and paper next to you to write them all down, don't worry, we'll have all these links and notes in our, in our episode show notes. So, that's for our listeners. Jamie and Mike, thanks again for coming on Houston We Have a Podcast.  Jamie Semple: Thank you so much, Gary.  Mike McGlone: Thanks, Gary.  [ Music]  Host: Hey, thanks for sticking around. Really hope you enjoyed this conversation with Jamie and Mike. For the students and teachers, I hope you listened to the whole thing.

Welcome to the official podcast of the NASA Johnson Space Center, Episode 166, “Crew-1: The Astronauts.” I'm Gary Jordan and I'll be your host today. On this podcast we bring in the experts, scientists, engineers, astronauts, all to let you know what's going on in the world of human spaceflight. After the successful return of Bob Behnken and Doug Hurley on the SpaceX Demo-2 mission, the first operational flight called Crew-1 is launching soon, to transport crew to and from the International Space Station. Onboard, are NASA astronauts Mike Hopkins, Victor Glover, Shannon Walker, and Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency or JAXA, astronaut Soichi Noguchi. On this episode, we're going to hear from each member of the crew to learn a little more about them and their mission. These interviews were recorded just two weeks after the Demo-2 launch as part of a series of other interviews. You'll get to hear their perspective on what the Crew-1 mission is, stories of their training, more about their careers, their family, and their thoughts about the importance of the mission that they're on. So here we go. The Crew-1 astronauts Mike Hopkins, Victor Glover, Shannon Walker, and Soichi Noguchi. Enjoy.  [ Music]  Host: First up is NASA astronaut Mike Hopkins, call sign “Hopper.” Hopper is the commander of the Crew Dragon spacecraft and the Crew-1 mission. He's responsible for all phases of flight, from launch to reentry. He'll also serve as an Expedition 64 Flight Engineer aboard the station. Selected as an astronaut, NASA astronaut in 2009, Hopkins spent 166 days in space as a long duration crew member of Expeditions 37 and 38 in 2013, and 2014. And he completed two spacewalks totaling 12 hours and 58 minutes. Born in Lebanon, Missouri, Hopkins grew up on a farm outside Richland, Missouri. He has a bachelor's degree in aerospace engineering from the University of Illinois, and a master's degree in aerospace engineering from Stanford University. Before joining NASA, Hopkins was a flight test engineer with the US Air Force. Hopper describes his role in the mission and the mission itself. As a former football player, he makes comparisons between training on the field and training as an astronaut, and the importance of teams. He also talks about his family and the importance of commercial partnerships. Here's NASA astronaut Mike Hopkins.  Mike Hopkins: Hi, I'm Colonel Mike Hopkins, United States Air Force and NASA astronaut. I will be the commander on NASA and SpaceX's Crew-1 mission to the International Space Station. And that means we are going up on the Crew Dragon, the SpaceX Crew Dragon vehicle, going to launch to the International Space Station and spend a full long duration mission up there. That we're following the DM-2 mission, which just recently landed, and one of the things that has to happen before we can go up is, we have to actually look at the data from their mission. There, Bob and Doug did a test mission. And so that's really where they're verifying that the requirements of the vehicle are met. And then when we go up, we're actually going to put it through its operational paces, we're going to have a full crew of four, instead of just two, we're going to stay up for a long duration. So that means six to seven months, versus the three to four months that Bob stayed up. So that's basically the in a nutshell what we're going to be doing. It's a standard ISS mission, except we just happen to be flying on a brand-new vehicle. So, my role on the Crew Dragon itself as part of Crew-1 is the commander of the vehicle. And so essentially from all of this training that we've been going through, launch, rendezvous, docking with the space station, I'm the commander of that particular vehicle. When I get on, when we get on the space station, I just become another member of the ISS crew. And at that point, I'll be doing all of the standard roles that you would expect any crew member that's on ISS to perform, whether it be maintenance, whether it be science, whether it be doing spacewalks, or robotics operations, or anything of that nature. While on there, though, the whole time I am still responsible for the Crew-1 vehicle and making sure that it's always ready to bring us home if we have to. And then at the end of our mission, our stay on ISS, I'll command the vehicle and bring us back home and land and then at that point is all done. Well, actually, it's not all done. Believe it or not, once you get back from the mission, you have a long post flight period. You've got to go through, again, some additional experiments, testing, collection of data on you, a lot of reviews, a lot of debriefs on how the vehicle performs. So really, when we land, the mission isn't actually over. We actually spend another about six months or so going through the post flight period. You know, it's funny. Ever since I got here as a, as an astronaut and went into that initial training as an astronaut candidate, my kids, my wife have said, “you don't go to work anymore, do you? It's like, it's like, you go and just play all day.” And, and that's what it feels like when you when you come here to JSC, and you get to train. It's much more serious than that, right? I mean, it's not playing a game, it is real, it has real consequences. But at the same time, you know, I just absolutely love it, it's, you know, we've got a couple of facilities here that are incredible. We have what we call building nine, where we have the mockup of the space station inside. And so, we do a lot of our training for spaceflight in there, where you get to, you know, see the actual layout, the real dimensions of what it's like inside the space station, what the hardware is actually like. And so that is very helpful. One of the other things we do in that facility is kind of our, the last bit of training that we get to do as an entire crew, and we go through the emergency scenarios. And so, they'll put the full crew inside the mockup of the space station, and we'll go through a fire scenario, and they'll actually pump some smoke into it. And we have to react just like we're expected to react when we're onboard the space station. And so, it's the training here is very realistic. You know, obviously, we can't get rid of gravity. Even when we do things like practice our spacewalks in the Neutral Buoyancy Laboratory, the NBL, you still have the effects of gravity, but we do as good a job as you can. And quite frankly, based on my first spaceflight, we do an amazing job actually of simulating what it's really like up in space. Yeah, the VR capabilities are, are just getting better and better and better. And it's not just, yeah, it is the VR. So, we've got a dome, where we're actually able to practice robotic operations. And, and so it's like, we're looking outside the Cupola, the big window that's on the bottom of the space station, and we're, we're operating the robotic arm as we're capturing one of our supply vehicles that comes up. And it's, I mean, it's amazing. It's very realistic, if you will. We also have an opportunity, the in a VR, we call it a VR lab, and we put on the goggles. And now we're out on a spacewalk. And now, you can simulate things like, what happens if we are to actually come off of station? We don't really have a way of practicing that in the NBL, we certainly don't want to practice it up in space, when you're out on a real spacewalk. And so we do it with the VR and you practice that situation of something happened, you've come off a station, and now you've got to use your SAFER [Simplified Aid for EVA Rescue], which is a system that allows basically, it's a little jetpack that you wear with you when you go out on spacewalks. And we practice getting back to the station. And so, you definitely want to get that right. Yeah, we also have opportunity to fly in the T-38, a two-seat jet trainer, and NASA has been flying here at JSC, we've been flying those jets for a lot of years now. And it's, it's the one thing that we get to train in that's, that's real, right, where the consequences are real. When we're in a simulator, if we mess up, if we don't make the right decisions, we just reset the simulator and we try it again. In the T-38, you have to be on your game. And so it is kind of interesting, when you do head out to Ellington Field where we, where we fly the T-38's out of and when you get into the briefing room, you know, you got to go through a mental switch and say, OK, I've got to be on my game, it's got to be all about flying the T-38. I got to stop worrying about my robotics class that I that I just took, or my test that I've got tomorrow. I need to focus in on flying this T-38, because again, the consequences are real. I think the importance of training, I fall back on to, you know, I can go back to playing football, how important the training is. I can go back to my first spaceflight, how important that training is, you know, the amazing thing and I'll tie all of those actually together when I went out on my first spacewalk. And I remember being inside the airlock. And you're looking out this hatch through the vacuum of space down at the Earth going by and, and I realized that it's a place that I've been before, sort of right, and that's standing in the tunnel, getting ready to run out on the football field before a game. And it's this, it's this moment where you're crossing this threshold, you're going from this safe environment into this environment where you're laying it all out on the line. And, so having, having that experience on the ground and then being able to, to kind of feel that same type of experience when you're up in space, it definitely helps and so the training kicks in and you get outside in that, on your first spacewalk, and that can be a pretty emotional moment for you. It can be a little bit nerve wracking, but you're also very excited, right? Because this is, this is one of those events that you've dreamed about being able to go out and do. And then that's where the training kicks in. You get outside the hatch and there's the handhold, just like when you've practiced in the NBL, in the Neutral Buoyancy Lab, in the giant pool, you come out the hatch there, and there's that that same handhold. And so, then all of a sudden, it's just muscle memory, and you just start doing the job just like you did on the ground, just like when you run out on that football field. And, and you line up and you're making your reads, and you're reacting to the play, and you've done it, you know, 10, 20, 30 times in practice, now you're doing it for real, and that just makes it go that much, that much smoother, when it is the real day. We've got an incredible team from not only the trainers, but the folks that operate the facilities. The folks that, you know, when we talk about the VR lab, you know, they've created that, and they take a lot of pride in what they've done and realizing that, that they are contributing to human spaceflight. And so, just across the board, it is, you know, oftentimes it's the astronauts that, you know, that you see. It's the astronauts that are oftentimes getting interviewed like this, but it's really the hundreds and thousands of people that that are around you that that make it happen. And we couldn't do our job without them. Wow, how do you mentally prepare for spaceflight? You know, I think you just try and keep it all in perspective. Fortunately, I've got my wife and kids to help me do that. And but you know, you go through the day to day training, the day to day operations to get ready for it. And so, in that case, you don't sometimes you're not always thinking about that big picture of I'm going to space, you really focus on how does this system operate? When I take this exam next week, what do I need to study to get ready for it? And so, you get kind of caught in the, in the moment of that particular system or that particular training that you're going through. And, and so, from a mental preparation, you know, you don't, you don't necessarily have to think about it right away, right, you've got time. And, you know, I kind of, it's funny, I go back to my days at the University of Illinois when I was playing football. And you know, there's a lot of similarities, believe it or not, between playing sports like that, and doing something like this, where you're launching in the space. You know, you spend players, whether it's football, or any sport, volleyball, or basketball, or you name it, you know, you spend months and years training and practicing for that moment, for that moment when you get on the field, when you take the court, and when you walk out to the launch pad to that rocket. And so, there's a lot of similarities between those events. And so that mental preparation, if you will, that I went through, during my days on the football field, I find that that that applies now, as I'm getting ready for spaceflight. You know, I guess for me, the astronaut, the dream of becoming an astronaut, goes back to the early days of the Space Shuttle Program. I was in high school. And so at that time, you know, they used to, they used to show the launches and the missions live in the schools, and you could go into the gymnasium, and they'd have a TV up there and you could watch it all take place. And so, that's when I really started thinking about becoming an astronaut. And, you know, it's funny, I mean, a lot of times people think of the dream of being an astronaut as something that a kid would have. And I remember when my wife and I first started dating at the University of Illinois, and I told her that I wanted to be an astronaut, she laughed at me and, and kind of said, “are you serious?” But, but at the same time, she stuck with me throughout the years and as I went through multiple applications to try and become an astronaut, and you know, after 13 years of trying and, to have that dream come true is pretty amazing. My family means everything to me, it is the most important part of my life. You know, God and family and so quite frankly, if I didn't have an opportunity to fly again into space, I'm OK because I've got my family. My wife Julie, my son Ryan, my son Lucas, they, they are just such a huge part of this, of this whole endeavor. You know, I mentioned earlier that, you know, my wife Julie has known I wanted to be an astronaut from the time we first started dating back in my college days, which is quite a few years ago. But you know, she, so she's been, she's been a part of it from almost the beginning. And so, getting to share this journey with her and also our kids has made it extra special, right. It's the, it's the icing on top of the cake. And, and so without family, it just wouldn't be as meaningful. I will share this story from my last mission. And you know, my wife Julie, she says, I'm throwing her under the bus. But I think for a lot of families out there where one of the spouses is away for a long time, they can probably relate to this story. So, when I went up to the space station the first time, my boys were in freshman and seventh grade. And so, they were very busy, they were involved in sports teams, I think at one point, they had actively going five different sports teams, and they had religious education and piano lessons and my wife was working, and also working on her master's part, via the web. And so, she was, she was pretty busy. And one of the nice things about being onboard the International Space Station is you have a lot of connectivity, believe it or not with your family. And so, I was able to call just about every day, and, and so there were a few times when I would call down from the International Space Station to my wife, and you know, she'd pick up and I say, “hey, sweetie, this is this me. How are things going?” And she's like, “I don't got time.” And she would hang up because she had to get the kids somewhere to a practice or a lesson or you name it. So, it was pretty busy for her. She definitely deserves a medal from everything she had to do on that first mission. Life does go on for the families that are at home. And what you forget oftentimes is the additional stress that they're under, because of their spouse being onboard the International Space Station. And just to kind of give you a sense of what I mean by that, and kind of the understanding of what that stress can be like, when we are launching and landing, we have opportunities for the family, like for the landing, the families can be in mission control and viewing that, and we always have an astronaut that is there with them, just to kind of explain what's going on. And during the landing phase, there's always this period where we have a comm blackout. And then that can be anywhere from three, four or five minutes long. And so, I was, after I had landed, I was actually in an MCC with the families for one of the astronauts that was getting ready to return. And I never appreciated how stressful it can be, until we got to that time of the comm blackout. And you're sitting there with the families and you just kind of, you can sense it, you can feel it because there's this period where, you know, you've been hearing the comm between the crew and mission control, and then all of a sudden, there's this, there's this silence. And you don't know if everything is all right, and you can't say everything is all right, because you don't know. And you're just waiting until that comm comes back. And there's this moment in time where mission control will start calling in the blind. We call it calling in the blind and so, they'll start calling the capsule just waiting for response and then there's no response. And I just can't. I -- it's so hard to describe what it is like for the families that have to sit there and wait through those moments until they hear their loved ones again on the, on the Space to Ground comms. It is a contractual relationship, right. I mean, NASA has gone out and we have signed a contract with SpaceX, to take astronauts to the International Space Station. And so, there's that piece of the relationship that, that, I mean, it's just reality. And, and so you can't ever forget that piece. But at the same time, when you're out there on a day to day basis, and you're and you're interacting with their engineers and you're interacting with their trainers and you're interacting with the people that are actually building the rockets and building the capsule itself, now you get to kind of go beyond the contractual piece and you really get to establish the relationships, the personal relationships. And that's been extremely powerful. I mean, one of the things that I've really enjoyed about this relationship with SpaceX or working with SpaceX is, you know, we get to go on the floor, and we get to meet the guy that's building or that is welding together your spacecraft. And I think that's good for both of us, right because we get to meet him, we get to see the work that he's doing, and understand how critical that work is -- for our safety and for the success of the mission. He gets to meet us, and we get to share thoughts and, and stories and all of that and so just that that personal connection, it has been such a, I think a powerful, a powerful thing for this for this program, and it's really paid huge dividends.  Host: Next is NASA astronaut Victor Glover. Call sign, “Ike.” Ike is the pilot of the Crew Dragon spacecraft and the second in command for the mission. He's responsible for spacecraft systems and performance. He'll also be a long duration space station crew member. Selected as an astronaut in 2013. This will be Glover's first spaceflight. The California native holds a Bachelor of Science degree in general engineering, a Master of Science degree in flight test engineering, a Master of Science degree in systems engineering and a master's degree in military operational art and science. Glover is a naval aviator and was a test pilot in the F/A-18 Hornet, Super Hornet, and the EA-18G Growler aircraft. Ike has the unique perspective of being the rookie astronaut on this flight. He talks about his role and his training and goes into depth on his background, his family and his love for flying. Like Hopper, Ike also played football and made similar comparisons to working in high performance teams. In his own words, here's Victor Glover.  Victor Glover: I'm Victor Glover, NASA astronaut and pilot for the NASA Crew-1 mission to the International Space Station. Crew-1 consists of Mike Hopkins, Shannon Walker, and Soichi Noguchi, and myself and we will be flying the Crew Dragon to the International Space Station. My role on the Crew-1 mission is to first safely get us to space station, we are flying a new spacecraft, the Crew Dragon made by SpaceX. And once we get to the space station, as a member of the Expedition, we'll be conducting research, lots of scientific experiments, some of them ongoing, some of them that we'll bring up with us, and also to do spacewalks, robotic operations, outreach events, and the maintenance and upkeep of our International Space Station. Crew-1 is the designator for the first operational mission of the SpaceX Crew Dragon. So, it's a new vehicle. You currently have Demo-2 docked to the space station. That's a test mission, the final milestone to approve this vehicle for regular transportation to the International Space Station. And so, Crew-1 is the first Crew Dragon fully operational mission. And so that's the crew, the four of us, that are going to the space station, similar to a Soyuz crew with two or three folks onboard that become the other half of an Expedition. So, we'll also be a part of the Expedition on the International Space Station. Why did I become an astronaut? That goes way back. So, high school athlete, loved being a part of a small high performing team, wrestling and football. Definitely wanted to play sports in college, went to college was fortunate to wrestle in college while pursuing my engineering education. And so, that experience impacted what I thought I wanted to do as a professional. I really enjoyed engineering, academically, but I wasn't sure I was ready to just work on design. I wanted to use those designs. And so being an operator and being out doing things was important to me, my experience in athletics was important to me. And I wanted to stay a part of small, high performing teams. And so, I'd come across one of my mentors in his Navy Reserve uniform, and the idea of joining the Navy had popped up. And I actually, originally, wanted to be a Navy Seal, I mean, small, high performing teams check. And so that's what started my journey in the Navy. And I wound up deciding to go into aviation and learn to fly. And so, the love of flying, if I haven't made that clear, the level of flying and being a part of a small, very specialized high performing team that gets to do things in really interesting and challenging environments. And the astronaut corps is the epitome of that. So yeah, I was lucky I threw my hat in the ring, and they happen to need a person with my skill set. I was selected to be a part of the 2013 astronaut candidate class. And we showed up at Johnson Space Center in August of 2013. We graduated from astronaut candidate training on July 8 of 2015. And that date is significant for a couple of reasons. It was the day we got our pins, we got our astronaut pins on July 8, 2015, which is the same day the New Horizons spacecraft had completed its billions of miles journey to Pluto to take high resolution images of the surface of Pluto. And that was the first day we got a picture taken. So pretty special day. When I got assigned, my wife and I were actually on vacation. And we had some time to just talk, just the two of us about what this meant for our family, and what it meant for us individually. And so, I came up with, I guess, three perspectives or goal priorities. And so, one was to keep things simple, and to keep things flexible, and to keep stress low. And so, I think that, that is what puts me in the best position to be ready no matter what, how things change, or if they don't change to do my job in that environment. But it also helps my family to handle what's coming, given that this is the first time that we're all doing this. If we heap a bunch of expectations on to it, and things don't go according to expectation, that creates stress. And so, for us, it's keeping it really simple, asking lots of questions to our experienced crew mates and their families and to the trainers and to each other and not assuming that we know what's coming, and just making sure that we are on the same page as we learn more. So, keeping it simple, flexible and low stress, that's been my overriding goal. My oldest kid is 17, she just finished her junior year in high school. And so, you know, our launch date is going to be right around, just after school starts. So just after the beginning of her senior year, and then my landing date will be, you know, sometime, hopefully before spring break, but before the graduation, which is important. So, that's kind of the, in terms of schedule, you know, you don't want to put scheduled pressure on yourself. The spacecraft and rocket will be ready to launch when it's ready to launch. But every day we delay, that's what I'm thinking about. It's one day closer to my kids graduation and so, I would love to be here for it. But we've had a talk, and I told her if I have to, you know, watch from space, that would be pretty cool, too. It'll be memories, something for us to talk about later. But yeah, it's definitely important to be there for the family, because you know, they're going to spend so much time working with NASA to be there for us. I am surrounded by love and support. And it's humbling and overwhelming sometimes. My mother and father are so excited about this mission. I am actually amazed at how much my father keeps up with what's going on in the space station. He'll often clue me into something I didn't realize that was happening this week, because I was busy off training. And so, I'm excited that they're so excited. My grandparents are excited about being here, and that really means a lot to me. My grandfather was in the Air Force during the Korean conflict. And so, to be able to know he's going to be there and watch us launch, and to see the progress of our mission, really, it warms my heart. And then my wife and kids, the support and love they give to not just me and the crew, but to each other, knowing that they're going to have to take care of each other while we're on the space station. What does family mean? Family is, it's -- the foundation of all of this, it's the reason that I can do what I'm doing now. And so, having been in the Navy for 22 years, it's definitely been a family adventure. My wife is amazing. She's a superhero, in my opinion. I've have deployed several times in the Navy on an aircraft carrier, and we had kids every time. A different amount of kids each time, but she has been an amazing mother and support for me as well. And so, again, knowing that they're going to be there to support me, and that we'll be in touch, able to email and call and video chat, but then also, that they're so important to supporting each other through this and also having fun with it. I mean, we're going to make it fun as well. We've got some games and some books that we're going to, to read or to play together while I'm in space. Instead of just having a phone call where “hey, how was your day, how was your day?” We're going to try to do some unique thing with that time that we have, since it's so unique. But I think my family is excited. And that's exciting for me, because my goal in this entire endeavor was to make sure that it continued to be a family adventure. That they look back on this time with fondness and not as that, hey, “that was that stressful period where dad was gone a lot. And then he left for six months.” And so, I really want them to enjoy this and to and to dig into the field, their role in it was so important, which it is. Oh, wow. I mean, you wake up and you have a meal, you get handed over to the SpaceX team. And SpaceX is running the show until you come back in are recovered and given back over to NASA to fly it back to Johnson Space Center. So, when SpaceX takes over, they get you suited up and you leak check your spacesuits, and they get you out to the launch pad, you saw them driving out in the Model X's, and that was really neat. And they take you out to the elevators there, get you up into the crew access arm and help you get strapped into the vehicle. And there are some procedures to run through. And you're talking to the core, which is their version of similar to cap comm, the person that's speaking to the folks in the capsule, and that person is actually in Hawthorne. And so, you're talking to them as you run through the procedures. And they're coordinating with the flight control team there in Hawthorne, with the folks in at launch control in at Kennedy Space Center, and also with the folks in Houston, when you get to that point. And you go through some procedures on the way up to launch and then the team that helps strap you in, they get you all buttoned up and they close the hatch. And then they move out away and when everyone else is far away from the vehicle at a safe distance. That's actually when they fuel up the vehicle. And that is one of the booster, the Falcon 9 and that's probably the most unique thing about this -- system is that they feel it up with the crew sitting there. And so, we have a system, the launch escape system, which we had a test back, a really amazing test back in January and they fuel the rocket up as you're sitting there and the fueling finishes not long before liftoff. And then, and you saw the rest after that, and they lit the candle and sent Bob and Doug skyward. My overriding thought, when I envision us getting to that point, is don't screw up. [laughter] I mean, you know, we have responsibilities, things that we're watching. And then some things that we will be doing, interacting with the vehicle, and making sure that we understand what the vehicle is doing, what it's expected to do and what it's actually doing. And so, trying to stay focused on those tasks, when again, everything I do at that point will be the first time I've done it. Actually, that's, that's true for all of us. None of us will have flown this vehicle before. And so, I think trying to one, appreciate the magic and, and the accomplishment that it is to get to the first operational mission of Dragon, but to also make sure that we're focused on our responsibilities and, and flying it safely. And then once we've done that safely, I think we can look back on it, and appreciate that. But so, trying to balance that enjoying and living in the moment, but also managing the responsibilities to make sure that we get to space, to low-Earth orbit safely. I'm looking forward to that, that juxtaposition of emotion, I think. There are windows that would be down kind of near our feet. And so, our screens are up high. And I just envision, at some point, being able to like take a look down and to see the Earth from a perspective that I've never seen. I've been to 64,000 feet, that's the highest up I've ever been above the ground. And so, to get to a point beyond that, and then be able to look down at the Earth, that'll be a little special moment, but then I'll still have responsibilities, and to look back up at that display and make sure that we're on timeline. It'll be an interesting tension to manage. You know, it doesn't matter what you want to do. One of the most important things to your ability to achieve success is your understanding and definition of what success is. And so, I think some things that are just universal, are the things that I tell young folks when I go out and speak but I think it applies to us older folks as well. And I try to live these myself. And so, number one is to be gritty, g-r-i-t-t-y, to be gritty. It means not quitting. Don't give up in the face of a challenge. And the greatest challenges you'll ever experience are from within. If you can control these challenges, external challenges are no big deal. So, number one, be gritty. Number two, be a lifelong learner, learning inside and outside the classroom, learn to computer program, learn a foreign language. And once you learn one thing, master something. Learn to play an instrument, climb down that mountain and go ascend another mountain. Before long, you've amassed so many skills that your skill set might actually make you successful, but your ability to acquire skills is the thing that really is going to be so valuable to you in the future. So be gritty, be a lifelong learner. And the last one is to be a good teammate. That's hard though, because you don't get to determine if you're doing a good job. It's the people to your left and your right. But that's why it's even more important for us to focus on that because it takes the focus off of yourself. So be gritty, be a lifelong learner and be a good teammate. I don't care what you want to do, you'll be good at it.  Host: Next up is NASA astronaut Shannon Walker. Walker is a mission specialist for Crew-1. As a mission specialist, she will work closely with the commander and the pilot to monitor the vehicle during the dynamic launch and reentry phases of flight. She'll also be responsible for monitoring timelines, telemetry, and consumables. Once onboard the station, Walker will become a flight engineer for Expedition 64. Selected as a NASA astronaut in 2004, Walker launched to the International Space Station aboard the Soyuz TMA-19 spacecraft as the copilot and spent 161 days aboard the orbiting laboratory. More than 130 microgravity experiments were conducted during her stay in areas such as human research, biology and material science. A Houston native, Walker received a Bachelor of Arts degree in physics from Rice University in 1987, as well as a Master of Science degree, and a doctorate in space physics, both from Rice University in 1992 and ‘93, respectively. Walker talks about her role on the Crew-1 mission and makes comparisons to her previous experiences on the Soyuz spacecraft. She spent her whole career at NASA and recalls when she considered that she may be eligible to be an astronaut after all. Walker recalls being assigned to Crew-1 and some of the exciting activities she's looking forward to during her stay on the International Space Station. Here's Shannon Walker.  Shannon Walker: I'm Dr. Shannon Walker, NASA astronaut, getting ready to fly on the Crew-1 mission to the International Space Station. Crew-1 is the first, what we're terming, operational mission of the Crew Dragon vehicle to the International Space Station. And what we mean by operational mission is that we are starting the phase where we are flying astronauts, NASA is flying astronauts to the International Space Station on commercial crew vehicles. The Crew-1 Mission is following, what is termed the Demo-2 mission, which was a test flight of the Dragon Crew vehicle. We've been looking at the handling characteristics of the vehicle. Did it performance in space as we expected based on simulations on the ground? It does, which is very good. What our mission we'll be doing is extending some of those capabilities that they tested, and maybe testing out some new things on our way or while we're at the space station. So, my role for my upcoming flight is sort of broken into two pieces. There's my role on the Crew Dragon, and there's my role on the International Space Station. On the Crew Dragon, I am one of the Mission Specialists, and so a lot of my job, I think, is to help people understand how you operate on that spacecraft with four people as opposed to just two people like Doug and Bob flew. How you allocate the various tasks that need to be done, that make sense and can get things done efficiently with four people in a small space. On the space station, my role is going to be very much like it was last time. Do what the ground needs us to do, whether it's maintenance, or yes, I spent six months on the station previously in 2010, and I am so looking forward to getting back there and having another six months on the space station. It is so exciting to live and work onboard the space station, do all the science that we get to do, to look down on the Earth and just take in the wonders of the Earth and the universe. No, what's very interesting about your time on the space station is that every day is different. And you don't always know what you might be doing. Some of it depends on what cargo vehicles come up and what science they can fly. How do you prepare for that? Well, you do a lot of generic training, you prepare for a lot of different things. We are trained in just about every aspect that we might encounter. When I was there last time, I did a whole variety of tasks. It was at the very end of the construction of the space station. So, we did a lot of maintenance and getting the station ready to do all the science that we're doing now. And so, I think that's one of the main differences that's going to be between my last flight and this flight, it'll be more science, hopefully less maintenance. And before it was more maintenance, less science. Well, I have spent my entire career at the Johnson Space Center. I actually started out as a flight controller, working in the Space Shuttle Program. I worked with the robotic side, so I was in charge of deploying and retrieving satellites with the space shuttle. After that, I moved over into working with the space station program, working to get hardware built for the space station and working with our international partners to get hardware built for the space station. One particular notable time I had in that, in that time, was I got the opportunity to spend a year in Russia working with our Russian counterparts doing avionics integration, which was really interesting, really neat experience. Following that, I went back to the control center, but I had a very different job there. I worked with and eventually ran the group that was responsible for the technical health of the space station. And when you say technical health, people sometimes wonder what that means. I think the best analogy is, we were the problem solvers when things went wrong. If you've seen the movie, Apollo 13, when they said, “you need to take a round one of these to fit a square one of those.” That's kind of what we did on a day to day basis. Yes, I always wanted to be an astronaut. I was about four years, yes, I just turned four, when we first landed on the Moon. And I have very distinct memory of my parents taking me and my older sister out into the backyard. And the Moon was rising over our house and they pointed up there and said, “we have people there.” And even at four, I thought that just sounded like the best idea ever. Yeah, it was kind of difficult growing up, because even though I knew I wanted to be an astronaut, I didn't know what it took to become an astronaut. And so, I knew that I needed to do well in school, sort of basic things like that. But it wasn't really until I got quite a bit older, then I realized that I actually did or would have the qualifications to be an astronaut. Most people have a lot more capability than they give themselves credit for. And so, when I realized that I had, well, I had seen a new class of astronauts that had been hired for the space shuttle and I was reading in the newspaper, what their qualifications were and just going through some of them, I realized I can do that. And that was a big turning point from not -- not understanding what it took to be an astronaut, to really that day sitting on the couch knowing, yes, I can do that. Mentors and heroes. I guess, I really have to give a lot of credit to my parents. If you think back to when I was first looking at people going to the Moon, it was exclusively military test pilots. And to their credit, they never said to me, girls can't do that. And so, sort of being blissfully unaware that it, at that time wasn't an option. Of course, by the time I was old enough to be an astronaut, everything had changed. But just, my parents having high expectations growing up, really fit into me being an astronaut. As a kid, I was always interested in math and science. And honestly, aside from not knowing how to be an astronaut, I knew it wasn't something I could do immediately. So, I didn't know which path I wanted my career to take. And I figured physics was a nice, generic field in some sense that I could go any direction after I graduated from school. Later in life, when I went to graduate school, I studied planetary science. And so, I definitely had a fork in the road, at one point. Do I want to go do a be a planetary scientist, or do I want to continue to participate in the human spaceflight program? All NASA. I think it had -- growing up in Houston had a huge impact on my life. Because the Human Spaceflight Center, the Johnson Space Center was here. It was in my backyard. And so, it always had a presence there. I remember coming out as a kid and taking a tour and things like that. So, it was always there and inspiring to me. My time in Russia was so interesting and so fascinating. What I look back on is the personal connections that I had with my fellow engineers, and colleagues over there. What I have found being part of the International Space Station Program, and not just Russia, but our colleagues in Japan, and Europe and Canada is that, underneath it all, we all have the same goals, and we all have the same passions, and people are just driven to accomplish this joint goal that we have together. How’s my Russian language? I used to be a lot better than it is now. Russian is not an easy language. I would say for a non-native speaker, it takes a lot of effort to keep up it's sort of a what we would call a perishable skill. And as of late, I have not had that opportunity. So, I can probably sit in class or I can sit in class and listen to all the technical information that I need to understand that, but then having a conversation is not going to go very smoothly these days. I was assigned quite late to this mission. And so, my training time has been much, much shorter than the rest of my crewmates. Oh, it was very, very exciting because I wasn't expecting it. My ground duty within the astronaut office was being as part of the leadership team in the astronaut office. So, I was more of a management type, and then all of a sudden, Friday, I was a manager, Monday, I was a crew in training. And so, it's a huge shift in how your day goes. So, typical training week. I don't think there are typical training weeks. Every week is different, every day is varied. And we usually have a mix of space station training as well as Crew Dragon training. And so, sometimes we have, also we have training with our international partners, which is a nice challenge in this environment. Yeah, the kinds of things that we train for this mission, everything from how to handle emergencies on the space station to how you fly the Crew Dragon spacecraft, to how you do a variety of experiments. Well, there are a few differences in training between training on the Soyuz flight and training for the Crew Dragon flight. One, on the Soyuz, I was trained as the pilot on that spacecraft. And so, I had a lot more hands on flying the spacecraft training. I'm not the pilot on this particular flight, so I do not have to train for those duties. And the other big difference is, now the training is English and before it was in the Russian language. Oh, I'm looking forward to being on station, living and working there, and just spending time with my crewmates on the station. There's so many things that make living on the space station special. You are in a pretty small environment, although the station is quite large by many respects, but you're with a set group of people for a long period of time, and so you really get to know each other so much better than you have been able to on the ground. We're already a family but then, as so many people can relate to being in one place with your family for extended periods of time, is it's just different. There are so many things that you could do on station. What I like about it is every day really is different. You get up, and you do something different, and you may be doing a biological experiment one day, you may be doing maintenance on equipment the next day. And then the day following that, you'll be doing some sort of experiment in chemistry. And so just being able to participate in so many different thing, I find exciting.  Host: Last but not least, we have JAXA astronaut, Soichi Noguchi. Noguchi will also be a mission specialist for Crew-1 like Shannon Walker, working with commander and the pilot to monitor the vehicle during the dynamic launch, and reentry phases of flight and keeping watch on timelines, telemetry and, consumables. Noguchi will also become a long duration crew member aboard the space station. He was selected as an astronaut candidate by the National Space Development Agency of Japan, NSDA, currently the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency, JAXA, in May of 1996. Noguchi is a veteran of two spaceflights, one on the space shuttle and another on a Russian Soyuz. During STS-114 in 2005, Noguchi became the first Japanese astronaut to perform a spacewalk outside of the space station. He performed a total of three spacewalks during the mission, accumulating 20 hours and five minutes of spacewalking time. He launched aboard a Soyuz spacecraft in 2009 to return to the station as a long duration crew member. Noguchi has a unique perspective on flying on both the shuttle and the Soyuz to the International Space Station. Noguchi recalls his previous experiences and what he's looking forward to, taking a third spacecraft to the orbiting laboratory. Noguchi discusses his training, his family, the importance of science on station, and the importance of international collaboration. Here's Soichi Noguchi.  Soichi Noguchi: Hi, my name is Soichi Noguchi from Japan. I am Mission Specialist One on Crew-1 mission to International Space Station. Well, our mission will be help support commander and the pilot on spacecraft, Crew Dragon. And of course, once I arrive on the space station, I'll be a board engineer and do lots of science and maintenance and spacewalks, robotics, all kinds of work. Well, I'm really fortunate enough to have good crew member. Hopper is our commander. He's a really natural leader, he's really thoughtful and caring, and really fortunate to have great commander like him. Ike, I would say, he's the best rookie ever. I don't know any other rookie astronaut who is really capable and knowledgeable. And a fun guy as well. Shannon Walker, we spent a long, long time together. We're in the same age. And I really respect her on her knowledge. She's really ISS guru. And for me, it's more like a running mate. Because we are space specialists, Mission Specialist. I'm Mission Specialist One and she's Mission Specialists Two and together we can share the knowledge and kind of backup each other to accomplish big mission goals. So, we're very happy to interact with each other. So, four of us, the great team, and obviously we have a lot of a different background. And the diversity definitely gives us a great rigidity to our crew. Yeah, I was fortunate enough to fly two different vehicles so far; a space shuttle and Russian Soyuz. And this new SpaceX is obviously launched like a capsule. This is more like Soyuz. And the docking sequences is quite resembling to the space shuttle. And landing is totally new, and so, we're going to be splashing down into the ocean, just like Apollo. So, it's a little bit of a different flavor. It's a combination of all the space vehicle, which mankind developed so far. So, it's very exciting. My first flight was 2005. That was on the Space Shuttle Discovery, STS- 114 and that was two weeks flight. And we have five-year training for the next flight. And my flight was 2009, end of 2009. That was on the Russian Soyuz and was launched from Baikonur. So, it's roughly five years between those flights. My Soyuz flight, it last about five and a half months. I launched the day before Christmas and I come back a few days before the, few days after June, so yeah, roughly six months. And so, I did three spacewalks back in 2005. Oh yeah, by all means, I'd be happy to open the hatch and go outside and have fun for six hours, and don't want to come back actually. Wow, spacewalk is fun, period. A lot of people ask me for the spacewalk, is it dangerous? Is any risk and yes, of course, there's a risk involved. It's a high-risk environment and adrenaline rush type of activities. But we definitely enjoyed, everything flows, but it's really slow. And the view is just magnificent. It's nothing between you and Earth and just an open space. And we can definitely enjoy the view. And also, all the tasks, we train for many, many times on the ground, usually under the pool. So, you, by the time you do the spacewalk, you know, all the tasks by heart. So, it's actually very enjoyable. And it's very fun. And I'm really looking forward to go back and do the spacewalk. As my lovely wife and three daughters and they are now in Japan, of course, in this situation, COVID-19, they are not freely come to, to here and I don't have much chance to go back to Japan. So that's kind of separation. So that's one tough situation for me. But we will be, we will be together, although we are physically separated. Yes. My kids are fortunate enough to attend my two previous launches. The first time on the space shuttle, they're elementary school, and they just enjoy traveling to Florida, aside from the rocket launch, and on my Soyuz launch, they are almost teenagers. And they can understand all those anxiety and the feeling of the rush and the feeling of excitement. So, it's second time is more memorable. Hopefully this time, they're now grown up. But they're still very happy to come to see their dad launch, so should be a nice family reunion. Yeah, it's actually, those three flights are so far apart. The 2005, our main way of communication was a, is a fax actually. And then we just started to have some very limited email. On the second flight, however, we have internet onboard. We can do the tweet, we can do the video conferencing. And now, we have almost a 24/7 email access plus video conferencing capability on their cell phone as well. So, it's much closer in this digital age. So, it should be, should be a fun stay. Yeah, I think that's the one good thing about the digital evolution. So obviously, as the technology evolves, it's much easier to communicate and it's convenient for them as well. Before, I remember on my first flight, my family had to come to the Space Center, to hear all those conversation. And second time, because it's Russia, there's somewhat limited. Now everything, you can stream it on their cell phone and emails, pretty much stress free. So, definitely the IT advances is doing a big favor for us for the family communication between space and Earth. Right now, our training is basically two parts. One is lots of training as the ISS long expedition crew member, which involves science payloads, and also the maintenance task and also some of the assembly tasks remaining on the space station. The other half is of course, the SpaceX, we are learning to fly the new vehicle. As a long duration crew member, you have to know not just the U.S. module, but all those each international partners modules. Russian module, Japanese module, European module and of course, the Canadian arm. So a lot of maintenance and also safety related events are, we have to know and especially for the emergency type of scenario, you know the depressurization, fire, and toxic atmosphere, those kind of things you have to memorize and you have to act as one team to counteract with the situation and those type of emergency response training, we take a lot of time and that's a good team building opportunity as well. Well, I think having a two different experience so far definitely helps understanding the new system and the space shuttle and so, is obviously two totally different system, totally different designed spacecraft. And I kind of feel the similar approach on for like launch and launch escape is somewhat similar to what the Soyuz guys doing and rendezvous approach and the way they dock is, I feel the same philosophy as the space shuttle. And, but the important thing is, this is brand new, designed from scratch, 21st century spacecraft. So, I have knowledge of space shuttle and the Soyuz, but I don't want to stick to those old experience. We are learning a new system, and this is a new design. And obviously, the SpaceX did a very nice job designing the new spacecraft. I think this SpaceX training, obviously this is new. So, I would say that more like a half development support and half training. So, unlike space shuttle program or Soyuz, which have a long history of a safe flight and, and I kind of learn from the previous crew member. But this one, you have to kind of build the training template by ourselves and half of the time I spend in house in California is more like helping them develop the procedure. So, it's a kind of new experience. But eventually this SpaceX Crew Dragon become a standard. And we will learn from their system, from their operating side. So, I think eventually this will become a new standard. The shuttle training here in Houston, and the Soyuz training in Star City, Russia, which is a totally different approach, I personally like the way that NASA trained me on the first flight, but the Russian side, they train me from the scratch and start from the theoretical part, then can build up to the operational skills, while space shuttle you learn through the simulation and learn from the other crew member. So, it's a totally different approach. And SpaceX has its own way. And, but each, different method eventually make us a good astronaut who can operate the system safely because our ultimate goal is return the vehicle with the same number of people go up and they come back safely. So, well, many people say, especially the returning crew, they feel like they never missed a date on space station, meaning, they on the day one of the returning flight, they feel like they were on the station yesterday as well. Meaning, you quickly go back to the old habits of going back to the zero-gravity life and the stuff from there. So, my second flight, first flight was on the shuttle. And then the second flight was Soyuz, so it's totally different, the launch experience, but by the time I opened the door, open the hatch of the space station, I feel like I was living here for a long, long time. Yeah, during my stay, we have a space shuttle, STS-130 came up and then installed the Cupola. That was quite a game changer. Before that, we have a smaller window and everyone's kind of cram in the flight, for the view. And now we have a big, big window and seven windows and a lot of astronauts just glued to the window and take photos and videos and do the video conference with the family. So, that was quickly changed our quality of space station life. One of the fun moments is, on my first flight, I flew with Steve Robinson, he was EVA, together. So, it's a good friend on the space shuttle. And he comes to the space station with the Cupola. So, we opened the window. And then he picked up the guitar and he played a song for us. So, that's a great moment that we have, enjoyed the time together. Together we will overcome all the obstacles. All for one, Crew-1 for all. The important thing for us is of course, to keep the dream alive. And for this commercial space program, is obviously Launch America. This commercial program is by the American for the Americans of the Americans. So, Americans really should be proud of this achievement. But for the rest of the 7.4 billion people, I will open the door for you. The spacecraft of this century is not just for America, but this is international cooperation and all the other people around the world have a chance to ride on this Crew Dragon. So, this is a new era. This Launch America is a great achievement for the American company, and of course, NASA played a big role. But this achievement benefits the whole world because the International Space Station itself is an international program. And there are a lot of companies that are looking forward to be the second or third SpaceX. Meaning, any country around the world, now have a chance at least to give it a try. They can have their own vehicle certified by NASA and bring people to the space station or beyond. So, this is definitely a new era, opened up the new capability and possibility.

                        "description": "Gary Jordan (Host): Houston, we have a podcast. Welcome to the official podcast of the NASA Johnson Space Center, Episode 168, “Expedition 1.” I'm Gary Jordan, and I'll be your host today. On this podcast, we bring in the experts, scientists, engineers, astronauts, all to let you know what's going on in the world of human spaceflight. Twenty years ago, on November 2nd, 2000, a crew of three spacefarers arrived at the International Space Station with a mission to bring the new orbital complex to life. We call these missions Expeditions, and the crew was Expedition 1. The trio was NASA's William Shepherd commander of Expedition 1, and Russian cosmonaut Sergei Krikalev and Yuri Gidzenko. Both seasoned veterans of long duration missions aboard the Russian Space Station Mir that was in orbit. These three spent 136 days aboard the space station and set the course for what would be an unbroken streak of human presence in space. We like to tout often that if you're, I guess, at this point, younger than 20, you've never lived in a world where there haven't been humans in space at any given point in your life. To get to that point where humans started inhabiting the space station was not an easy thing. So, to tell the full story of Expedition 1, we have William Shepherd, goes by Shep. He was a manager of the space station program, a seasoned veteran in space, and the commander of Expedition 1 to the station. We talk about what it took to get to Expedition 1, the mission itself, and how the space station has grown into what it is today. So, here we go. Expedition 1 with Bill Shepherd. Enjoy.  [ Music]  Host: Shep, thanks for coming on Houston We Have a Podcast today. Appreciate your time.  Bill Shepherd: Yeah, happy to be with you, all my friends at NASA there.  Host: And I wanted to start with this, we're taking a snapshot here. Look where we are 20 years past when you first arrived on the International Space Station and set the course for continuous human presence. What are your initial thoughts right off the bat of achieving this milestone?  Bill Shepherd: Well, I'm kind of amazed that between NASA and all the international partners that we -- frankly, that we've got it done. Many, many people at the outset of the International Space Station Program decided it was mission impossible, and it was never going to happen, but the team has proved them wrong.  Host: Well, that's perfect. Well, let's take a deep dive then. I feel like you're the perfect person to talk to about this, just diving into exactly that. What were those obstacles that made it seem like mission impossible? So, let's start with the landscape of NASA and the international partnerships in the early '90s, when we were just kind of getting the International Space Station Program and the thought of what would be the International Space Station up and running.  Bill Shepherd: Well, the idea for a space station is not at all new. Certainly, even before World War II, people were talking about humans traveling in space and what we would do there. You know, I think von Braun had many sketches. There are Walt Disney shows on rockets going to space stations, but really it got off the ground, if you will, both in the U.S. and in the Soviet Union with manned laboratories. We had Skylab, and then the Russians had a number of Salyut space stations and then eventually one that they called Mir. President Reagan started Space Station Freedom, and this was in the early -- in the middle of '80s. And by 1992, the administrations had changed, and the problem was that NASA had spent almost $11 billion on Space Station Freedom, and it taken eight years. And not one pound of flight hardware was to show for it. And so, Congress was really upset with the space agency and was getting ready to cancel the program. And so, really ISS, the International Space Station Program was a big change that pulled the iron out of the fire and reorganized things. And that's kind of the path that we started on 20 years ago, and that's where we are today.  Host: Well, let's talk about some of those original plans. You mentioned Space Station Freedom. There were a number of other space stations that were actually flying at that time, Mir included. Let's take a dive into the Shuttle program and the original plans for shuttle as a vehicle to construct things like space stations.  Bill Shepherd: Well, NASA Space shuttle was actually something that NASA was promoting even before the end of the Apollo missions. I think John Young was on the Moon talking about what a great thing a space shuttle would be and encouraging the politicians to support it. But one of the purposes of the shuttle was to be able to build large things in Earth orbit. So, besides carrying astronauts to space and doing experiments and EVAs and robotics and whatnot, one of the main reasons why we needed a space shuttle was so we could build big stuff in orbit. And it was kind of in competition with the Russians. We didn't know what the Russians were going to do. They eventually built their own space shuttle and flew it one time. But that was the landscape. And I think, you know, to me, there was a lot of celebration and ceremony around the retiring of the shuttles and the ones that got transported to the museums. But for me, that was a really sad series of days because this was the end of at least United States astronauts launching, flying into space, and coming back in a vehicle that had wings on it that could land like an airplane. And I still think that's a tremendous capability, and we've pretty much given that up.  Host: Yeah and think about what it accomplished. You know, even before the International Space Station launched its first element, we did have cooperation with this space station that you're talking about, Mir, the Russian space station, where we had an opportunity to work together with Russia doing the shuttle Mir program. And not only, you know, using the shuttle, but also understanding the operations, I guess, behind long-duration spaceflight on Mir.  Bill Shepherd: Absolutely, if you look back to even President Kennedy in the earliest days of our human spaceflight effort, talked about the political and diplomatic benefits of working with the Soviets on space. And Apollo/Soyuz in 1975, was a result of that. And it took us a while after that, another two decades, to really get close to the Russian Federation and work together on space station. But I think it's a very healthy thing for NASA and for the country to be doing.  Host: We'll talk about those years. I think around this time, you were the International Space Station Program manager. You had a lot of oversight into, you know, this cooperation, U.S. and Russia, to go from this idea of freedom, International Space Station -- or Space Station Freedom to this cooperative International Space Station. Can you talk about some of those years?  Bill Shepherd: Well, my original assignment from the NASA administrator was to be on a -- basically a study team that would look at what is the, what's the executability, if you will, the Freedom Program? And if it needed to look like something else, what would that be? And I had -- I was a member of about a 10-men team, and we studied that for about a month and made recommendations. This was all being driven by directives from the Clinton Administration to figure out what was NASA's future with the Freedom Program and what were they going to do? After the study was over, then I was the program manager, basically handling several changes to what NASA was doing. One was, we were bringing the Russian Federation into the International Space Station partnership, which is a big deal. The partnership had been formed about six years earlier by international agreements with the Canadian Space Agency, the European Space Agency, and the -- there were other involvements with -- there is some involvement with the Italian Aerospace Industry. But that group was already up and running, and was initially very opposed to bringing yet another partner in because, in part, this would diminish everybody's availability for astronauts and research time on space, electrical power, and, you know, all those things that you've got to do to have a collaborative Expedition or environment up in orbit. So, there was a lot of negativity among the established partners to bring the Russians in. The Russians themselves were very difficult to deal with. And not because they are or were bad people, but you have to look at space from a Russian standpoint. They launched the first satellite into space. They had the first man to fly in space. They had the first woman to fly in space. They did the first spacewalk. They were the first to look at the backside of the Moon. There're quite a number of technological firsts that the Russians claim. And they -- to their -- from their point of view, they looked at the United States, us Americans, as coming in behind their successes and trying to take some of the credit for it. And I think there's some merit to that. I mean, we certainly approached doing space from different directions, technically, but Russians are very proud. They've got a very strong legacy in the early days of humans in space. And I think initially, we did not -- the Americans in particular, we did not respect that or appreciate that maybe as strongly as we might have. And that was -- you know, getting that -- getting behind that -- passed that was a big deal. In addition, there's several other things that were happening. One was the budget for the space station, whatever it was going to be called at that time, was quite constrained. The design of Freedom had to be changed for a number of reasons. It was too expensive. The assembly of the components had a lot of risk in it that we wanted to take out. We had Russian components that we had to integrate. We had this partnership that we had to manage. And we had a complete restructuring of the Space Station Program on the U.S. side altogether. NASA had written four prime contracts to various companies in the United States to carry out Freedom. And this was in the process of being condensed to a single prime contract. Some of the contractors were not going to maintain the work contents that they had originally won in the previous contract. They were unhappy about that. And in addition, the Space Station Program was going to be headquartered at one particular place in the country. And there was a lot of arm wrestling about where and which center or entity was going to be in charge of that and it ended up being Houston. I was very happy about that because I was living in Houston. But these were some of the dynamics that were going on at the time. Very respected Japanese partner who was in a lot of these discussions of the initial International Space Station partnership came up to me one day, and he said, Shep, since 1990, early 1993, he said, “Shep, you guys are doing your six redesign of the space station. You're changing the contract around. You're chopping pieces of the hardware off. You're running short on money. And you're changing the contract all around, and you're moving the headquarters to Houston. I don't think you're going to make it.” And that was -- he was a pretty seasoned guy. And that was his expert opinion in the middle of 1993. And so, I didn't say anything to him. I didn't want to be disrespectful, but I thought to myself, I thought, you know, we've got a real legacy of how to do hard things at NASA. They've got a great team working on this and just standby. We're going to show you that this can get done.  Host: Shep, there seemed to be just insurmountable odds against actually making this thing work. So, how did you navigate through all of these obstacles? What -- how did you integrate with the international partners, with Russia to actually make the International Space Station become a thing?  Bill Shepherd: Well, I don't think it's a simple answer, and I think a lot of people own parts of that story. I do think that one of the things that was really important was I stepped down from being a program manager because I -- the program manager has a lot of responsibilities to do. A lot of the Congressional liaison kept the funding for the program headed in the right direction, handholding for a lot of higher-level forums. And I wanted to do the -- more focused on the technical work. So, I was like what -- took on the role as a deputy program manager to do that. But that said, we started having pretty aggressive exchanges, groups of people in Moscow, talking to our Russian counterparts and having Russians in Houston. And I think that was really the thing that made the International Space Station Program go. The Russians came and certainly did things differently than what we did. But in the end, the design and how it was implemented added a lot of capability to the station. And I'm probably jumping ahead, we can talk about this later in the podcast, but nobody at the time realized that how important having multiple countries and multiple launch assets that could support the station in orbit. And after we've had, particularly the Columbia disaster, we would not have a space station if the Russians were not able to fly crews and material up to the ISS. And I don't think we specifically foresaw that in 1993. But the fact that many countries, the Europeans, the Japanese, and the Russians, in particular, could have an opportunity to launch to the station on their own, that was a big part of our design. So, the station has, even as a program, that had a lot of moving parts. It's hard to cover it all. In a short discussion.  Host: Well, we can zoom in on hardware because I think one of the things you mentioned with some of the early years is, we were doing a lot of studies on designing what would be a space station but never had any hardware to show for it. So, during the space station, there were that -- there was that development process of the initial hardware of the International Space Station. I know there's components like Mir-2 and Soyuz, and I know Zarya was a joint effort. How about some of those early space station hardware designs and processes?  Bill Shepherd: But I think you have to back up one step and think about, is there a culture or a philosophy that says not only what you design, but why you design it the way you do. And that was really the most interesting thing to me. Our previous Freedom design was dependent on some early assembly flights, where we didn't have a lot of cooling, communications, electric power, other capability. And gradually the station got built out, and those utilities, if you will, became more robust. But several of the aspects of this support to keep the station alive, had, if you will, a lot of technical risks that they were going to survive the period before we had redundancy. The Russians, on the other hand, designed smaller modules. They were, in essence, all up vehicles, and when they launched it. It had life support. It had environmental control. It had fire suppression. It had computers. It had radios. It had solar power. It had thermal control, had docking mechanisms, all that stuff. So, the analogy would be to having a house that you're building in the United States or the U.S. side of the partnership. We lay the foundation, and we get the studs in and frame everything out, put the roof on, and months into the construction, you might have a place you can roll out a cot and sleep. And the Russian approach was clear the driveway, and pull the Winnebago up and, you know, open the door. And those are two really different approaches to doing, you know, human-capable facilities in orbit. And I think there's a lot of merit to the Russian approach, frankly.  Host: Yeah, it's maybe a bit simpler. So, I guess around this time, you talked about stepping down from ISS program manager. At what point did you start gearing up for training for what would be the first Expedition?  Bill Shepherd: Summer of 1996. The first crew -- it was determined by the program management talking to the space agencies in the various countries that, at that time, this is summer of '96, the launch was supposed to be 1998, somewhere. And everybody was assuming that the training was going to be a year and a half or so, maybe a little bit longer. And that was historical reference from what it would take to train shuttle crews and what the Russians normally would do for their Soyuz training. So, mid-1986, it was decided that naming a crew to go to the station would basically start driving the training folks to get their training, mature and, you know, get started with crew training. So, we got named, trying to think when it was. I believe it was sometime in the fall of 1996, and we had started our training, essentially that winter. And it turned out that due to delays in hardware and launch schedules, the crew did not end up flying until almost the end of 2000. So, our training flow was about four years, plus a little bit, about twice what we had originally intended. It was very tedious. If you're training but you don't know when you're going to fly, it's somewhat akin to crawling over broken glass once in a while. But we all understood that this was a developmental thing, and nothing was going to be perfect. And if I can say, patience had to be somewhat of a virtue.  Host: I did have the pleasure of having Kathy Bolt on this podcast to talk about training and how it's evolved over time. And she did mention training the Expedition 1 crew, and one of the things she mentioned -- when you talked about it being tedious, one of the things she mentioned was there was this idea to train you to the system level, to train you to know that the whole International Space Station inside and out, how to switch all the buttons and how everything worked. And that training evolved over time to a more general approach, since the space station, for the most part, could be controlled from the ground. Did you know -- did you find that some of those -- some of that tedious training was just knowing like every system on the space station inside and out?  Bill Shepherd: Well, I want to commend Kathy and all the people who worked on Expedition 1 in particular. They did a great job training us. But I think the reality of it was, we were not the easiest crew to train, and that was true for a couple of reasons. One was, particularly Sergei Krikalev, who was an Energia engineer, and he was basically our flight engineer onboard. Both he and I had been intimately involved in Mir-2, and all the nuts and bolts of the U.S. side of the ISS program. So, we knew a lot about the hardware. And so, the other thing was, we knew when we flew that, although the ideal case was that the ground could do everything, the reality was that they were not going to be able to. Because particularly early in our flight, we only had direct communications, line of sight, from orbit to the ground, and we had to have a ground station relay all the comm to Houston or Moscow. So, this meant that our coverage was not going to be anything like what we have now on ISS or what we were used to on a space shuttle with the TDRSS relay satellite. So, we had periods -- we were going to have periods on orbit, sometimes four to six hours long, where we weren't talking anybody and nobody on the ground could see what was happening on ISS. So, with that in mind, you got to step back and say, well, am I going to wait for the ground to tell me what to do when something big is up? Or am I going to figure out what I have to do in the interim and try and, you know, prevent it from getting worse or fix it or make it better? So, we were pretty hard over that the right way for us to train as the first crew and probably the early crews up there was to know as much as we could about everything. Because the chances were good that in a big crunch up there, we were going to be on our own. That's why we did it.  Host: Very, very critical thing to be able to do for sure. I want to take a step back and zoom in on the fact that this is the first expedition, which means you are going to be up in space for much longer than some of your previous shuttle missions. So, Expedition 1 was 136 days. What -- let's take a step back to your shuttle missions and talk about what they were like and then how that compared to Expedition 1. You -- I have three listed for you STS-27, 41, and 52. Your experiences on those?  Bill Shepherd: Well, they're all different flights, 27 and 41 were pretty short, up and down flights. Twenty-Seven was a high inclination Department of Defense mission. The idea was to launch, swing the orbit around to a 57-degree inclination -- yeah, 57 degrees. And then as soon as we're ready, put an object out into orbit and check it out and come back home. So, it was a great mission. But almost by the time you were really accustomed to where to look to see the ground and what the food was going to be like you were getting ready to land and come home. Sort of the same thing on STS-41. Our big mission there was a planetary probe built by the Europeans called Ulysses. That was a launch. Ulysses was a pretty interesting object that carried inertial upper stages and went to a trajectory that sent it over the back of Jupiter. And they did that to give it an adjustment to its orbital inclination where it would fly down in the, if you will, of the southern hemisphere of the solar system and fly over the South Pole of the sun. But again, short mission up and down in a couple of days. STS-52, well, launch day, a laser reflector satellite but did about a week and a half of materials experiments, but that was pretty much it. So, in contrast, my two Russian crewmates, Sergei in particular, had spent a year in orbit on the Mir. He was the Soviet cosmonaut who launched and came down a year later without a country because, in the meantime, the Soviet Union had gone away, and the Russian Federation had been set up. So -- and Yuri had experience on the Mir as well. So, my position as a low time flyer was not something that the Russians were particularly happy with.  Host: Well, then let's talk about Expedition 1 then. Let's zoom in on the training there. I think what's one of the major differences is the vehicle that's going to take you to and from orbit. All of your previous flights were on the space shuttle. Now you were getting ready to learn everything about the Russian Soyuz.  Bill Shepherd: So, the Russians have had the Soyuz spacecraft since the mid-60s. And they had a legacy of training quite a number of foreign cosmonauts or astronauts from different countries as guests to ride on the Soyuz. So, the mode of their training was that the Americans that showed up to work on the space station were trained as -- or they were started on a training flow that basically saw them as guest cosmonauts. And we had a big problem with that because we said, look, we're going to be up there. We're not going to be in contact with the ground all the time. We're going to have a limited number of crew, and we've got to know not only what happens when this button doesn't work, but maybe why something is impeding it, or what's behind the panel, or what's going on that this thing needs to know or do to make it work. And this is not really how Russians trained their cosmonauts. But we said, hey, this is a new ballgame, and this is the way we want to do it. And after many, many battles with the training staff and the program managers, we made that happen. And so, you know, the big thing about training in Russia and for the Soyuz in particular was all the Russian training was in Russian. We had lesson plans that were translated to English. We initially started down the road saying, OK, we can sit there and with an interpreter looking at the translated script for the training, we can get what we need to get, but soon became obvious that we would need to be really proficient in Russian. So, everybody from the U.S. side that was training for ISS in Russia learned Russian. And it has some other benefit, and the big one was many of the people who were in the training flow as instructors had had some involvement in the Russian space program that went back ten, 20, 30 years, there were people there who had worked on Sputnik and who had trained Yuri Gagarin. And so, these people were walking encyclopedias for how the Russians did things. And I thought, you know, I could talk to these people with interpreters, but I really want to know what they're thinking about and why they're doing something a certain way. I have to be able to talk to them in Russian. So, that's what we did. And it was not an easy part of the training, but it was necessary. And I think, in hindsight, I think everybody is really glad that we were able to do that because it gave us the necessary insight into how this other space entity works and thinks.  Host: And it's very interesting because all the astronauts I talked to today, right before their launches, and I'm talking in the past couple years, they always talk about, you know, Russian training, we're still doing it. A lot of them say it is one of the harder parts about training, a lot of them with technical backgrounds able to understand that a little bit easier than maybe the Russian language but still a very valuable part of what it is to be an expedition astronaut, even today.  Bill Shepherd: One of the things that came out of that, before we leave the language issue was it made me think of how would I approach this if I was Japanese or if I was an Italian or, you know, the many other countries that want to be involved with helping to crew the station. And I'm going, you know, for somebody who doesn't have English or Russian as a first language, it's doubly hard. And I'm going, there's got to be a way that we can bridge that with controls and displays and training material and diagrams that explain, if you will, what the crew has to deal with in such a way that the need for complete textual understanding of what you're doing is reduced. And so, we created a graphic environment that's used on the ground, used in training, used on the displays on the space station. Today, it's really part of how the station is operated. And it was designed at the time to be somewhat universal. So, people ask me -- once in a while, they say, “hey, Shep, well, 100 years from now, what do you think people will remember about the International Space Station?” I say, well, if we're really lucky, they will remember having heard the name but not much else about it. But I think one thing that will endure is this approach to having multinational crews who have to travel in space and do pretty complex things. This kind of human interface is something that I think we started that I think it's going to last for a long time.  Host: Very cool. I want to jump over to your Expedition and talk about the journey there. Because now we're here 20 years later from when you were getting ready to launch. Talk about your experience, I guess, after training in Baikonur, preparing for launch.  Bill Shepherd: Well, I would say it's not too different than what the U.S. and American astronauts do between Houston, the Cape, and the shuttle launches. You go down to Baikonur about three weeks before your launch for a practice countdown. And then about five days before you fly, you show up again. You have final checks in the vehicle. The capsule gets made into the booster rocket; that goes out to the pad. And then the launch countdown starts, and morning of October 31st, we get up early, early in the morning, get a bite to eat, jump in the bus go down to the assembly area where we get in our spacesuits and get those checked out. Take the bus out to the pad and get on the rocket. So, that whole process was -- I wouldn't say it's familiar, but the sequence and the steps involved were very understandable to the Americans there. I'd say the only difference really was the Russians had set the launch date and the liftoff time about four months in advance -- three or four months in advance. And that did not change, so we got out. Baikonur is out kind of on the high desert, very flat terrain, almost no vegetation. This was the middle of the fall. You get up early in the morning, and it's kind of misty and foggy. And then the fog kind of lifts a little bit. But at 10:30 in the morning, there was still about a 200-foot ceiling, which means you go 200 feet up, and you're up in the clouds. Nobody can see what's going on. The Russians pushed the button, lit the fuse, we launched, boom, up into the clouds away we went. The shuttle never would have flown in those conditions. And so, you know, that -- I think that says a lot about the differences in how the two space cultures operate.  Host: Now, how about that ride in the Soyuz? That was your first launch on a Soyuz vehicle. How did that compare to shuttle?  Bill Shepherd: Yeah, nothing really bad to say about it. I think there's a lot of goodness in the vehicle and the capsule itself. Their abort regimes, where you can stop doing what you're doing and get to a safe place, they're really pretty good. The rocket itself -- I think, when we flew the Soyuz, which is also called the booster rocket, the Soyuz launcher had been to the pad that we flew on. And they had 461 successful launches without a failure, or at least a failure that would threaten the crew. And those are pretty good numbers, and so despite the fact that the inside of the vehicle is extremely cramped, the couches are quite uncomfortable, the suits are a pain in the butt, [inaudible], you know, absolutely. But you got to ask yourself, do you want comfort? Or do you want robustness and reliability? And I think for most people, that's an easy choice.  Host: That's right. Now it was a longer journey, I guess, compared to what we're seeing nowadays with a six-hour rendezvous. You were you were orbiting the Earth for two days before actually rendezvousing with the International Space Station, and finally getting ready to enter. Can you describe that journey?  Bill Shepherd: Yeah, that was historically how the Russians planned their launch dynamics, if you will. We were launching in the plane of the station, but well behind it and below it in every route that we go around. Because we're circling the Earth somewhat faster. We're gradually catching up, and when we get within striking distance the last day, we do a little burn, zip up to the station, and dock. I think that was a consequence of the ability of the Russians to have really good knowledge of where the Soyuz vehicle was and where the target vehicle was and what the potential errors could be. And so, driving around in orbit to do docking burns up a fair amount of fuel. You only have so much, so I think they were initially very conservative about how they plan their flights. Up until about maybe six, eight years ago, that was the way they did it. But then they started doing rapid rendezvous within four to six hours to catch up. It's just a little different flight. It takes more precision, but somehow the Russians were able to change that.  Host: Now when you actually docked to the International Space Station, this was going to be the first, I guess, long-term crew. You had STS-88 before that -- the International Space Station. But what were some of those things you had to do to get the space station ready for continuous human habitation?  Bill Shepherd: Well, the docking was automatic. It was controlled by Mission Control Moscow. I'm sure that people have seen the video tapes of the downlink and all that. We drive into a docking cone. And once we get the hooks of the probe in the right spot in the cone, a couple of switches get flipped, and the two rings of the spacecraft get mated together and sealed. So, we open the hatch. We check the pressure. Everything's good, open the hatch. One of my first jobs was to sample the composition of the atmosphere, make sure nothing toxic was in there. Yuri and Sergei were running around with checklists. There was stuff that they had to do, but I guess the biggest panic, if you will, that we had on our first day docked was we had a live press event that was scheduled for about three or -- at the end of our day, but three or four hours after we had docked. And it required getting a television camera out, getting some lights, wiring everything up, turning everything on, assembling in the service module, looking at the camera, and then doing a live downlink to Moscow. And we could not find the cord that we needed to hook the camera up to the port where it was going to be on the radio system. Just frantic for about an hour looking for the dang thing, we finally got it.  Host: Very cool.  Bill Shepherd: But that was pressure.  Host: Well, you know, you talked about going through the hatch and getting everything prepared. But what was going through my mind is, is actually entering through the hatch. Now, I know today, we see crews being welcomed by crew members that are already onboard station, since we do have a continuous presence. But you being the first ones onboard to start this continuous presence, did you do anything special, any sort of ceremony, any words, even just between each other to really recognize that moment of entering the station for the first time?  Bill Shepherd: Not really. We did task -- we were on the phone with Mr. Koptev, who was the head of the Russian Space Agency and Mr. Goldin, who was then NASA administrator. They were both in mission control in Moscow. And each Russian crew that flew on this space station had their own call sign. And it was generally one that stayed with various astronauts -- cosmonauts rather, during their career. So, one astronaut would -- they're usually astronomical names, you know, like Mars or Mercury or something like that. And Yuri Gidzenko, who was the commander, if you will, for the Soyuz capsule, his Russian call sign was Uran. And one of the choices was going to be that during the mission, our Expedition was going to be referred to as Uran. And Yuri would be Uran-1. And Sergei would be Uran-2, and I was probably going to be Uran-3. And I did not like that for a couple reasons. So, we kind of jumped the gun and asked if we could use the radio call sign Alpha, Space Station Alpha. And the ground was kind of apoplectic, but they said, OK, for -- as a radio call sign, we'll call you that. And there was a little bit of hubbub about that, and I think that finally went away six or eight missions later, but people don't realize that not all words, in English, translate well into Russian. And the same thing is true of the Russian words to English, and Uran is the name of the planet Uranus. And so, I saw that as probably a public relations minefield that we didn't want to go in.  Host: Well, let's talk about the -- you're the first Expedition. So, I keep relating to the space station, as I know it today, we're in a period of utilization. The mission is research. But I'm sure in the early years, your mission was getting the station ready for research and getting it -- there's assembly efforts, especially in the beginning years. And of course, you had to activate the space station and get it ready for future crews. Can you talk about some of your mission objectives in your multi-month stay?  Bill Shepherd: Yeah, it was exactly that. We had initial work to get the oxygen generation system. But the bigger tissue was the carbon dioxide removal system. That had some hiccups getting started. We had a number of systems that did not power up correctly. Some of them had components that were inoperable, or one in particular had a multipin connector and some of the pins were bent. But the work that we had for Expedition 1 was troubleshooting all that and inserting tab A into slot B, if you will, and we were all very hands-on guys. And that's what we thought we were going to be doing up on orbit. We were very happy to be in orbit doing all that because that's what we trained for. So, that was a really rewarding part of the first -- certainly the first half of our Expedition. And I got to say one thing about that. We were told at least three times that I can remember where we had come in that a particular piece of hardware was not functional, or something was broken or wasn't working the way it was supposed to. And we would say, “OK, fine, what's the grounds plan to fix this?” And the capcom would say, “OK, space station, we'll get back to you on that.” And about a day later, we get to read from the ground, and they would say, “well, we've got that, we've got the plan to fix whatever that thing is that's broken.” And we said, “OK, great. What is it?” And they said, “well, we're sending up spares.” I said, we said, “great, OK, when are they going to get here?” The answer was six months after you guys leave, and we said, woah. So, in all those cases that I can remember, after a couple days, we would have a discussion with Moscow or Houston, and the discussion would be, “hey, we see that console or that component, it's up and running now. Can you give us any words on what's going on?” And we would say, “look, now we spent the last three days tearing that thing apart at night and trying to figure out why it wouldn't work and fixing it.” And the ground would say, “well, where did you get the procedure to do that? Or where did you get the spare parts? Or where did you get the tools? Or, you know, who told you, you could do that?” And we said, “hey, well, we figured we couldn't make it any worse. So, we tried to fix it, and we did. And we could break it, again, if you guys want to break it?” And the ground, say, “no, no, just keep it running, keep it running.” And the thing about that was, was we were constantly going back and forth with the ground on essentially what the capability of the crew was. And it kind of got down to try not to be too restrictive. You know, let us do some thinking about what we can and can't do. Try not to get ahead of us on this. And I really think that's probably not something they do a lot of today on station because it's so mature. But when we go back to the Moon, guaranteed, astronauts are going to be doing an awful lot of that. And the question is, how do we learn where and how to be able to do that without making things worse? And that's one of the big questions for the future. We've got to have people who have that mindset.  Host: Yeah, that mindset of autonomy. I know it's definitely talked about, not only for the Moon, which I'm sure it will be implemented, but for Mars, whenever. Just like you had experienced on Expedition 1 where you had several hours of communication gaps, there's going to be significant communication delays for a Mars mission. And so, that level of autonomy and the crew being able to solve problems real time without the help of the of the ground is absolutely something to consider.  Bill Shepherd: Yeah, I think if there's one comment that I would have, I have not seen enough of that thinking, if you will, on how NASA is planning to go back to the Moon. I think maybe you don't need it for the Moon, for the outset to do lunar exploration, but we certainly need to be good at it when we start talking about going to Mars. And practicing that on a Moon mission is the way to go.  Host: Zooming back to Expedition 1 for just a second. You talked about some of your mission objectives, but I'm curious about life. You know, as I mentioned before the station as I know it today, very big, lots of space, lots of food, lots of things to do, exercise equipment, and they've been doing it for 20 years. So, it's very much routine. But what was lifelike for the first long duration crew aboard this spacecraft?  Bill Shepherd: Well, it had a routine to it, which we liked. Initially, we were really constrained because we could only get in the service module. But gradually, as we were able to add more power and open the node up, and we got the lab brought onboard, it got to be really expensive. And life got pretty good because, you know, we had a routine. We marched through the day, and things were really good. I've got to say that one of the things that -- couple things really surprised me though. One was, I was in the middle of the service module. We got the node opened up. We were running around doing some things, middle of the day, late morning. And I'm gliding over the viewport in the service module, which is facing Nadir, looking down to the Earth. And we're going over the mouth of the Mediterranean Straits of Gibraltar, and this is the third time maybe that morning that we had been in that neck of the Earth since we woke up. And I looked over to Yuri who was over by the galley where all the food is. And I said, Yuri, “do we have any more coffee over there?” And he was rifling through the coffee packs to see what was there. And I thought about, and I said, you know, I'm looking at the most fantastic view probably anybody ever has at this moment on the planet. And all I can think about is, you know, is there another cup of coffee in the galley? And it struck me that how normal being in this really abnormal situation had become, and I go, wow, this is really surprising. And I saw that a lot on our flight, and I've seen many crews after us in their on-orbit discussions and their debrief say exactly the same thing. It's incredible how adaptive humans are and how quickly these completely bizarre circumstances become routine.  Host: No, I hear that all the time. Just how this life onboard becomes routine. And just, you know, this view, you see it because you're circling the Earth 16 times a day. So, it does become a very regular thing still, you know, amazing to think about from here on the ground, especially for those of us who have not had that view but just an appreciation for the ability to adapt, as you're saying. You know, the station now, as I said, you just -- not only get used to it, but you have -- you have so many amenities, I guess, on the station, now. You have you have your own place to sleep. You have a sort of a dinner table where everybody can get together and eat off of the same dinner table. What was -- what were some of those elements of life on station with only three modules? You know, where were you sleeping? Where were you -- where were you eating together? It didn't seem like you had a lot of room to spare.  Bill Shepherd: Well, Sergei and I were in the service module sleep quarters, little rooms in the back end of the service module. Yuri had -- Yuri, he chose to bunk out first in the Soyuz. He slept on his Soyuz couch, which was kind of his command chair. When you're in zero gravity, as long as you're not banging into stuff, it really doesn't matter where you sleep because your body position is just kind of this slightly contracted relaxed position. And both Sergei and I had these little sleeping bags, you kind of zip yourself up in it so you're not banging around but quite comfortable. Yuri had a seat belt. He'd put that on and away we went. We did not have a kitchen table, and this was a big issue with the ground because we thought, we were told, we had trained, and we had thought we'd come up, and we'd find a kitchen table in a bag or a box or something. We talked to the ground after we -- about a couple days after we got on orbit, we said, hey, TsUP, the Russian center, we said, “where's our kitchen table?” They said, “well, we left that off the flight because we had stowage and weight problems, and we'll send it up to you.” And we said, “OK, fine. When's it going to show up?” Again, it was, “yeah, six months after you guys get there.” So, for about three weeks, we had a stealth project, and we took parts off of, if you will, shipping containers that came up in the Progress cargo ship. They were these aluminum racks and bars, and we built our own kitchen table out of scrap. And again, the ground went nuts, but it turned out to be a very workable arrangement. Second Expedition used it and liked it a lot. And I thought, actually, from a design standpoint, because it was a little bit smaller than the big kitchen table that was originally designed, that it was a little more workable. It wasn't in a way as much, but that got de-manifested when the big table came up. And I think that that piece of hardware is in a museum somewhere. But again, it's a question of letting the crews to kind of adapt to their own space, to build on that a little bit more. Every crew I've seen on station, they get to the point where they see themselves in an environment that's really not part of the Earth anymore, at least for, you know, a couple months. And that's a really important kind of mental construct as to how astronauts see themselves in relation to Earth.  Host: Now, you mentioned you -- when you were talking to the ground, you said, “that's not going to come for another six months.” Was that the arrival of the 102 crew, the space shuttle that arrived? And what else did they bring?  Bill Shepherd: Well, actually, the table came after the 102 crew. So, I think the six months might -- the table showing up might have been the -- at the end of their Expedition. But 102 brought up the [Multipurpose Logistics Module] MPLM, the Italian logistics module that the Italian Space Agency was providing. And that was also Susan Helms, Jim Voss, and Commander Yuri Usachev, and we spent the week with them on orbit. People outside hooking stuff up, and then Jim and Susan, I guess, did a spacewalk or two, I guess. And then when we do these docked events with a shuttle because of the reduced pressure that the shuttle has to be at for the EVAs, we generally have the hatches closed. So, it's the shuttle docks, you have some initial meet and greet, then it's a couple days of hatches closed. And we open the hatches up when the EVAs are done. So, you know, very hectic time, a lot of running around moving bags and cargo, get any the MPLM attached to the station. But it was great to see all these people that we had worked and trained with for years, and now they're up on orbit, and we're going to get on Discovery, close the hatch and go home.  Host: Now, one thing before you went home that I believe it was you who instituted this was, it's a tradition that's still carried on today, handing over command of the International Space Station. You as the first commander, that change of command ceremony with a bell and handing over of I think it was a key that was started by you. And that was inspired by your time in the Navy. Is that right?  Bill Shepherd: Yes. And it was something that we had talked about, both with the Russian cosmonauts and the other astronauts in Houston, that we wanted to do. Simply because we had two control centers at that point. We have four now, at least. I think we might have five, I'm not sure. But the -- who was in charge of the space station in later years in the modern era definitely gets passed around from country to country and even, you know, nationality or nationality as far the station commander. So, anticipating that we thought, you know, the Navy has a long tradition of doing this, and it's the Royal Navy in the UK, the Russian Navy does it, the U.S. Navy does it. Then you have this little ceremony where you say, OK, fine, here's the crew, and we're going to tell you something, and here's the new guy who's in charge. And this is what he's going to do, and so it's a change of command. And we thought that was a really important cultural thing to introduce to the space station. I think at first the Russians were going -- they're scratching their head saying, you know, what are these Americans doing now? But I think today, they and the Canadians, the Japanese and the Europeans really like it because it really sets the tone for the next phase of station operations and how it's going to be run.  Host: Now, when you came home, you came home on the space shuttle. And this was a little bit different for you in that -- the time you spent in space was much longer than you had previously on your other shuttle missions. How were you feeling when you came back now that you had spent so much time in your space, your body adjusting to 1 g after a long Expedition?  Bill Shepherd: I had a really good experience. I don't really know why. I know we spent a lot of time on our days on orbit getting what exercise we could. We had a little jungle gym that we worked on. It was new. That really seemed to be beneficial. My experience coming back after the ISS flight was probably as good as my shorter shuttle flights. And I felt really good. I did not have any particular uneasiness, you know, neurovestibular issues or anything like that. As a little experiment, the day after we got back, the morning after the day we had landed, we were going to pile into a van out of the parking lot at the Kennedy Space Center, and we're going to go somewhere for some kind of test. And when you're walking around to do these things, you have a flight surgeon right with you and maybe one or two other handlers just in case you start going wobbly, you know, they'll catch you. And I felt pretty good, and so, we're out in the parking lot. I talked to my flight doc, and I said, now, Terry -- and he was going to drive the van. I said, “Terry, let me try driving the van.” And Terry, he's holding his hand on his head. It's Sunday morning. And it's like 6:00 o'clock in the lobby, in the lot outside the [Operations and Checkout] O&C building at KSC. There's nobody in the parking lot. There's no cars in the parking lot. And he says, OK, but just take it really -- so I got in the car, and I'm driving around really slowly, and I could turn really slowly. Didn't like braking abruptly, but, you know, as long as I was easy on the controls, it was OK. And I did that for about three or four minutes. I stopped, got out, and I thought to myself, this is the kind of thing that we're going to be doing. When we go to Mars, and we have a long journey, we're going to be weightless, we have a landing, we're all going to pile out, and we're going to be in rovers and things like that. And I thought about that, and I said to myself, we can do this.  Host: That's big. That's very big. That means that, you know, as we're shaping what that's going to look like, that little experiment you did in the parking lot might actually prove useful as to how humans can perform on another surface. You know, we've learned so--  Bill Shepherd: Like, it's not well documented, but I think that's the kind of stuff we'll be looking.  Host: [Laughter] That's right. You know, we learned so much just from the International Space Station just past yours. I know you retired from NASA in 2001 but taking a look at the whole Space Station Program after your mission going from -- starting in 2000. Now, here we are 2020. You know, what do you take away from the experience of what you've seen maybe from the outside of what we have -- or what value the International Space Station throughout these past 20 years has brought us?  Bill Shepherd: I think people maybe have not experienced or don't remember what a technical and programmatic and possibly just diplomatic challenge the space station really was. And the fact that we're able to do it, I don't think the space station's had a major technical casualty that I'm aware of, since we launched. We've had, what, 63 Expeditions on there that have all been very successful. We have multiple ways to get to the station now. So, you got to step back and say, well, what does this really mean, in terms of the future? What, you know, what does it say about what's next? And I say, well, if we're going to go past the Moon, out to Mars, and maybe other places, asteroids and things like that, the character of how we will do this, it's going to have several aspects. One is the vehicles that we send, and they're probably going to be more than one of them, are going to be very big. They're going to be such a size that they can't be assembled on the ground and launched in a single lift. We don't have the boosters that are going to have enough power. So, they're going to have to be assembled in orbit with EVA and robotics. And they're going to have to combine the resources of more than just one country because the expanse of a Mars mission is not something any single country is going to be able to afford, nor would they have all the technology and capability that will be required. And so, if you look at International Space Station, it's really a blueprint for how to do this. And so, I think all those questions, they're behind us.  Host: That's just an incredible thing to think about, you know, the space station, not only for informing exploration plans. We're talking about the Moon. We're talking about Mars. And having a foundation of international cooperation is really, thanks to the space station program. I know one thing we're looking forward to in the near future, you talked about multiple ways to get to the space station now. That's an era of commercialization with commercial crew. And I know there's efforts to commercialize low-Earth orbit and thinking about what else is going to be in low-Earth orbit in the future, and it'll be thanks to the space station that's informing some of those commercial enterprises. Do you think there's value there to the space station as a platform to help build an economy in low-Earth orbit?  Bill Shepherd: Well, I think it's a big question that hinges on what do commercial operations really who -- or commercial enterprises, what do they look like? I think it's hard to have a commercial market when NASA's the only customer. It kind of stretches to the question of is it really a commercial event? If we were able to find some material, invent or develop something that could only be done in space that both had tremendous value, either in the space-based economy or back here on Earth, then I think you'd see commercial space really take off. Everybody's very optimistic that we are going to find something like that. I know that if we don't look for it, then we're not going to find it.  Host: That's right. Now thinking about that, you know, you got to make sure that NASA is not just the only customer, that we're one of many customers. And we're also looking at exploration. We got this Artemis Program, and that's going to inform our exploration plans for Mars. How do you see NASA's role for the future?  Bill Shepherd: Well, I think it's an open question right now. I would like to see NASA take a strong role in leading the technology development and organizing the architecture for how we're going to do lunar exploration and certainly Mars expeditions. I think that's the right place for NASA. The one negative comment that I would have is that we're -- NASA is a political animal, if you will. And we tend to have great periods of very robust development and operations and then a stand down for a decade or two before we do the next big thing. We did that in the Moon program. We did that in shuttle. We're probably going to do that when space station's past its peak and getting ready for some sort of disposition. I don't think it's a very healthy way to have a robust, space capable organization. If we could change that for the better, I think it'd be a tremendous thing.  Host: I absolutely believe that too. Bill Shepherd, thank you so much for coming on Houston We Have a Podcast and sharing the history of what it took to get to Expedition 1, your experience there, and then what you helped shape for 20 continuous years onboard the International Space Station. I very much appreciate your time.  Bill Shepherd: I'm happy to be with you and your audience. Thank you.  [ Music]  Host: Hey, thanks for sticking around.

                        "description": "Gary Jordan (Host): Houston, we have a podcast. Welcome to the official podcast of the NASA Johnson Space Center, Episode 173, “Students in Spacesuits.” I'm Gary Jordan, and I'll be your host today. On this podcast, we bring in the experts, scientists, engineers, astronauts, all to let you know what's going on in the world of human spaceflight. This one is for the students and teachers out there that want to get involved with NASA, and even getting some experience with NASA before you hit college. NASA has some exciting ways to get involved in America's space agency and get real hands-on experience. An initiative called NASA SUITS [Spacesuit User Interface Technologies for Students] is doing just that. And there are some incredible challenges to get involved with where students can contribute to actual NASA missions. On this episode, we're bringing in Brandon Hargis, who is an Education Specialist and the NASA SUITS Activity Manager. And Paromita Mitra who is a human interface engineer and the NASA SUITS Technical Lead. They're both here at the Johnson Space Center. We talk about some of the more recent challenges and how you can stay tuned for some upcoming opportunities. Let's get right into it. Enjoy.  [ Music]  Host: Brandon and Paromita. Thanks, so much for coming on Houston We Have A Podcast today.  Brandon Hargis: Thanks for having us.  Paromita Mitra: Yeah, thanks for having us. Excited to be here.  Host: This is a really cool program. We have, NASA SUITS. I'm excited to dive into it and sort of get a background really, on what this program is and how you're contributing to the overall, I guess, spacesuit community. Really cool stuff. But I like how we have you both here because Brandon, you're on the education side. Paromita, you're on the engineering side. I'm curious to hear about your backgrounds and how this whole thing came together, how education and engineering came into this one project here. So, Brandon, why don't we start with you? Tell us about yourself and what you do for NASA.  Brandon Hargis: So, I'm a NASA education specialist in the Office of STEM Engagement at Johnson Space Center. I manage the NASA SUITS challenge for students. And it is a nationwide challenge that involves undergraduate and graduate students from institutions all over the United States and Territories. I have a bachelor's degree in middle grades education, a master's degree in education, administration and leadership. I'm also currently pursuing a PhD in education, learning design and technology at Oklahoma State University, which I'm looking forward to completing in December of '22. And I came to NASA in 2009. I started at Langley Research Center in Virginia. And I've been at Johnson Space Center since 2015. I started out doing professional development workshops for educators and student programs and public engagement activities. And the last three, going on four years, I've been an IPA and that's Intergovernmental Personnel Agreement. And basically, that just allows me to manage activities like NASA SUITS as an employee here at Johnson Space Center. So, I'm really excited about the activities that we're going to talk about today that NASA SUITS is doing this year.  Host: Very cool, Brandon. And I love your whole background on education. You've really dedicated a lot of your academic life to learning about educating students and teaching them new things. I'm curious to hear your perspective on what you're passionate about in terms of teaching them specifically about from the NASA perspective, about STEM, Science, Technology, Engineering, Math and then even human spaceflight, some of the ways that those two passions combine for you.  Brandon Hargis: Yeah, what really started me on this journey was I was teaching early on in 1999 and early 2000s in middle grades science classrooms. I got involved with NASA professional development and realizing that I could engage my students with NASA missions and NASA content in learning the subjects within the science classroom at a much higher rate of engagement. And the students were excited about it, excited about learning. And so, then when I came to NASA and was basically sharing this work with educators across the country and inspiring them to also consider using NASA content and missions in their lesson planning and unit planning. And now with the SUITS activity being so focused on how we can have students contribute to technical solutions for NASA missions like Artemis, and going to the Moon, starting in 2024, the idea is to one, increase their 21st century skills, creativity, communication, collaboration, and communication. I think already said communication. But we really want to increase those skills and give them authentic experiences with technical problems. So, this problem solving, which is another 21st century skill, and also integrating the knowledge that they're gaining from the courses they're taking at institutions in computer science, but also human factors courses. We've had students involved that are in kinesiology or involved that were in more of a psychology background or marketing and so forth, and graphics. And having all of these diverse backgrounds coming together to offer a solution that is very diverse in nature, but also provide some concepts that can help our technical community as they're looking to the future of what they want the SUITS capabilities to be. And so, all of that combined I think provides a very rich experience for the students. It also gives them material to produce new research and development in a field that is relatively new if we consider augmented reality, head mounted displays only having been out for a few -- you know, just a handful of years. Even though augmented reality may go back a couple of decades or so. The work that they're doing is on the cutting edge. It's pushing the research and development in that field not only to benefit our technical community at NASA and the work that we're doing, but also the STEM community at large. The higher education academic institutions at large, they're creating new courses, they're revising courses as a result of SUITS content. So, we're just very excited about these opportunities that the students are having and being afforded as a result.  Host: I'm definitely looking forward to hearing more about the SUITS challenge because the augmented reality stuff I think, is just so high tech, and I'm trying to imagine myself as a student, just being like, \"What? I get to do that?\" So that's going to be really cool to get into. But I think your discussion on diverse background, I think that is a perfect way to lead into Paromita. Paromita, you're on the technical side. Brandon just talked about his education background. You're an engineer. Tell us about yourself and your work with NASA.  Paromita Mitra: Yeah, so I have a background in aerospace engineering in undergrad and grad school. Specifically, my role at Johnson, I am in the avionics systems division, which is an engineering directorate. And so, within avionics, it's a lot of electrical engineers. But also, specifically, I'm in the human interface branch. So, my primary title, I'm a human interface engineer, but I'm also a Principal Investigator. The main project that I contribute to is the xEMU. So, as a lot of you may know, the xEMU [Exploration ExtraVehicular Mobility Unit] is the next generation suit that's going to the Moon. And my primary job on that suit is as the displays and controls component owner. And so, primarily I developed the display for xEMU for future lunar missions. And within that display, I proposed a project called Joint Augmented Reality Visual Informatics System. And so, I proposed that to NASA Headquarters, a funding line called early career initiative. And we were actually awarded it for 2020 and 2021, which is super exciting. But in a nutshell, we're developing all of the displays and controls requirements on xEMU. And so, that's my primary job, is being the PI for that project while also being the component owner for xEMU. So, they're pretty much, they go hand in hand. In a nutshell, that's what I do. So, I guess in summary, my role on SUITS would be as a SUITS technical lead. So as one of my many other tasks, leading the displays and controls work, working with Brandon. I'm very lucky to have someone with an education that is as knowledgeable as Brandon. But also from a technical standpoint, I help to guide a lot of the mission descriptions and statements for each year, which make the students -- which help the students develop technology for augmented reality, develop software for augmented reality that is most applicable to what xEMU needs, and what the EVA community at Johnson is really looking for. So, as a technical lead for SUITS and in that role, I really help guide a lot of the mission statements for SUITS and really set up the EVA scenario for what we're looking to develop.  Host: See, I think what's cool about this topic, Paromita, is as you were going into depth on just the technical knowledge that you have and your expertise on some of the work for the xEMU. But what's unique about this topic is we're talking about this complicated idea of doing some sort of, I guess, the human interface sort of engineering here. And you're talking about bringing in students and having younger people contribute to the project. What do you think is the benefit here from your perspective as the engineer to involve students in coming up with some of these concepts and ideas?  Paromita Mitra: Absolutely, that's a great question. When I entered my master's program in aerospace engineering, I was given a problem statement. I reached out to some engineers at Johnson and I was working on a project in collaboration with engineers at Johnson and engineers on xEMU to really prove out human performance and feasibility of a possible heads up display, or a head mounted display on an older suit called the Mark III. And so, when I was entering that field of augmented reality, looking at unique displays and visual agents for the EVA workflow, I realized that it's a really small field. And there was not -- I think, I found like one or two papers that I could reference in the field altogether, that, you know, had -- they were measuring human metrics in an EVA world while using augmented reality as an aide. And to me, being early in this field, I really was wishing that there were other universities, other programs, other professors that were trying to find solutions to these problems. And within human spaceflight in general, I think something that Brandon mentioned earlier about this cross disciplinary field and having students from various backgrounds. I think in human spaceflight in general, and specifically on the spacesuit, we are engineering a system that is very close to the human. It is a one-person spacecraft. And so that requires -- that in itself requires us to be very cross disciplinary in how we approach problems. We need to have a medical understanding, to some extent. We need to have an understanding of design, of mechanical engineering, thermal systems, electrical engineering. It's kind of an all-encompassing problem statement within xEMU. And so, for me, I think what SUITS is really providing is, every year we turn on a new problem statement. And it gives academia this entire problem space to explore and develop. And SUITS provides the Subject Matter Experts from JSC, from NASA who are directly evaluating their designs. And we're having this back and forth with academia and expanding the research and development for visual displays, for the purposes of EVA. And looking at human performance and looking at all of these cross disciplinary fields. And so, that's I think the biggest value and why I love working with SUITS in general.  Host: Yeah, broaden the -- not just keep it to just spacesuits in general. But just broaden the interest and awareness of this concept and maybe get some more research just all across the board that could be implemented for not just spacesuits but for other things. I absolutely love it. With that, I want to go into SUITS itself. You know, what is this this program? Of course, it's an acronym that stands for Spacesuit User Interface Technologies for Students. Brandon at a high level, what is NASA SUITS?  Brandon Hargis: So, NASA SUITS, again, to kind of put this into perspective at a high level is a mission-driven challenge for students to design and create spacesuit information displays in augmented reality environments. So, we ask them to create the software user interface. And we give them some tools in a virtual community. We ask them to use off the shelf hardware to display the software that they end up creating from that. And it's really meant to provide solutions for the technical community, which in this case, Paromita is the interface for those solutions that come in. And so, we want to produce these solutions that the technical community can use with the student work.  Host: So, that is a nice description of essentially what -- you know, what it is that you're doing. But to kind of get some background on just, you know, what it's like, I guess, to participate in SUITS. Brandon, some of the things that you've gone through in the past because this is not the first year that you've done SUITS. This is not a new thing. You've got a couple years under your belt.  Brandon Hargis: Yeah, so in the first year this kind of started as a meeting between the EVA manager and our director in the Office of External Relations. There was a conversation that took place about the need for future forward development that wasn't necessarily ready to be worked by the technical community at NASA. And our external relations director, who is now the Associate Administrator for the Office of STEM Engagement at NASA, Mr. Mike Kincaid, suggested that why don't we have students help out with this? And students can do the work to create these concepts. It's going to benefit them as they're looking to develop their careers, but it's also going to benefit the NASA technical community because you start to get some concepts for what future work could do and what it could look like. And also, to understand what some of the pitfalls might be, and what to avoid. And so, this conversation began, and I came on board at that time, ready to head up an activity and was told, \"Hey, check this out. See if there's something you can develop with this. We think it would be very successful collaboration and partnership between the EVA community and the Office of STEM Engagement.\" At the time, Office of Education. And so, we had our first challenge using a task board that was designed to mimic an astronaut's tasks at a fixed location during an EVA or a spacewalk for International Space Station. And that analog was successful for a first-year pilot. So, the second year, we moved on to an actual EVA task that involved a mockup at our space vehicle mockup facility at Johnson Space Center. And the students designed their software interfaces to be able to repair the bearing ring -- bearing ring roll module, the BMRRM -- Bearing Motor Ring Roll Module. There we go. And we then had them work with a design evaluator when they came on site for the onsite testing, to train that design evaluator to use their software designs and complete the tasks. It worked out very well. We had some great feedback from those evaluators to the teams. And as I said, last year we moved more toward a focus on Artemis missions, where we had students developing solutions for planetary EVAs for the Moon. And so, it's been a very successful challenge so far in the last three years, again, tying the technical community, their problems identified by the technical community and solutions then developed by the students.  Host: So, you know, we're talking about solutions here for a spacesuit. And I think it kind of begs the question of, OK, so solutions and I'm thinking, what are the challenges here? And I think what's unique about this is some of these -- the one that we're in now, at least the challenge now and Paromita, correct me if I'm wrong here, is we're talking about solving challenges for an astronaut that is walking on the Moon, is that right?  Paromita Mitra: Correct.  Host: So, take us through some of the challenges. OK. You have a spacesuit on. What are the challenges that are presented by wearing a spacesuit? Some of the considerations just in general. And then the considerations of the Moon itself? What you know, now the challenges of walking on another celestial body.  Paromita Mitra: Absolutely. So, I think one of the interesting fun facts about NASA is that we have the EMU spacesuit. And I think it's a fun fact to say that it's one of NASA's currently oldest spacecraft that we've been flying continuously. But it's a spacecraft for one person. The EMU, the older spacesuit that that's the microgravity suit, is entirely gas pressurized. So, you're working against this gas pressurized volume. So physically, you're being loaded by this gas pressurized volume, and you're working against that. And so that becomes physically cumbersome. An EVA in itself is technically -- excuse me, typically like eight hours or so. And so, you're physically working in that gas pressurized environment, doing dexterity tasks, with some bulkier gloves that have to be gas pressurized, and it's a little bit difficult to articulate your fingers as well. Cumbersome I think would be the better word. And so physically, it's a little bit tasking. You're also -- let's think about, let's think back to the AMS repairs, our Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer, those EVAs that happened. I think it was like a series of four of them or so. That was one of the most complex engineering systems that an astronaut has ever had to fix. And so, you're also cognitively loaded. So, you are being tasked cognitively by having to do complex engineering tasks, what have you. And so, with the EMU and in that sense, you're physically and cognitively loaded. Now, with the xEMU we do have -- there's a lot of improvements that have been made to the EMU suit. Primarily because this is a surface suit, we really want the bearings and the hip and shoulder movements to be a lot more seamless. There's a hard-upper torso in the xEMU. So, mobility in the xEMU is a little bit easier than traditionally the gas pressurized Apollo suits and EMU suits. So, with the xEMU in general, mobility is going to be improved immensely. But it will still -- you'll still be working against that gas pressurized environment. So physically and cognitively crew members are quite tasked during an EVA. Now on the Moon itself, we're going to this completely new environment. Today on Earth, we typically have landmarks which tell us which -- like you can say, \"Hey, turn left at that McDonald's and you'll get to Regions Bank or whatever.\" But on the Moon, we don't have landmarks like that. So, navigating and knowing how far away you are from objects or knowing how deep a crater is -- there's a lot of uncertainty there. So, on top of the physical and cognitive loading, your environment in itself is quite uncertain because you don't have landmarks, or this is an unpopulated area. You're going to a completely new region. And your primary task is to explore and be really efficient in navigating the space. If you go through -- if you look at a geologist, what their primary goal is while they're doing a field study is to understand the geography of that region very well. And so, when we're going to explore a new terrain like the south pole of the Moon as we are in Artemis, these challenges can be mitigated in a lot of different ways. And we believe on xEMU that the displays and control system would be one of the ways to mitigate some of those challenges. Today, the astronaut gets -- I shadowed an EVA recently and there was pretty much almost like a game of telephone with MCC [Mission Control Center] and the crew. So, astronauts currently get direction over audio. And so, if you ever talk to your parents over the phone and tried to get them to reset the Wi-Fi router, it's pretty difficult. So, to develop the displays and controls system, it would really help to visually aid the crew member. And that would really help with some of the cognitive load that I was mentioning earlier. While also, for this year's SUITS challenge, we're really focusing on a big navigation element, because that's probably one of our biggest questions from a displays and controls perspective, something that we're not currently able to attain. And so, that's in a nutshell I guess, what we see are some of the big challenges.  Host: Now, you know, I'm pretending I'm an astronaut now and I'm in the spacesuit. And I'm imagining like “Iron Man” from the movie, right? Just all these like digital things are coming up on my face.  Paromita Mitra: Right.  Host: So, if all these things are coming up in my face, and you're talking about, you know, like step by step directions on how to reset the Wi-Fi router. What exactly is it that you think would be beneficial from an astronaut's perspective to have in their face? I see navigation, yes. But what exactly about navigation and then what exactly about the suit? What would be some of those things that you would want to consider to have in front of your face?  Paromita Mitra: So, there is a concept of operations at the EVA office level. And that really drives a lot of what the suit does. It drives a lot of what the displays and controls ultimately does. The displays and controls, however, are a solution for future lunar missions. And it's probably where a lot of that uncertainty is. And we're trying to understand and explore what those feature sets are going to be. Today, in the Joint Augmented Reality Visual Informatics System project, for the displays and control project that I lead, the primary objectives of this display is to have procedures -- to be able to show procedures to the crew, and MCC controls those procedures. The other is to have a camera functionality. So, there's a crew camera on the suit. And one of the difficult things about that is that they don't have a viewfinder to be able to point that camera. They don't have any situational awareness of what that camera is doing. If they wanted to use that camera to guide mission control, they wouldn't know what their camera's actually seeing. So, the display in itself could act as a viewfinder for that camera, amongst other geology tasks, like taking pictures of rock formations or what have you. And then the third thing is understanding the suit system state or suit telemetry. And similarly, for the SUITS design challenge, we asked the students to execute procedures, execute suit telemetry. And then this other piece that we really want to explore and have academia pursue is navigation. And that's why navigation is a really big focus this year for the challenge.  Host: So, I'm trying to go back to the to the Wi-Fi example, Paromita. I love this one.  Paromita Mitra: Yeah.  Host: So, all the things that you would want, or just at least some of the considerations, right? You said you're still trying to figure it out. But for the Wi-Fi example, right, you're talking to your parents, and I'm thinking you're doing it like over like a video call, right? So, the procedures that you're talking about would be step by step instructions on, \"OK, first, you got to, you know, unplug it, then plug it back in. Or press a button, whatever.\" So that would all be part of the display, is the step by step instructions. Those are your procedures. Then the visual system, right, that camera. I love that idea, that they don't really have an idea of where that camera is pointing. But if you are showing them something on your phone, you have instant feedback, because you're seeing the view from the camera itself that visual system.  Paromita Mitra: Exactly.  Host: And all of these components would be something that's put into a spacesuit, right? These are all things that help you to tell your parents how to reset the Wi-Fi router, but we kind of take them for granted. Now imagine that in a spacesuit. That's kind of what where my brain is going here.  Paromita Mitra: Exactly.  Host: Yeah.  Paromita Mitra: That, that hits it on the dot.  Host: This is how I have to think, Paromita. I'm not the engineering type. But I have helped some folks with some Wi-Fi routers. Brandon, the SUITS challenge in general, tell me about the challenge that we have right now. You know, Paromita already hinted towards this idea of navigation. What are the students that are participating in SUITS right now, what are they doing?  Brandon Hargis: So right now, we actually just finished receiving proposals from teams. And so, we're in the process of reviewing those proposals, but we expect the students are currently in planning to attack the tasks that we put forward to them. Which do include the navigation tasks that Paromita mentioned in getting from point A to point B, getting back to the lander from some location away from the lander, identifying geological points of interest. But also, they're preparing for communicating with other devices outside the suit. So, system state tests like the lander suit port interaction, where they would ingress/egress from the airlock. They're going to be able to manipulate some switches that will allow them to know what their suit consumable status is, as well as interact with another direct control unit device that will allow them to see changes through their software that they're developing in suit consumables. We also asked them to tackle the science sampling task as a part of this challenge, where they may have a system that's able to interact with science tools. Maybe it's tool recognition. We leave this fairly open for them. We give them some broad general goals. But we try not to be too prescriptive in what we're asking them to do, because we want them to be very open and creative. This is also a very collaborative challenge. And so, we encourage them to collaborate with the other teams, to garner ideas from each other. And also, to work with Subject Matter Experts at NASA to help guide their creativity and innovation. We will be assigning mentors, NASA mentors, to the teams that will have some contact with them throughout the coming months after the selection process is complete. And we hope that that gives the students some NASA perspective as they design toward their solutions that they'll present later this year in April. So right now, I hope that they are planning, they're putting together their schedule of work with milestones, which is very important for this challenge. There's a lot of planning involved in meeting milestones and meeting those deadlines that allow a successful project to come together ahead of their software design review that they will have coming up in March. And at that point, they need to be ready to present the work that they're doing. And so, planning right now is essential to success for these teams.  Host: So, Brandon, we're getting a little bit of a snapshot here on the expectations of the students. Sounds like there's a lot of planning on the forward end. And then there's a presentation on the back end. So, what are the expectations through the whole duration of this program? You know, what's happening in this timeframe from the time that they apply, and they submit their proposals to the time that they're presenting? What are the students participating in?  Brandon Hargis: Yeah, we typically open our recruiting and open our proposal process in late August. We ask student teams to submit a letter of intent to us. It's not exclusive. It does not exclude teams from giving us a proposal. But it does give us an idea of how many teams are interested in the challenge and lets us know if we should ramp up our promotion to reach more teams. But then in October, usually mid to late October, we have our proposals due. And so, students can attend two to three virtual sessions, information sessions that we will host. We broadcast those out for anyone to attend. And we typically will have Paromita or someone from the technical team represented to give more answers to the technical questions that they may have. So, we help prepare them along the way for what they're creating. We select our teams in late November to early December. This year, our selection is taking place for a live selection show, which will be hosted on November the 17th and recorded, so it'll be available on YouTube, the NASA STEM YouTube channel afterward. And then from really that point on, they are designing, they're creating, putting together this solution that they're going to configure within their augmented reality headset. This year we have a virtual challenge. And so, students will not be traveling to Houston in April, but they will ship their devices after completing the software design review in March. Those devices will be shipped to JSC for us to test here on site in a scenario that we've developed to help them meet all of these tasks that we've asked them to complete. And so that software design review is very important because it helps us understand more about the work students have put into their design, how it works, and whether it's ready to be tested when it arrives here. So that's really kind of the rundown up through the test week. After our test week, students are asked to submit a draft of a white paper that they will attempt to have published in a technical journal or at a technical conference, that we asked them to work with their faculty advisor in creating this publication. It provides them with practice in writing research papers, but also an opportunity to get published and to present their work to the wider technical community. That is typically due within a month after the test week. And then they have the remaining time after that to seek publication and update us on the success of their publications. We then begin our planning processes for the following year, for the next cycle. And we start all over again, the next August.  Host: See, if I'm a student here, I mean, that sounds -- the expectations here are so high. I'm thinking if I'm a student, like, wow, that's certainly a lot of work. But then at the same time, it's all work that pays off. And, you know, you're talking about publication, you're talking about spreading your ideas to a much larger community. And I think that's something a lot of people can get behind and be passionate about. Paromita, I know in the beginning, you mentioned when you were a student, you know, you tried looking for some of these concepts because you were interested in them, and you had some trouble finding, you know, all these papers. You know, so it sounds like this is a way for more papers to be submitted. But at the same time, you know, if I'm a student and I want to learn about this and participate in this challenge, where would you point students to go ahead and start learning now, so they can participate in SUITS maybe later on?  Paromita Mitra: Absolutely. So, the field of humans and aerospace, as a lot of people call it, or human systems integration, is really approachable by a lot of different -- I guess engineering disciplines or educational disciplines. But for the SUITS design challenge specifically, it is a software design challenge. And if you're building on software for a specific augmented reality headset -- many of the popular ones are the Microsoft HoloLens and the Magic Leap headset. Primarily students will develop their software in a game engine. So, when you're developing augmented reality software, you're working in a game engine and that game engine is called Unity. And so honestly, YouTube has plenty of tutorials for learning on how to develop in Unity. It's pretty straightforward. For the Microsoft HoloLens, Microsoft has a suite of helpful resources. They have tutorials online. You can just Google how to develop apps for the Microsoft HoloLens. And you'll just come across a huge user community. We also have some Slack channels that we've pointed the students towards that are just developer communities for the software design aspect of it. And there's also this other aspect of SUITS where we do human in the loop testing. And we really have to be thoughtful about human centered design. And for that, human factors courses in the field of humans in aerospace is rather new, I would say. Probably in the mid to late ‘90s is really when things started gearing up. As you might know, there's also a human systems integration employee resource group here at JSC to ensure that we are focusing on human centered design. But that field of study, there are universities and programs and graduate programs that offer classes in human factors. I took a lot of my classes in graduate school, were in a computer science department for human/computer interaction, human/robot interaction, fascinating fields of study. And so, I would suggest looking to those classes and taking those classes. One of the pieces of SUITS is asking the students to develop human in the loop studies to validate their designs. And so, how do you set up a human study? What are the factors and objectives of this study that I'm trying to measure? And being really thoughtful about your population size and the people that you're measuring. So, a lot of that is available. I would suggest taking those classes and really digging into the literature of human factors and human systems engineering. So, those are probably the two primary tenants of SUITS as a whole.  Host: See, Paromita -- oh, go ahead, Brandon.  Brandon Hargis: The other thing I would add to that is just to say that for the challenge itself, I would also direct students to go to stem.NASA.gov/Artemis, where they can find SUITS as well as the other Artemis student challenges. And we keep that information up to date throughout the year as we move toward the next round of challenges. And so, we put a lot of the resources and things that they're going to need for writing a proposal as well as reading about the current challenge on there. Also, Paromita brought up Microsoft and a lot of the things on HoloLens that students can read about and can view. We do have a Space Act agreement with Microsoft, that was developed as an annex for SUITS, for our challenge in particular that helps connect the HoloLens division with our technical community, but also provides, you know, opportunities to collaborate with them and work with them in making SUITS an even more enriching challenge. But that doesn't mean that we only ask students to use a HoloLens. It's open for them to select any augmented reality platforms, head mounted displays, peripherals that they choose to use. We've had teams with Magic Leap. We've had teams using Haptic Glove from another company that was integrated. And so, it's very much open. And there's lots of resources out there. And we're always looking for ways that we can include those resources in our virtual course that we enroll the students in as a start in December usually every year. So, just lots of great things for them to learn more and be prepared.  Host: I love that. You know, if you're kind of overwhelmed by saying, \"Man, this is so cool. How do I get involved?\" that there is just a plethora of resources for you to explore? Brandon, anything else that you'd like our audience to know, for those who might be curious and want to participate in SUITS? Something to look out for, some date to put on their calendar, some skill that you think would be valuable to participate with NASA, something that you'd like our audience to know?  Brandon Hargis: One of the things I would point out too is that over the past three years, and now working on our fourth year, is we've worked with over 50 different institutions across the United States this year, from Puerto Rico all the way out to the west coast in California, and north, south. So, this challenge is open to all U.S. institutions and we look forward to seeing those proposals coming in. The other thing we're very proud of is the number of minority serving institutions that are involved in our challenge. This year we received 40% of our proposals came from minority serving institutions. Last year, that number was around 34%. 10% had historically been from community colleges. We've reached over 25 states. I want to say the number is somewhere between 26 and 30 at this point, and Puerto Rico. And so, we're very happy that we're getting the word out, that we're open to all of these students to come and participate and bring those diverse ideas and backgrounds to the challenge. It only makes our challenge better. It only makes those solutions better. If I could point to anything coming up that students out there that are listening, or faculty or those who are just interested and want find a way to participate, we are having our test week in April, on the 23rd. There'll be exit pitches provided by the students that will recap their work and tell more about the solutions that they've created. We expect that that will be open for attendees as part of a Microsoft live event that will be hosted by our team. We'll have a panel of experts involved. Times and dates for that will be released at a later point. But you can always follow the NASA STEM Engagement Twitter account where that information will go out and probably be posted among other NASA social media accounts as well. But look for that to come up in April. And you can see the work that the students are doing and see how you might be able to get involved with SUITS in the upcoming challenge for 2022.  Paromita Mitra: So, in summary, I would just say that SUITS is an incredible opportunity for students to get involved, both from a software development perspective and really enhancing your skills from that angle. But then also, I think the humans in aerospace, the human spaceflight problem really presents a cross disciplinary problem space for a lot of different educational backgrounds to be involved in. And so, I know that personally for me, design team experience in undergrad and graduate school was pivotal in the some of the skills I've translated into my career today. And so, I'm glad and honored to be a part of SUITS and really enable other students to learn in the field of augmented reality and human spaceflight.

                        "description": "Pat Ryan (Host): Houston, we have a podcast. Welcome to the official podcast of the NASA Johnson Space Center, Episode 174, “Sticking the Landing on Mars.” I'm Pat Ryan. On this podcast we talk with scientists, engineers, astronauts, all kinds of experts about their part in America's space exploration program. And today, we take the next step in our “Mars Monthly” series. And we've talked about how to get a spaceship full of human astronauts to Mars, what they'd have to pack, how we would feed them along the way and when they got to their destination. Well, today we talk with two members of the Mars architecture team about the considerations for completing a successful landing of a spaceship on Mars. The subject is EDL, which stands for Entry, Descent, and Landing, not edit, decision, list. We have two guests. Doug Trent from NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama, is the Mars architecture teams Entry, Descent and Landing lead. Doug has been working on the Artemis Human Landing System program, HLS, for three years. So, he's tied in to how what we're learning from Artemis at the Moon is feeding into the development of the systems to use on Mars. Our second guest is Alicia Dwyer Cianciolo from the NASA Langley Research Center in Hampton, Virginia. She is the de-orbit descent and landing mission segment lead for the HLS and a member of the EDL team for NASA's Space Technology Mission Directorate. Alicia has been embedded with the Mars architecture team for years and has served on several Science Mission Directorate robotic mission teams. She actually has firsthand experience landing something on Mars. She was on console during the Mars Curiosity landing in 2012 and the Insight mission landing in 2018. On this first Friday, our eighth episode on how to get to Mars. Here we go.  [ Music]  Host: In listening to the “Mars Monthly\" series, I've learned so much about a number of aspects, what it takes to complete a successful trip to Mars, the emphasis is on successful. And I've come to realize more clearly how hard this is going to be. How much has to go right. How much smaller is the margin of error than it is for flights closer to home. But today we're focusing on one critical aspect, landing a spacecraft with humans onboard on the planet Mars. So, for both of you -- and Doug, if you’d start us off -- what makes landing on Mars so challenging?  Doug Trent: Yeah, sure. So, a lot of times you hear about the seven minutes of terror and that seven minutes of terror really refers to the rough amount of time that's required for our vehicles to go from atmospheric, entry interface, basically, where the vehicle just starts to enter the Martian atmosphere, all the way to touchdown. Like everyone else, we're basically watching the vehicle perform the landing sequence autonomously, however, because it takes anywhere from five to 20 minutes to receive those signals from Mars, we typically only get information about the landing after it's actually already physically happened on the surface of Mars. So, a lot of us are really just sitting there, almost in terror, clenching our fists, hoping that the landing went as planned. You know, so Alicia has some details that she can share on that too.  Alicia Dwyer Cianciolo: Yeah, having been able to have the opportunity to sit through two landing sequences, you can hold your breath for seven minutes. It's a little terrifying. But, you know, we spent about eight years for the Mars Science Laboratory, designing that seven minutes, with a large group across the agency and with different companies. So, you know, a lot of -- a lot of design and work goes into just those seven minutes making sure that we -- we get it right.  Host: And there are some terrific videos that have been made too, to give us the look at what that probably is like, as it's actually happening, that the seven minutes part of it is the amount of time it takes for the vehicle to actually make the transit through the atmosphere to the surface, is that right?  Alicia Dwyer Cianciolo: Correct.  Host: And it's terrifying because -- for you because you have to wait or because of what the vehicle is going through in the process?  Alicia Dwyer Cianciolo: Both. So, a lot of what we -- try to plan for all the things that we know the vehicle will encounter. And then we try to design additional robustness and margin into all the things that we -- know we don't know as well as the things that we don't know, we don't know.  Host: Right.  Alicia Dwyer Cianciolo: You know, we -- by the time it gets to the surface, we have to make sure that, you know, we've accounted for all of those. And you never know until it actually happens if -- we did it. So, as many times as, you know, that we've sent the rovers, every time, it's a different set of scenarios and a whole different environment that you encounter. So, we never really know until we get that signal back that says, it's landed.  Host: There's lots of different kinds of science that are involved for you guys to figure all this out. And so, one of my questions, Alicia would be, how did you get interested in this line of work in the first place, I mean, what kind of paths of your interests or education and experience brought you here?  Alicia Dwyer Cianciolo: So, one of the things that got me interested was in 1997, NASA landed the first rover, Sojourner, on the Fourth of July, and I was in college at the time trying to decide what I wanted to do after I got out of undergrad. And I started watching it. It was one of those first missions where you could, you know, track its progress every day on the internet. And the things that it would learn each day, it was like Christmas, the new -- the new rocks it would explore.  Host: Right.         Alicia Dwyer Cianciolo: The new places it would go was the first time we'd ever got to see that. And it got me interested in, hey, that would be something really fun to do. And so, when I got out of undergrad, decided to go to -- switch from physics to engineering as a major. One of the programs that I looked at was the George Washington University where you could take classes at a NASA research center and work on projects like this. And here it was about five years later, I was hired into this -- the same branch at the center who worked on delivering that mission to the surface.  Host: Outstanding. Doug, what about you? Give me a brief tour of your education and experience?  Doug Trent: Yeah, so for me kind of like Alicia, actually, it certainly wasn't planned, it was more just kind of walking along the path as it presented itself. So, I mean, as a child, I grew up, my parents would always put me in front of the TV to watch, you know, space shuttle launches and things like that to try and keep me interested and excited in space. But as I went through school and got into college, as I was working on my undergraduate degrees, I really didn't have that much of an interest of getting into space, it wasn't necessarily I didn't have an interest, as much as I didn't really think I had the capability to do it. It wasn't until I got my first opportunity to really get involved with space, interning at the Marshall Space Flight Center, basically doing life support systems development, testing for the space station. Doing that work really showed me like, oh, wow, I can actually do this. And this is absolutely amazing work that everybody's doing. And I really wanted to be a part of it. And so, that really kicked off the next roughly six-year journey for me going through finishing my undergraduate work in mechanical engineering, and then moving forward into my graduate studies at the Georgia Institute of Technology where I focused on systems engineering. And so basically, that focus on systems engineering is what's really led me to where I am today, you know, supporting the Mars architecture team doing Entry, Descent and Landing lead. So basically, taking a step back from the mechanical engineering roots that I started with, and really focusing on that big picture. You know, landing on Mars obviously takes a lot of different things happening in concert all at once to get the job done. And so, having that systems engineering background, to be able to take a step back and really look at all the components that are playing into this, just really, that background helped me get to where I am today, but also, I just have found this really strong love of, you know, looking at the really big picture instead of the nitty gritty detail. And so, that's a little bit of how I got to where I am right now.  Host:  Terrific. Now, you know, most aspects of human spaceflight come with various elements of risk, when we're trying to do something that the human body is not built to do naturally on its own. Alicia, you've got experience landing a vehicle on Mars, so you're conversant with some of those risks. But I wonder what risks are there that, you know, robotic mission are things that you can accept, that you would not accept for landing a vehicle that has human beings onboard?  Alicia Dwyer Cianciolo: Yeah, it's a very challenging problem. They are -- they're not the same. And I'm really now, just now starting to appreciate the differences for what it takes to accommodate crew onboard. But really, want to break this down a little bit because, you know, we have the difference between landing robotic and human missions, but there's really understanding the way that we -- we've landed the robotic missions, and so far or for the past two decades, NASA has sent really two classes of missions to -- robotic missions to Mars. Lander missions. And there's the 300-kilogram landers, which is kind of Mars Pathfinder, Spirit and Opportunity, Phoenix and Insight. And then there's the Curiosity rover and the 2020, Perseverance rover that are both about 900 kilograms. So, that's a three times increase in mass. And we had to change a lot of technologies just to get -- just to deliver, you know, that three times more massive vehicle.  Host: More so than just tripling up whatever you had done?  Alicia Dwyer Cianciolo: Right? It doesn't -- it doesn't just scale --  Host: OK.  Alicia Dwyer Cianciolo: -- the way you would expect it to. So, through the analysis we determined that we couldn't use the technologies like the airbags or the small retrorockets that Spirit an Opportunity used, we needed a bigger heat shield, that entry -- that protect it during entry. In fact, we had -- we built the biggest one, we could fit into the buildings, right? We had this limitation. But you know, now that we're talking about sending humans to Mars, we have to completely rethink those technologies. The parachutes aren't big enough to deliver the large masses that we need. So, just going from the 300 kilograms up to the 900 required us to change quite a few elements in our technologies. And then thinking about, you know, what it's going to take to deliver humans and, you know, now we're talking maybe 20 metric tons of payload.  Host: Wow.  Alicia Dwyer Cianciolo: We can't even -- right, even the things that we wanted -- that we designed and upgraded for the Curiosity and Perseverance rovers, you know, now we can't use the parachutes, we can't use the retro rockets, we need something different. And so, we're looking at what it would take to do that. And it's a whole bunch of different technologies like, inflatable structures, and, but they still have to fit into launch vehicles. So now, when you add crew, we can't have things like I mentioned, the parachutes, when it deploys, it results at a very high g load on the vehicle. So, like up to nine or 10 g's, which crew doesn't want to have to experience. So, we're looking at ways to redesign the entry guidance’s and entry vehicle path through the atmosphere to reduce those g's to something that the crew can survive. Plus, it's also a little bit much -- much more comfortable ride on the way in. So, it's those kinds of things that we have to take into account. Especially when you have crew on -- crew onboard.  Host: I didn't realize that the difference would be quite so big if you went from like 900 kilograms to 20 metric tons. But in both cases, you're trying to land a payload safely. It's just that one of them has living people onboard. The other one, it has a robotic payload. Is there a significant kind of difference in how you work out those risks or is it a completely different set of calculation?  Alicia Dwyer Cianciolo: Well, one of the other primary differences is that with all the robotic missions that we've tried to land, they -- several of them have been ballistic. So, which means, you know, we don't control them on entry. And so, we land where you land and that usually requires very large, flat rock free areas, so hundreds of kilometers in diameter. And so, we don't get to pick exactly where it lands, for Curiosity, we -- and then for Perseverance, we will be able to -- we were able to steer it much -- the first time we had a guided entry for those vehicles. And we were able to reduce that hundred-kilometer diameter footprint on the surface, you know, where we -- it could have landed down to about 10 kilometers in diameter. So the difference for -- when we add crew onboard is that now, the crew isn't going to want to walk very far to get their stuff and what the architecture setup is that we deliver all of the vehicle, all the crew logistics, their supplies and their ascent vehicle and everything before they ever get there. So, they know it's safe on the surface.  Host: So, now you have a -- you have a matter of trying to target the landing of your human crew close to their supplies, which you've sent on ahead.  Alicia Dwyer Cianciolo: Right, exactly. They don't want to walk very far to get there. So now instead of landing in ellipses where we think, you know, we can get there within 10 kilometers in diameter, we're now talking about landing in something that's one kilometer in diameter. And even the way that the technologies that allow us to do that, we're actually still developing. They're the precision landing sensors, where you have to put them, when they have to turn on so that we can actually see, you know, where you're trying to go and where you're targeting on the surface.  Host: Now, I understand that the actual spacecraft that's going to land people on Mars has not yet been designed. Doug, is it possible to give me a sense of how big or how heavy you think that vehicle is going to be? Or compare it to what's already been landed on Mars?  Doug Trent: Yeah, absolutely. So, I noticed that a lot of what you were saying before, you know, you were shocked a little bit about how much mass that we're saying it might cost. And a lot of that comes from the fact that humans tend to be pretty needy payloads, there's a lot of stuff that they need to be able to survive in the environment base on Mars. Things like life support systems, you need water to drink, you need food to eat.  Host: Right.  Doug Trent: You need someplace to live and sleep and work out of, and so all these things come together to really increase the amount of mass that we really got to deliver to Mars compared to what we would need for a robot which, you know, typically doesn't need those things.  Host: Right.  Doug Trent: So, Alicia kind of alluded at it. Previous payloads landed on Mars, you know, we've had a couple hundred kilograms with a lot of our rovers. And recently, we've been, you know, putting down rovers that are upwards of one metric ton. But basically, a lot of our current study suggests that human class landers are going to require a capability to land roughly 20 times that, so on the order of 20, 25 metric tons, per lander, onto the lunar surface. And --  Host: So, it’s --   Doug Trent: These missions actually are going to, I was going to, well --  Host: What I was going to say, is that -- a similar number for the first vehicle, that's coming delivering supplies, as well as the one that's got the actual people in it?  Doug Trent: That's correct.  Host: OK.  Doug Trent: So, each Mars mission, right now that we look at, we're typically looking at around three 20-ton landers to do the mission. So, you'd have two landers delivering cargo before you land the third one with crew, and even that third crew lander is going to have some additional cargo on it.  Host: Right, right.  Doug Trent: So typically, when we're looking at these three lander architectures, the first one is going to land things like maybe your surface power systems, potentially some additional propellant for your ascent vehicle, that will actually take the crew off the surface. And then the second lander is right now, typically designated for that actual ascent vehicle. Because, you know, typically, we like to bring our humans back home after a mission.  Host: Right.  Doug Trent: And so, we have a full lander, typically dedicated to that vehicle that does that process to get them back off the surface of Mars. And then finally, the third one, once we've got everything in place, all the cargo, the landers, we've got, you know, our ascent vehicle, we've got a check out from it from Mars, it says it's ready to go, it can come off the surface with the crew, then we'll send our crew out and actually land them on the surface of Mars with again, another one of those 20 ton landers.  Host: Does the increased size or maybe the shape of the vehicle or something, does that make a difference in how -- in the degree of difficulty it is to land it softly, if -- we can say it that way?  Doug Trent: It does. So again, like Alicia was saying, you know, some of the previous technologies that were used for landing, some of those robotic rovers, like, airbags were basically, you know, they just go on a ballistic trajectory, they kind of bounce around and roll around on the surface and they land where they land, not terribly precise, if we're going to be landing multiple landers in a small area, so that they don't have to walk terribly far to get it. Obviously, that takes some different technology, as well as like she said, the parachutes tend to induce some pretty significant load on the vehicles during decent, those are so high that we really can't subject astronauts to those levels. So, we've got to come up with new technologies and new methods to basically land these kinds of payloads on Mars to support that. So currently, the designs that we use, what we're looking at is basically employing two key technologies to really help us scale these landers up to this new delivery mass that we need. So, the first technology that we employ is a Hypersonic Inflatable Aerodynamic Decelerator, HIAD for short, is typically what we call it. And basically, what it is, is it allows us to get a much larger diameter to do our initial entry deceleration in the launch vehicle constraints that we have. So basically, you know, we're fixed on diameter based on the launch vehicle that we fly on maybe, in some cases, it might be an 8.4-meter SLS fairing --  Host: But you're talking about the diameter of the vehicle itself, the part of it, that is going to be leading the way through the atmosphere?  Doug Trent: Correct. But actually, what we'll do is we'll inflate large toroidal type sections of the vehicle that kind of come out and deploy to get a vehicle diameter that's much larger than the primary structure of the vehicle upwards of 16 meters. And so, that's going to give us the surface area basically to slow down initially, when we start impacting the atmosphere, and that'll help slow it down. Not as fast, so we don't induce those huge loads that we would see via a traditional parachute.  Host: You mean you're going to ease on the brake? You mean you're going to ease on the brake?  Doug Trent: Right.  Host: Instead of slamming it.  Doug Trent: Ease on the brake. Got to be nice to our human payload.  Host: Right, OK.  Doug Trent: The second component, obviously is going to be -- we don't want to rely on just an inflatable airbag approach where we bounce on the surface and roll around because it's just not going to be a very conducive way of landing sensitive payloads, but also humans. And so, the second component is basically a supersonic retro propulsion technology. And basically, what that's going to do is once we've extracted as much energy as we can, by using the thin atmosphere that does exist on Mars to slow the vehicle down, we're going to have to do a little bit more to make sure that we get that soft touch down, similar to like what we had in the Apollo days with a -- you know, a soft touchdown in the lunar lander on the lunar surface.  Host: Right.  Doug Trent: And so basically, what we have is this supersonic retro propulsion component of the landing system that will basically perform the last little bit of propulsive work to basically get that very soft touchdown on the surface.  Host: Neat. Alicia, are there other technologies that you guys are trying to incorporate into this that you didn't have for the robotic landers?  Alicia Dwyer Cianciolo: Absolutely, in order to meet our precision landing constraints, you know, so that the crew doesn't have to walk so far. We can deliver them without, you know, running into any other pre deployed assets.  Host: Right.  Alicia Dwyer Cianciolo: What we will use are a whole bunch of sensors. And right now, we're studying whether we can keep those sensors onboard the entry vehicle, or if we need to preplace beacons on the surface or in orbit. But essentially, what these sensors will do is, tell us where we're at and how fast we're going as we're flying in -- into the landing site. So, we have what we call terrain relative navigation sensors, which are cameras, that we take images of the surface as we're coming in and compare those to onboard surface -- onboard maps of the terrain, to tell us exactly where we are and how fast we're going. We also have, as we approach the landing site, we have a navigational -- Doppler lidar, which will tell us again, our velocity and altitude, and help arrange how far away we are from the site. And then as we get really close, we -- we're anticipating and right now advancing technologies so that we can have a lidar that will take an image of the surface right where we want to land and tell us where the rocks and the hazards are, so that we can basically avoid them with the hazard detection sensor. And while none of these have flown on any of our vehicles, yet, Perseverance will be the first mission to demonstrate using the terrain relative nav system.   Host: Cool.  Alicia Dwyer Cianciolo: So yeah, we're testing these things now, so that we can expand on them and help for future -- help the future missions.  Doug Trent: I obviously am closely tied in with the Human Landing System that NASA is currently working as well. And so, our HLS partners are currently developing lunar lander systems as part of the Artemis program to land humans back on the Moon. Now, obviously, we like to try and invest in technologies that can be applicable in other places. And this is definitely these landing sensors and these precision landing systems is something that, you know, if we're going to build a sustainable lunar presence, being able to land multiple payloads, again, in a very tight area together, so that they don't have to walk far to go get their payloads on the lunar surface. That kind of technology is very directly applicable to here on Mars. And so, we actually have a lot of commercial partners currently developing lunar landers that are going to employ these kinds of technologies that will be directly applicable to, you know, future Mars missions too. So, it's definitely a great partnership that we have with commercial industry. It's something that not just NASA is doing all on our own, we definitely have support from you know, companies like SpaceX, or Blue Origin, Dynetics, all developing landers right now under the Human Landing System program to help further these technologies along with us.  Host: And it only makes sense to make the best use of all the knowledge that you have.  Doug Trent: Absolutely.  Host: The one thing -- in the things that you've described, there was one thing I was kind of listening for, and I didn't hear, how do you -- especially with the human landers, and you've talked about the reasons why you want to land it fairly close to all the supplies that have been sent ahead. But so, how do you steer that thing in order to get to that smaller target area? If you've got a large enough ship to be carrying the human crew of, we don't know how many yet, plus, whatever supplies you're bringing along, moving at that kind of speed, how do you, do you steer it to head it toward the site you've identified?  Doug Trent: Right, so it's definitely a lot of planning ahead of time, before we go and actually initiate any kind of descent. Obviously, there's always going to be a little bit of uncertainty in terms of how exactly do my engines fire? Do they fire for the exact amount of time that I, you know, have commanded to do so? And so, those are going to introduce some errors. But you know, making sure that, you know, we have technologies and components in place that can basically execute the command as we tell them to do so, so that we get nearly as close to what we predict. Now, obviously, like I said, there's variations and so, we do have secondary, basically reaction control systems. It's basically a second propulsion system on the vehicle that basically will provide control of the vehicle during these key descent maneuvers. So, both during the aerodynamic deceleration, but also during the final retro propulsion. The second propulsion system helps orient the vehicle as it's doing these maneuvers to make sure that we stay on track as we go in for our final descent landing. And all of this is getting informed and happening in concert with these precision landing technologies, all of the -- the optical observations that you know, cameras are taking pictures of we've got maps of Mars that are pre-loaded onto the vehicle so that what it's seeing and what it expects to see it can try and line those up. And all this is happening -- in concert to make sure that we get those very precise landings that we need to really execute these missions.  Host: And so, it seems -- sounds to me, like the biggest part of that steering is to be aimed properly when you launch at the right place and at the right time.  Doug Trent: Absolutely.  Host: There have been ten -- if I've got that right, there were ten, successful landings of payloads on Mars from Earth, I don't know how many from other planets, but eight by the United States, two by the Soviet Union back in the ‘70s. Alicia, how valuable is the data from those uncrewed robotic missions? How -- successfully landing on Mars, how valuable is that data in helping you develop the current EDL plans?  Alicia Dwyer Cianciolo: It's very important, what it's helped us do is provided ten trajectories, paths through the atmosphere that tells us what the atmosphere is like at each of the different altitudes that we passed through. Now, granted, those are for a specific time, season, location. So, they -- they're a very limited data set. But for -- in some regions of the atmosphere, it's all the data that we have. What makes them even more valuable is that missions like Opportunity and Spirit and Curiosity, they've been on the surface at a location where we know exactly where they're at, for years. And most -- the rovers that are there all carry a science package that allows them to measure the density, temperature and pressures at the surface. And that really informs our -- some of our atmosphere models so that we can -- the orbiting spacecraft will be able to correlate data with that. It provides, so, there's two spacecraft right now, Mars Odyssey and Reconnaissance Orbiter, two U.S. spacecraft, and then there's the Mars Express, the European one that are taking data of the upper atmosphere all the time.  Host: OK.  Alicia Dwyer Cianciolo: And so, that we can correlate some of that data to the -- with the surface measurements, and then it can inform our model development and our -- that we use for the design of the future missions. So, there's some regions of the atmosphere where we just don't have any data. And that's, you know, we -- use that to inform future mission planning, as well as future mission design, what kinds of missions could we send, whether it's flying ones -- so there's a helicopter that's going to be flying on -- Mars 2020. That'll give us a new opportunity to look at different atmosphere in different regions that we haven't been able to at this point.  Host: And you're talking about meteorological conditions. The one that I know anything about is dust storms, we hear about dust storms on Mars a lot. What kind of challenge do you face if it's time to land on Mars and there's a big dust storm going on?  Alicia Dwyer Cianciolo: Well, until recently, we said we won't land if we're in orbit. [Laughter]  Host: We'll wait. [Laughter]  Alicia Dwyer Cianciolo: We'll try to wait it out. Right? And so, for most of the year, it is not global dust storm season. And so, that would be a reasonable assumption to make. There are times when you do get those global storms that do take months to decay. But what we -- what we've planned for so far is that you could stay in orbit and wait. The problem is really, it creates a level of uncertainty that we just haven't been able to understand and measure because just the atmosphere on a -- on a clear day is -- has uncertainty in it, and variability that we have to plan for. Adding in the additional complexity of a dust storm, which essentially, what it does is it heats up the atmosphere so that all the density is at the higher altitudes, and there's lower density near the surface. So, it just makes, you know, most of our models aren't set up to capture the full variability that that could entail, we don't have a lot of measurements during that. So, it's really just as an uncertainty in the mission design and planning that we would like to avoid. The other challenges that -- and some of the global storms where you just can't see the surface, it does make using those precision landing sensors a challenge. So, there are lots of things that we would like to avoid with that. The other challenge is that with our capability in our data that we have so far, we can -- we can forecast weather on the surface of Mars for about a day. That's about how good we can predict ahead. So, it would be OK if we were in a say a one soul, one day of Mars orbit around it and only took 11 hours to get once we deorbit from that -- from that to get to the surface, it would take 11 hours. We think we'd have a pretty good estimate of what the weather at the surface would be, where if we decided to be in a larger orbit, say a five soul or an orbit that takes five Mars days to go around, it would take a two and a half day -- days to get from, you know, once you deorbit back to the surface take two and a half days. Well, since we can't predict out that far, that also adds an additional uncertainty.  Host: Right.  Alicia Dwyer Cianciolo: We're trying to identify what -- what information we would need to improve those prediction models. So that, you know, would enable that kind of prediction capability for those types of missions. But right now, we would like to say we'd like to avoid landing in a dust storm. But if we had to, then we'd have to add additional robustness to the system in the way of extra propellant, or, you know, we'd have to -- we'd have to --  Host: To be able to wait.  Alicia Dwyer Cianciolo: Right.  Host: Yeah. One important part -- got to be an important part of the consideration for this has to be the location on the surface, like where on Mars do, we want to land? Doug, can you give me an idea of what are the characteristics of a good landing site or a perfect landing site?  Doug Trent: Yeah, so choosing a landing site is actually quite complex of a task. There's a lot of factors that go into play. For our -- for the robotic landers, the previous Mars missions, there's really always been a very clear science objective that's been defined in partnership with, you know, lots of NASA scientists. However, when landing humans on Mars, there's some other considerations that come into play. Obviously, we want to do science and things like that. But one of the largest things that has to be defined is, you know, what are we going to do when we get there? Are we going there because we want to do human exploration? And so, in that case, we might be landing in one spot want to do some scientific exploration in that area and then land in a completely different area on the planet to do science exploration somewhere else. That's one way. Another one might be if I'm hoping to develop a longer-term human presence, maybe a Mars colony perhaps, the latter, so that Mars colony is going to require a site rich in raw resources, which can be refined to use -- and utilized for further developing the colony. So, things like ice so that we have water developed. And we can convert that into air to breathe, you might need, you know, a site rich in specific minerals and things like that, that I can refine into resources to actually build structures and things like that. So outside of these questions obviously, there's also the performance related part of it. So, in terms of selecting the landing site, not all landing sites are the same in terms of how they impact the design of our vehicle. So, things like surface condition, how soft or how hard is the surface that we're going to be physically landing on? How many rocks and boulders are there? And how far are they dispersed or how close are they together in the potential landing zone? What's the slope, the elevation of the local terrain? Is it you know, perfectly flat? Or maybe is it kind of like a little foothill that we're landing near or maybe even on? All these play a role in the design of the actual lander itself. However, basically, landing is not the only component. So obviously, we're here talking about how we -- how do we stick the landing? But unfortunately, taking it back on a more systems perspective, landing isn't the only component. So obviously, with our crew, like I said earlier, we want to bring them home. And so, ascent is another portion of the mission, very important part of the mission to get our crew home. And unfortunately, the landing site selection and how that impacts the ascent vehicle, might not be the same as how it impacts the descent system. And so, you know, for instance, in terms of the landing vehicle, I would prefer the land -- the landing system at as low altitude as possible. And that's mainly because I'll get a more dense atmosphere, it allows me to slow down better. And so, I can have less propellant, basically. However, the ascent system would prefer to land on top of the highest mountain possible, because that just puts me that much closer to orbit, which then it requires less propellant. So really --  Host: But then you'd have to walk down the mountain, you have to walk that mountain to get to it.  Doug Trent: Yeah, absolutely. And so, it's just basically highlighting the fact that there's this trade amongst the various different components so that the lander isn't the only component in a Mars mission, there's a lot of other things that go into place. And so, for me, an ideal landing spot would be something that's flat, has a nice hard surface, so I don't have to worry about my landing gear sinking into like a really dusty surface or something like that.  Host: Right.  Doug Trent: Large enough that I can land several vehicles in close proximity. So, like you said, top of a mountain, probably not a good idea. And really only a small amount of smaller rocks. So, I don't have to worry about maybe a landing gear, you know, hitting a large boulder or something like that, or maybe a larger rock that puts me in a weird tilt when I land or something like that would be not ideal. And lastly, I'd like it to be close to at least some useful resources, particularly something like water ice, that can be useful for, you know, life support, drinking and things like that.  Host: Particularly if it's an early mission, where you're going to have to be setting things up from scratch.  Doug Trent: Right.  Host: You don't want to have to go far to get them.  Doug Trent: That's, that's true.  Host: I can understand as you say it that there are so many different things to take into account that it's -- where you want to land is not a simple answer. And, one of the big parts of it, as you noted, is that it depends on what you want to do there. So, that's all part of the stuff that you guys have still got work to do to figure out in the years to come. One thing we didn't talk about that I want to now, as we've considered all these elements, and kind of try to synthesize it, is to flesh out the human detail for me. If we all three were strapped into the Mars vehicle and headed down for the surface, Doug, can you give me a sense of what it would look like, and sound like and feel like as we rode through the Martian atmosphere to the surface?  Doug Trent: Yeah, so unfortunately, I have not had the chance to fly on a space shuttle or maybe land on the Moon.  Host: Yeah. Not yet.  Doug Trent: Yeah, not yet, maybe someday. So, it is a little bit challenging to say how it might look and sound inside the vehicle. But we can definitely make some educated assumptions or guesses on how that might look. So obviously, the design of the crew cabin is going to have a huge impact on what it physically looks like and sounds like, you know, the materials that it's made of, how big it is, all these things are going to play a role in how that might happen. However, with the design of the current Entry, Descent, Landing system, there is a bit that we do know that it's going to be similar to. Based on the design that we have right now, it's going to be very similar to both a shuttle landing and a lunar landing, you kind of get components of both. So, this is because, you know, like I said, the initial parts, were definitely entering an atmosphere, going very, very fast. And so, you've got that component very similar to a shuttle, how it reenters the Earth's atmosphere, obviously, it's going hypersonic and so, you're going to get plasma buildup and things like this. So, any kind of windows that you might have, you're going to see just fireballs out the windows, similar to any kind of reentry during Earth. So, we would expect to see similar kinds of events while landing on Mars, and, of course, the sounds that would accompany those kinds of things. However, unlike a shuttle reentry and landing, the shuttle lands -- basically glides down back to the surface and lands on the runway. However, like we were talking about, again, we're going to have a hypersonic retro propulsion, supersonic retro propulsion system, where we have to basically turn on engines to do the final little bit of landing. So, that's where basically the more like a lunar landing component comes in. So obviously, we're going to have the sounds of you know, pumps spooling up to start moving propellant, you're going to have engines igniting, all the good sounds that comes with a loud, powerful, rocket engine igniting and so, you'll have that component as well, that's maybe a little bit different than the shuttle system. Now, the crew is going to experience acceleration similar to those experienced by the shuttle astronauts. And that's not just random, that's by design. We obviously have a very good understanding of the limitations of the human body under acceleration and have designed the lander and the descent profile to basically provide that environment such that it's not too extreme for the astronauts. However, we are still working with our medical community on the -- finer details. So, things such as seating orientation, you know, are they going to be sitting upright like we sit in a chair here on earth? Or is it going to be -- or is it going to be more of an inclined position to better accommodate the acceleration load? So, for instance, you know, we might lean them back at some kind of angle to put their back towards the vehicle so that we have a good, large surface on their body to impart some potentially higher loads. So, things like this, we haven't really nailed down yet, and it's still under study, but we're obviously working with the various communities necessary to kind of flesh these details out.  Host: One of the things that it occurs to -- me you'll also, when working with the medical community, you got to consider the fact that these astronauts who are about to land, have been in a weightless environment for many, many months now. And they may be a lot weaker than -- than they were when they launched.  Doug Trent: Yeah, that's absolutely correct. I mean, right now, the missions that we're looking at, it could take months, basically, to get the astronauts to Mars. And, you know, we've seen from astronauts coming back from the space station all the time, you know, they'll land wherever they land. And typically, we have a whole host, a whole crew of people from Earth to help them out of the vehicle and move them to, you know, whatever transport vehicle to move on after they've landed. That's something we're not going to have on Mars. And so, that deconditioned state of the astronauts, when they get to Mars is certainly a very large concern that we have -- ideally, they'll be able to get out of their chairs, the size of these landers and how tall they are, they're likely going to have to probably crawl down a ladder or something of that sort to be able to get to other assets that might be on the surface, like a rover or other payloads like this. So, a lot of it right now, the approach is, well, when they land on the surface, we'll give them a certain amount of period, maybe it's a few days or a week or so to basically conditioned to that new environment, basically the Mars gravity, to hopefully, give their bodies enough time to at least kind of get their walking legs back underneath them to basically execute the mission.  Alicia Dwyer Cianciolo: But that's a good point. So, what -- so, that means that the -- whatever they land in has to have everything that they need to live for that amount of time.  Host: Right.  Alicia Dwyer Cianciolo: And we've talked about being able to maybe just deliver the crew in something like an Orion capsule, or you know, something, a smaller vehicle, and then have them get out, but because of this deconditioned crew environment that they will be in, we do need to have them land in something that's got all the things that they will need to live for that long before transferring.  Host: Right. Alicia, you've already landed robotics on Mars before. Have you thought what it'd be like the first time you can land something that's got human beings inside of it?  Alicia Dwyer Cianciolo: You know, back when the movie “The Martian” came out, they had all these different ideas of how to, you know, as we're designing these and we're looking at, you know, how can we use our imaginations to figure out how all the different parts could be interchangeable? Or if something did go wrong, how would, you know, address that? You know, so it's, you know, getting out and looking for the first time, this new planet that we haven't ever, you know, looked at with our with human eyes, we've done it with robotic eyes a lot of times and try to just imagine what that would be like, I think it comes back to the engineers on also imagining, you know, what could go wrong with the systems that we're building and how we could, you know, make sure that -- they're robust to a wider range, because we just don't know what it's going to be like. So that's -- that's part of the challenge and it's also part of the fun.  Host: Yeah, to be able to figure out how to do something that people have been thinking about doing for generations. It's got to be a really cool job to have. Alicia and Doug, this has been terrific to hear your perspective on this. Thank you, very much, and good luck, with the work.  Alicia Dwyer Cianciolo: You're welcome.  Doug Trent: Thank you.  [ Music]  Host: I recently saw the episode of the streaming series, in which the crew module with five astronauts onboard made its descent through the Mars atmosphere. And they did, I thought, a pretty good job reflecting the seven minutes of terror that those humans landing on Mars are going to live through on their way to history. Great talk today, to get some level of detail and see what the NASA engineers and scientists are working through to develop the systems that will safely put our astronauts down on the planet Mars in the years to come.

                        "description": "Gary Jordan (Host): Houston, we have a podcast. Welcome to the official podcast of the NASA Johnson Space Center, Episode 178, “International Trailblazer.” I'm Gary Jordan and I'll be your host today. On this podcast we bring in the experts, scientists, engineers, and astronauts all to let you know the coolest information about what's going on the world of human spaceflight. More than 20 years ago, on November 2, 2000, a crew of three spacefarers arrived at the International Space Station with the mission to bring the new orbital complex to life. We call these missions Expeditions and the International Space Station crew was Expedition 1. The trio was NASA's William Shepherd, commander of Expedition 1, and Russian cosmonaut Sergei Krikalev and Yuri Gidzenko, both seasoned veterans of long duration missions aboard the Russian Space Station Mir that was in orbit at the time. These three spent 136 days aboard the space station and set the course for what would be an unbroken streak of human presence in space. We often like to tout that if you're, I guess at this point, younger than 20, you've never lived in a world where there haven't been humans in space at any given point in your life. So, we had a chance to chat with Bill Shepherd, the commander of Expedition 1, about what it took to get to this point last year around the date of the anniversary. On this episode we're bringing in a different perspective from Sergei Krikalev, a decorated cosmonaut who was instrumental in U.S. and Russian cooperation. He paved the path for cooperative space shuttle missions, and he was on both the first crewed visit and the first long-term expedition aboard the International Space Station itself. So, let's learn more about how this international trailblazer helped to kick off 20 years of continuous human habitation on the space station. Here's Sergei Krikalev. Enjoy.  [ Music]  Host: Sergei Krikalev, thanks so much for coming on Houston We Have a Podcast after reaching 20 years of continuous human presence.  Sergei Krikalev: Thank you. It's a good program and good moment. I remember every moment of our preparation and flight on Expedition 1.  Host: That's right. Well, let's start there Sergei. We've made it, 20 continuous years since you've entered the International Space Station. What are your first thoughts before we begin here, your first thoughts of reaching this milestone?  Sergei Krikalev: Actually, maybe I will correct you a little bit because small base of the station, we entered almost two years before, in 1998. The first two elements of the station where docked together and I would like it to be on shuttle flight STS-88 to be part of this mission when we docked those two elements of the station, we opened hatches and we did some maintenance of the station. So actually, for me the hatch opening was together with Bob Cabana, commander of STS-88, and we together entered through Node [1] first, and then to FGB [Zarya] to start the duration on the station. And my first thought was that station is really small, it was just very beginning. We just assembled those two elements of the station. But at that time, I was already assigned as a crew member of Expedition 1 and I know that we visited this station, we worked on this station for relatively short period of time shuttle, but I knew that next step would be longer duration flight on the station sometime later. So, at the end of the year 2000, we flew Expedition 1 from dock with service module [Zvezda] and start preparation on the station. And some [inaudible] work that station is empty because I used to fly Mir station and with time station filled with equipment, with spare gear, with airducts, everything. So, station became kind of busier place. But when we came to the station everything was empty; we had several [air] ducts stored there, and even table was not there. So, we flipped on lights and I remember myself thinking that for the first time, we flipping lights and probably now the flights would be on for a long, long period of time.  Host: So, you did understand then the gravity of what you were accomplishing for Expedition 1. You already mentioned that this was not the first time that you opened up the hatches to the International Space Station, you were there before on STS-88, entering at the same time as Bob Cabana. But, understanding the gravity of what you were doing on Expedition 1, essentially setting the stage for continuous human presence. At the time, did it strike you that you would essentially be turning on the lights for welcoming the crews for the next, I guess, right now 64 long duration expeditions?  Sergei Krikalev: Now, we never even thought, you know, how expedition was going to be counted, because there was period of time when one flight had two expeditions in one mission, because there was kind of overlapping one expedition over another. But I remember myself, that actually, every spaceflight is very exciting moment and a very important moment of your life or space program because every flight is significant to them. But after having this experience of joint missions, mission -- joint missions from Mir with our international partners, joint mission on shuttle when I was participant of this mission, mission specialist from this mission, I knew that we were going to start something very exciting because we had very good team who build the station, to prepare this station for flight, who prepare cosmonauts and astronauts for flying on the station. So, we knew that it was the beginning of some very exciting program.  Host: You mentioned there was already a little groundwork here. You yourself were part of the first steps of this cooperation, what would lead up to the cooperation on the International Space Station, but you did spend a significant amount of time on Mir and you did mention some of your time on the space shuttle. First, talk about some of your time on Mir. You already mentioned that the International Space Station seemed a bit empty compared to Mir.  Sergei Krikalev: Actually, my first entry of the station, Mir station was during Expedition 4 on Mir, and at that time, record setting Expedition, Expedition 3, was flying the station and they were supposed to stay on the station for a year. That's 366 days, leap year. So, a crew of Expedition 3 would leave there and we arrive as international Expedition, we came with French cosmonaut Jean-Loup Chrétien and we entered the station and I remember opposite feeling, how big is the station, with docks with spare parts, with food, with clothing. So, when we opened the hatch it was difficult to actually go through all this stuff to get to main module of the station at that time. And station was very small. It was also only built from two modules at that time. So, that was my first experience, it was very interesting, very exciting, and my first experience of international cooperation in space. But second flight was even more exciting because we also started the international expedition flight with British cosmonaut Helen Sharman. We were supposed to do several EVA and build big section outside of the station. So, it was a really exciting program for us as a cosmonaut. And we were supposed to finish this mission at the end of year 1991 as Expedition 9 on the station. But in the middle of the flight decisions were made for me. My partner come back home, but I stayed another mission on Mir station. So, I flew two expeditions in one flight, Expedition 9 and Expedition 10. And we came back almost 11 months after like in the spring of 1991.  Host: That's right, you were in space for a long time, well over 300 days, 311 I think, was the count on that mission. What did you learn about what it takes to live and work in space for that long?  Sergei Krikalev: Actually, the flight was long, so we learned a lot of things. And for me, it was second flight. So, I found that experience for second flight is little different than first one, because when you fly first time, you usually fly with a more experienced crew member. But when you fly second time, usually you have unexperienced crew member with you, and you have more responsibility on orbit. That's [inaudible] what we have an experienced crew member. That's the first part. The second part that when I arrived to the station, station had two more modules docked to the station in compare with my first flight, and I found myself actually, on learning curve again. So, we need to -- we learn everything on the ground, but still, we continue with learning process during flight. And, for my second flight, I had to kind of relearn some things because we have new hardware and new equipment, new setup, and it was interesting for me to compare how I learned new things for me and how my partner learned everything from scratch basically, because for Anatoly Artsebarsky, for him, it was first flight. We learned that with experience you get more seasoned, but again, every time you fly you have new stuff -- new challenges and you do something different anyway, and for us it was very interesting set of EVAs. On that flight, on Expedition 9, we had six EVAs done in one flight. And actually, in second Expedition, I did another EVA. So, for that time it was seven EVA in one flight, and it was really challenging and really interesting. So, we did a lot of interesting experiments and usually sooner or later you face some problem and you realize that with some experience you can -- troubleshoot the problems during flight and you -- can do a lot of things yourself because in the beginning you rely more on your partner, you rely on the ground, but your experience, you became more and more self-sustainable, I would say. So, you're able to face the problem and solve the problem even if nobody can help you. So, for me, it was an interesting experience. And also, talking about changing mindset, I would say, really, like in sports, I very open, for me at least, it reminds me how if a sportsman is, running five miles. And of course, when you run you try to do your best and you spend as much effort as possible to be able to do as much as possible but to be able to finish this distance. So basically, what I learned from my coach in sport that you should come to the final line with no extra things. So, you can -- you spent all your capabilities during the meet. So, about the same approach I used for the flight. But when you realize that your distance is much longer, you have to change mindset and actually pace for your activity and especially to be able to finish longer distance. And it was really a change in mindset.  Host: Now, these are some critical lessons that even cosmonauts and astronauts today can learn from as we're doing these continuing expeditions on the space station, these 160-day, 200-day, sometimes more than 300-day missions on the International Space station, you had that experience even before Expedition 1. Were you sharing some of these lessons, such as, as you said, stretching out your energy, where you're sharing these lessons with your Expedition 1 crewmates?  Sergei Krikalev: Of course. And actually, I already mentioned it, that usually we combine the crew in such a way that we have a mixture of experience and not experience crew member. For Expedition 1, knowing that this mission is going to be critical, we had a lot of things that need to be done and need to be done on time. It needs to be done even if we have some malfunction [inaudible]. That's why all our crew, Expedition 1, were only from already flown crew members. Shepherd flew several times on shuttle. His total flight time was maybe not so long, but he has good experience, he had good experience of flying to space and solving the problem. Yuri Gidzenko had long duration flights behind him. I had actually two long duration flights and two short duration flights on shuttle. So, our crew was very experienced and the reason why we get together for this mission was because all of us had enough experience. And of course, we share these experiences together.  Host: Now, one experience on your end that I think is fascinating, you already mentioned your short duration missions on shuttle.  Sergei Krikalev: Right.  Host: It was, at least for STS-60 a first, a cosmonaut on a shuttle mission, and STS-88, this is the one where you actually visited the International Space Station.  Sergei Krikalev: And assembled.  Host: And assembled, that's right.  Sergei Krikalev: To assemble the station, not only visit.  Host: So, your impressions working with Americans and setting the stage for what would be continuing cooperation?  Sergei Krikalev: Actually, it was very interesting experience for me because, as you already know, I had the experience of Expedition 4, 9, and 10, on new station, so I knew everything, how it was done in our program, how we fly on Soyuz, how we operate in the station, how we do scientific experiments. And also, we had even some experience of doing international partnership because all flights new were already -- was already international. But difference was that on Mir and on Soyuz, we were first in the program and we had get on the station from other country. When I came for shuttle everything was opposite. I was guest in the system and of course my American colleagues knew some things much deeper than I could learn in this period of time. But, for me, what was interesting that when we had our international guests on the station, we were professionals in our area, and they were not professionals. But, in this case, I deal with professionals who are in their own environment and it was very interesting for me to see how training system done, how system integration done, how troubleshooting of malfunction is done in American program and in our program. So actually, we discussed it to work with our partner because I was very pleased to see very professional and very motivated people. And actually, during our training we actually, even mentioned it after training and after flight that we start to understand each other much earlier than we improve our language. I mean, English language on my side or maybe Russian language when Americans start to fly on ours, because as a professional we start to understand each other, as we said, sometimes better than some of our specialists because we actually, we did the productivity and we came in about the same way of the program because many people were professional -- already professionals in their area before they came to astronaut office. And they're professional pilots, professional engineers, professional scientists, and I was very pleased to work in this professional group of people.  Host: And you continued to work with a diverse group of international crews as you did International Space Station Expeditions, of course, Expedition 1, which the anniversary of which we just celebrated, and Expedition 11, where you were commander of the International Space Station. Can you talk about the differences between those two expeditions, elaborating more on Expedition 1, some of your mission objectives?  Sergei Krikalev: The mission objective for the station was to make station alive, because when we came to the station most of the system were in off mode and we needed to activate them, some systems we need to assemble, and some system was very difficult to assemble, because like some life support systems needed to be activated in a couple weeks, and if something happens, something goes wrong, and something we wouldn't be able to handle, and we wouldn't be able to activate the system. Some of scenarios were to terminate the mission and go back home. So, probably that's why our expedition were assembled from very experienced people already flown in space and being able to troubleshoot problems if we face this problem. And for us, what was very interesting, and it was interesting not only for us, it was very interesting even for engineers because usually, if we do some different parts of the station, for example, on our side we usually make them on the ground before flight, we usually check everything before we send it to space to be sure that things would work properly in space. But for Expedition 1, and actually even for mission STS-88, some parts of the system never saw each other on the ground. So, we did some connection only using engineering drawing or engineering experience, but really, some pieces were not really made on the ground before we made it in space. So, and actually, not everything worked smooth. Sometimes -- I remember we were trying to connect one connector and for some reason, there was a mistake in assembly, and we had to invent, recreate -- provide this connection. I remember, even on Russian side, we had also some problems with opening hatches because access with key for opening the hatches were built with mistake and we need to invent our own way how to still perform the task we need to perform. So, I remember we had malfunction on arriving Progress vehicle, cargo vehicle, that was coming to the station and it was not able to dock with us in automatic mode. So, Yuri Gidzenko and I needed to do this approach manually and still things were not very smooth, so we had to actually use not normal way to dock a coming vehicle to the station. So, we had a lot of very interesting and very challenging things. And what was interesting, what I remember from this mission, it was very interesting to see how, for example, new modules during our mission [inaudible] didn't fly our flight ourselves. We start flying on the station that's only three modules and actually only two of these modules were available for us in the very beginning. But then that shuttle would come and bring extra solar ray and we were able to provide power to the Node and open the hatch to the Node because before that the thermal conditions on -- in the Node were not be able to maintain. So, we needed to wait shuttle for to open hatch to another Node. And then I remember that another shuttle come with spacelabs, with the modules, flight 8 in our sequence, but the lab came to this flight and crew. We were very happy to see crew arriving to us and helping to assemble and make all necessary connections left. And lab was really empty. So, we started out with lab to make it’s really a lab and make it alive. So, the first -- the first Expedition was challenging, and it was interesting and I'm very happy that in spite of all problems that we had basically every day, we still were able to reach the goal and make station alive, what was basically prime goal for our Expedition.  Host: What an important way to kick off the International Space Station. I know you visited again for Expedition 11 in 2005. At the end of that expedition, you had accumulated more than 800 days in space. Here we are, 15 years later, and you're still third on the all-time record of time in space, behind Gennady Padalka and Yuri Malenchenko. Your thoughts on spending so much time in space and setting a record that still stands today.  Sergei Krikalev: Maybe a few words about Expedition 11. Unfortunately, Expedition 11 was also not very normal flight. Like Expedition 1 was unusual because it was certain we need to do everything for the first time. But then in 2003, after crash of shuttle, really a number of crew on the station from three to two people and it was very challenging also because for -- it's a really big station, it's a lot of tasks we need to do every day. We have -- we have only go to. And several expeditions flew with reduced crew to continue science, to continue life support on the station. And maybe another interesting part of this mission that for more than two years, shuttle didn't fly to the station, but Expedition 11 was Expedition when first shuttle after tragedy came to the station and we were very glad to see our colleagues on the station again. And station, after that flight, station start to continue assembly and out seeking for maintenance station in the final configuration. So, if we talk about -- yeah, because I remember, I was -- the record itself does not go for the flight. I -- before the flight, I mentioned that if everything goes normal and every time you don't feel that everything would be normal, but everything would be normal, like probably I received the longest, total time duration for record setting cosmonaut, it was Sergei Avdeyev, who flew 747 days, and I knew that I would be somewhere around 800, so probably I would break this record. But when mission control told me that today you're exceeding the previous record for total time in space, I remember we were joking saying, well, it's a very convenient record because today I broke Sergei Avdeyev's record, but tomorrow I will break my own today record, and it will be until the end of the flight. So, it was kind of interesting to know that every day was record-setting day. But, as I said, the record itself was not the goal, it was kind of side effect of this mission. But what was interesting that with this -- my sixth flight, it's very interesting to see what changed on the ground because from my first flight to sixth flight I was able to see some change on the ground, to see how some area start to be more [inaudible] on space. We have some places more developed from agricultural point of view. We saw that we obviously see some changes on the ground, connected sometimes with nature, sometimes with human activity. But another maybe interesting point that we are gaining experience and we knew that with experience of spaceflight we will need some time in the future, maybe not even tomorrow, maybe some time after tomorrow when we have to fly outside low-Earth orbit and we will need all our experience gained in all these 60 plus and maybe 70 plus Expedition on ISS with experience of shuttle flying, of Apollo missions, Skylab missions. All this experience we will need for future flight outside low- Earth orbit when we are going to fly to Moon and further out.  Host: That's very important Sergei and I want to end with this, given your experience and everything done for the International Space Station for what stands as 20 years of continuous human presence and cooperation, some final words of wisdom for those coming on to work for the future of Roscosmos, for NASA, and for space agencies around the world.  Sergei Krikalev: Maybe just for me it was a little bit upset moment when my manager said, well, let new guy fly a little bit, help them with preparation for the flight, helping the U.S. to build new vehicle. So, and I still not close to the issue of possible future spaceflights, but after my sixth flight I was working at Energia and I was working with head of training center, helping not only Russians, but also our international partners get ready for spaceflight. So, I think it's very important that previous generation or maybe people who already have experience in flight, continue transferring the experience for future Expeditions for future programs, future hardware developing, and that's the first part. And second part, what we learn from, what I learned from previous missions that much more efficient and actually much more interesting to do things together, because sometimes you know how to do things, but your partner can have alternate thought, and sometimes you can learn something from your friends and the more diversity we have for in our team, the more new capabilities you can have. So, I think it's very important that we learn how to do complicated things together and I think we can use this experience for future programs.  Host: Mr. Krikalev, wonderful words and thank you for taking the time to do this interview with me. Here we are crossing this great milestone, 20 years of continuous human presence on the International Space Station. It's been an honor to speak with you today. I appreciate your time. Thank you.  Sergei Krikalev: Thank you. [ Music]  Host: Hey, thanks for sticking around. I hope you enjoyed this conversation with Sergei Krikalev and learned a lot about what it took to get to that point of starting Expedition 1 and kicking off what would be 20 continuous years of human presence. We're not done yet. We're still going to be putting out more episodes on the 20th anniversary, because honestly, it kicks off a lot of the activities aboard the International Space Station. In fact, we got a collection of panels that we hosted for the 20th anniversary coming up. We'll kick that off next month, so visit our International Space Station collection. You can just search on whatever browser you prefer. Just search Houston We Have a Podcast, Space Station Episodes. There's a collection there and you can go to listen to any of those episodes in no particular order and stay tuned for some of those panels. So, it took a lot to get this episode out here in 2021, in January. This episode actually we recorded -- we had some issues with the audio itself and had to restore the audio. It took some time, we actually recorded this back in August of 2020, trying to set it up for the 20th anniversary, but it took some time. So, I want to say a big thanks to all the folks here, to Greg Wiseman and Pat Ryan, and to John Stoll, Alex Perryman, and a lot of the folks that helped to make this episode still a reality even though we had to restore it. It took a lot of effort and here we are putting it out now in 2021 and we're still keeping the conversation going about 20 continuous years, so. So, I'm glad we got to bring this to you today. You could check out this podcast and others at NASA.gov/podcasts and you can engage with us on social media. You know where we are, the Johnson Space Center pages of Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram and you can use the hashtag #AskNASA on any of those platforms to submit an idea for the show, and just make sure to mention it's for us at Houston We Have a Podcast.

                        "description": "Gary Jordan (Host): Houston We Have A Podcast. Welcome to the official podcast of the NASA Johnson Space Center, Episode 181, “Suit Up for Mars.” I'm Gary Jordan, and I'll be your host today. On this podcast, we bring in the experts, scientists, engineers, and astronauts. All to let you know what's going on in the world of human spaceflight. So, we're continuing our “Mars Monthly” series on first Fridays. Last month, we chatted with Dr. Paul Niles about Mars, the planet. Its atmosphere, the pressure, some of the dust storms. There's a lot that Mars will throw at humans exploring its surface. So, we have to be prepared with the right spacesuit. Luckily, we have a lot of smart people already thinking about how to address some of these issues. Things like those dust storms, mobility, and planetary protection. One of those smart people is Natalie Mary, a Systems Engineer for the Extravehicular Activity, or EVA Office. It's her job to perform analysis and integration for the exploration EVA system with suit engineers and stakeholders from programs such as Artemis, Gateway, and Mars. So, let's get right into it. Suiting Up for Mars with Natalie Mary. Enjoy.  [ Music]  Host: Natalie Mary, thanks for coming on Houston We Have a Podcast today.  Natalie Mary: Thanks for having me.  Host: What an interesting topic, Martian spacesuits, suiting up for working on the surface of another planet. It's a huge deal. Natalie, I want to start with just understanding what it takes to work in such an interesting field. How do you get to the point where you are, where you're thinking about how to live and work on Mars in a spacesuit?  Natalie Mary: Yeah, well, like most space nerds out there, I grew up looking at the sky and stars and imagining about exploration. And I mean, as a kid, I put together those little glow-in-the-dark constellations on the ceiling in my room. And I found I was decent at math and science and decided to go into engineering, like sort of engineering field. And so, I went to Texas A&M for a bachelor's in aerospace engineering. About the time I graduated in 2000, it was perfect because NASA was hiring flight controllers. So, pretty much as the ISS assembly began. So, I was a flight controller for about eight years. And I was very privileged to be a part of that. And then after that, I took on more of a like systems engineering kind of role and began working with the Extravehicular Activity Office. And so, my focus has been on systems engineering such as architecture, interfaces, OpsCons, for multiple missions including exploration spacesuit capabilities for lunar, cislunar and Mars missions. And so, my role has really been mainly on the architecture side of things, but to know that you need to know what folks want the suit to actually do on the surface of Mars. How the environment of Mars affects the design of the suit. What kind of architectures the suit interfaces with, like pressurized rovers or habitats. And so, that is what I'm doing currently. And by the way, it's kind of cool that you call this podcast, “Suit Up for Mars,” because we have a public website that you can go to at NASA.gov/suitup. And that has our Artemis generation spacesuits rollout, some really cool references and images, and we have a yearly EVA technology workshop that includes the presentations throughout the years for that.  Host: Nice. So, if you want to know more about just spacesuits in general, that's a good place to go. So, Natalie, why don't we start with that? Spacesuits in general. Give folks a sneak peek on what's on that website, and sort of what we're going to be talking about today. So, what are those things you have got to consider when you're designing a spacesuit? What are the things that a spacesuit provides that it's necessary for space exploration?  Natalie Mary: Yeah, yeah, so the spacesuit provides the crew member with the life support, environmental protection, and communications capability to allow EVAs outside of the vehicle, extravehicular activity outside of the vehicle in the vacuum of space or on a planetary surface. So, it's not just clothes or scuba diving equipment. For example, like if you're going to go scuba diving, you have your dive suit for thermal, your buoyancy control, masks and breathing air, dive computer, things like that. But with a spacesuit, that includes thermal protection and mobility and informatics, but it also protects you from vacuum by providing a pressure garment and oxygen and CO2 removal, communication, power, cooling water, drinking water, and waste management. All the things that you need to survive. And so, it's pretty much your own personal spacecraft.  Host: That's actually the best way that I've ever heard it being described, is your own personal spacecraft or like, a spacecraft shaped like a human body. That's essentially what it is, is doing all these things to, you know, separate all the needs or to give all the needs of what the human body is wanting within that environment. Because space or other planets, they just don't provide those needs, right?  Natalie Mary: Exactly.  Host: Yeah. Now, there's a couple things about, you know, spacesuits. You mentioned a couple when you were talking about your current work on thinking about what suit is going to be needed for Mars. And some of the things you brought up was, like, the architecture of Mars itself, right. What's going to be on the surface that the suit is going to need to interact with? What are you going to be doing? What do you want to do? I think, like, bending up and picking up rocks is probably one of those things you want to do. And some of the environment. So, you know, I'm thinking about those things, but I wanted to stay with just spacesuits in general, right. So, like, thinking about, you know, how a spacesuit is designed to meet needs, right. So, you're talking about the needs of a planet. Let's back up to, like, the [Extravehicular Mobility Unit] EMU, right. This is the suit that's on the International Space Station. It's meant for microgravity. What purposes is the EMU, what is the EMU addressing? What is it, how is it designed to operate the most efficiently in a microgravity environment?  Natalie Mary: OK, so transitioning from a suit made for microgravity to reduced gravity, there's definitely some differences in mobility. So, in microgravity you're really transitioning and translating with your arms and hands. And your boots and legs are pretty much stable or floating, I guess, per se. But for the Moon and Mars, reduced gravity will need that capability in the lower torso, waist, legs, boots, to walk on the surface, kneel down and pick something up, and explore on uneven terrain. The EMU was designed for microgravity, so it doesn't have those bearings in the lower torso or hiking-style boots designed for walking. And then, the life support for microgravity and vacuum is also different. It's designed for vacuum, and in the EMU, it's a great system. It's called Metox, but it uses a heavy oven, an air lock, to kind of bake off that CO2 for CO2 removal. And the suit mass itself is designed, it's not that big of a deal for microgravity, but it becomes pretty important when you start talking about the mass worn by the crew member on Mars and on the Moon. The EMU is also, it wasn't designed to be repaired and remove and replace components on orbit. You have the ability with ISS to be able to bring back the entire suit and fix things on Earth. And with Mars and the Moon, that's, we're looking at being able to repair components or remove and replace components in situ.  Host: Oh, see, that's a big deal, right? Because you, that's kind of a -- it's a much different of a trip to go from low-Earth orbit back to Earth than it is from Mars. I'm thinking about the features of the suit itself, right, things that you need. I think you have a great description of just what it's providing. I think another interesting component here is atmospheric pressure, right. So, we're used to, I think, sea level is like 14.7 PSI, pounds per square inch, on the Earth and that is matched within the environment of the International Space Station. Now, I know that suits are a little bit different. They go lower. And I'm curious as to why?  Natalie Mary: Yeah, OK. So, if you were to have a suit at our sea level atmosphere, at 14.7 Delta pressure to vacuum, it would pretty much blow up like a balloon and it would be really stiff, so that you could barely move your joints let alone your fingers. So, during an EVA, the suit pressure is actually lowered to around 4.3 PSID. And to do that, you increase the oxygen content to 100% oxygen to both allow for improved mobility and to prevent decompression sickness or what we call the bends, you usually hear it called during scuba diving. And so, you can actually change the atmosphere in the vehicle, too, prior to an EVA, to reduce that duration of pre-breathe. But when you reduce the pressure, you have to increase your oxygen concentration. That also increases flammability risks. And so, there is actually some testing going on, it's pretty exciting, this year to help come up with those kind of exploration atmospheres to use across vehicles from like cislunar to the Moon to Mars and come up with some commonality in the ecosystems.  Host: Oh, that's pretty cool. Just like a guide for if you're working here, this is the atmospheric pressure you want. Maybe about composition, too. So, that's what you're doing, you're making almost a guidebook for, depending on where you're exploring.  Natalie Mary: Exactly, yeah. And that'll help with probably coming up with the objectives of a mission or the particular science objective and what you want to do during an EVA, how often you want to go EVA, and that duration. So, those different atmospheres will affect that time that you prepare for an EVA.  Host: Cool. So, we're talking about atmospheric pressures and, Natalie, you went through a lot of the components of, you know, what's on the suits that we know. These microgravity suits, right. The oxygen, waste management, power. Really what we're leading up to here is talking about the next generations of suits. We ultimately want to suit up for Mars, but I know we're working on a suit right now called the [Exploration Extravehicular Mobility Unit] xEMU. And we actually had a podcast about it with Chris Hansen, another episode. It's called, \"Artemis Spacesuits,\" that took a deep dive into the technical aspects of them. But let's take a refresher course, Natalie, on this xEMU. What are we going to be talking about for this particular suit? Some of those primary high-level things?  Natalie Mary: OK, yeah, these are really exciting times to be working with the EVA community, because we've already incorporated a lot of things and lessons learned from past spacesuits and 50 years of EVAs. And so, one of the major things, I think, are incorporating the increased upper mobility and lower mobility to allow those crew members to perform the science that they want and go exploring. And so, I had the pleasure of going on a geology field trip with our awesome geologists, and it was amazing. And while you plan a traverse prior to going into the field, you end up finding interesting rocks or transitional regions that just make you want to go climb into the rocks or dig and collect samples. For instance, the scientists want to be able to go into a permanently shadowed crater or region and collect samples or climb on some uneven terrain. And so, we've incorporated that mobility by including hip and leg bearings so that you can rotate and bend and get down and onto your knee and collect a sample. And so, the upper torso has also been made with greater mobility in mind, not only for the smaller crew members, but also being able to rotate the shoulders, and those side bearings have been moved closer in, so that you can reach over and touch, you know, your shoulder. And so, those are really interesting for lunar and Mars surfaces, that we can learn from even further.  Host: So, tell me about this geology expedition. What was your role in that? I don't know if you got to put on the suit, that would be awesome.  Natalie Mary: Oh, no. I wish. I have been in, I've got to be in the EMU, and that was really cool. But we went out shirt-sleeved, and we had like a beginning lesson, basically, on what we were going to do the next day. And planned out traverses to try and find out what exactly happened if there was a lava flow there, how the terrain had changed. And we learned some of the -- I guess, rocks that you can see how things were formed in that region. And so, it was really cool. We just, we went out and started off at the same point. And we had different teams. And we mapped out a region, and we ended up changing our traverses along the way as we chipped off really cool rocks with, oh, gosh. I can't remember all the geology terms now. I'm not a geologist. But it was very interesting, learning how to go along and what you wanted to climb, or get down and chip a rock off. And all of these things, thinking about being in a suit, a pressurized suit, is what we, how we need to really be able to make the suit work for these objectives.  Host: And so, that was going to be my question, right. It sounds like you were learning a little bit about geology, but you as a spacesuit expert, you were understanding, when you're on an expedition, here's the sort of movements you're going to need to make. And it sounds like there's a little bit of, you know, there's bending up, there was bending, there was, like, climbing over stuff. You just, it seems like mobility is just one of those things that's necessary for successful geological expedition.  Natalie Mary: Oh, for sure, yeah. It was eye-opening.  Host: Yeah. Now you said you also go to put on the suit. So, what was that like?  Natalie Mary: Oh, it was incredible. Well, the EMU, I got to put that on a couple years ago. And it was interesting because it's a waist-entry suit. And so, this was in 1g, of course, so I had two techs helping me get into the lower torso and kind of pull the pants, per se, up. And then they kind of help you hold that while you get underneath the upper torso of the EMU and reach up with your hands first and get in that way. And so, that's, and then, of course, they sealed it up and put the cooling on. And it was super cool. I loved it. So, that's another feature of the xEMU is, instead of the crew member pulling up the pants and ingressing the suit through the upper torso, we call it a rear-entry suit. And that's how the crew member ingresses, is through the back hatch of the suit. And that makes it easier for the crew member to be able to climb in and out of the suit, and also decreases crew injury with the shoulders.  Host: So, there's a couple of things that we're thinking about, right. Because ultimately the suit that you're talking about, the xEMU, what we're considering is the stuff that you're going to do while you're exploring the surface of the Moon or Mars. So, the discussions we're having now is, like, mobility, right. So, you got that lower mobility, you got the upper mobility. It sounds like there's this rear-entry suit and there's got to be a reason for that, right. What do you, because one of the things you said early in the podcast was, the things you are considering is what are we going to be doing on the surface? And that's going to inform design. So, obviously, you know, having more ability, mobility rather, on the lower torso to bend over and on the upper torso to grab rocks and climb stuff. The suit port has to serve a purpose for what you're going to be doing on the surface, right. So, how does that come into play? Why is that necessary for, when you're operating on the Moon?  Natalie Mary: OK, yeah, so suit ports are a technology that you may have seen on the pressurized rover pics or even here on site at JSC in Building 9 [Space Vehicle Mockup Facility]. But we're considering it within the range of technology options being evaluated for our suit technology, which is flexible enough to support it, given those things that I just mentioned. And so, being able to don the suit through the back hatch, the suit has that capability, as well as the capability of a variable pressure regulator so that you can start at a different or higher-pressure differential. This could allow the crew member, depending on what starting pressure they're saturated at, to be able to have a shorter pre-breathe, ingress the suit through that hatch, and hop off the vehicle, basically. So, it could decrease that pre-EVA time quite a bit. And so, there's a lot of discussion on if you want to jump out and look at something interesting, or if you want to stay out for longer. Basically, you could have that capability of doing both. You would be able to plan your traverses and have the capability to perform a longer EVA. If you're out for a long time, and you want to perform science at a specific site. Or have that cycle capability if you want to perform multiple EVAs in a day.  Host: So, let's continue down that path, Natalie, about exploring the operations of performing an EVA on the surface. Take us through what that's going to be like. You already mentioned, you know, entering through the back port of the suit, and doing a pre-breathe operations, but what's an excursion going to look like? Let's start with the Moon. What would an excursion look like on the Moon?  Natalie Mary: Yeah, so, we have some operational concepts that we're looking at. If you have a habitat, say, and a pressurized rover, you're looking at going out on excursions in the pressurized rover, away from the habitat for maybe a week or two at a time, and kind of doing maybe a cloverleaf-type traverse. Kind of going out farther and then coming back into the locations that scientists want to go perform their objectives. And so, maybe during a day you'd go out in your pressurized rover, and then your pre-breathe, you're already saturated at that pressure. And so, you're able to get in your suit, perform suit checkout, egress the suit port and perform your science objective. Possibly come back in for lunch or potty break, or something like that. And then go back out. Or you could go out for even longer – eight -hour duration EVA -- and come back in. And eventually, we're going to need to perform suit maintenance on the suits. And so, to do that, we're going to be using a pressurizable volume and bringing the suits inside a pressurizable volume like an airlock on the habitat. So, eventually you'd go back to that habitat and bring the suits inside an airlock for suit maintenance.  Host: Oh, interesting, OK. So, yeah, you would have that ability. So, I guess the suit can, yeah, would have to be in that airlock so you can regularly work on it. The maintenance that you're doing would be like, you know, switching out internal components, maybe? Are we talking, maybe, gloves? What do you mean by maintenance?  Natalie Mary: Yeah, so we do have experience. With ISS, you've got an engineered, smooth surface except for a micrometeorite. So, we do have some debris that will hit handrails and things like that. So, there are sharp edges on the ISS, so we have experience with that. But what we don't have as much experience with is, you know, the sharp, dusty environment of the Moon. Or the dusty environment of Mars. And so, we know just from ISS that we need to change out gloves fairly frequently. So, that's something that, an example of some suit maintenance that we would need to do on the surface. And then, there's other components that we, maybe, are called limited-life items, things that we know we'll need to replace after a certain amount of cycle life. And so, that's when we would bring the suit inside for suit maintenance. But that is, actually, another way we're going to be using the Moon as an analog to Mars, is understanding further those operations of the pressurized rover, suit maintainability, and suit reliability. So, those things we might be able to decrease in time, the more we know about the suit. And what the main components and sparing philosophy will be for the Moon and Mars.  Host: Oh, interesting, yeah. That makes a lot of sense, right, Moon, that's part of the Artemis program, returning to the surface of the Moon and performing those operations. A lot of the stuff that you're doing there, the operations that you're talking about, having, you know, the design of how you're going to be performing an EVA and how you maintain the suits and everything. That's really good, really good analog. Really good practice for when you ultimately end up at the surface of Mars.  Natalie Mary: Exactly, yeah. It's just another steppingstone and what we call or refer to as an analog for Mars. And while there are differences and challenges between the Moon and Mars that we will need further technology development with, there's a lot of similarities there that we'll learn from on the Moon.  Host: Well, let's go into understanding a little bit about what Mars is going to throw at us when we actually get there on the surface and start working in spacesuits. So, what is it about Mars, you know, what is it about the Mars environment that you are preparing for and that you are putting into the design of a spacesuit?  Natalie Mary: Yeah, OK. So, Mars does have, you know, an atmosphere albeit a small one. But there's actually wind and fine particles that will get on the suit. It's also dusty like the Moon. Hopefully less sharp dust because of the atmosphere. But the lunar surface will get us a lot closer to understanding kind of like a layered engineering protocol to design the suits for removal of dust outside of the habitable volume and removal and cleaning of dust inside the habitat. And this will become really important on Mars, too, because of planetary protection. So, there's a committee on space research that classifies the Moon and Mars differently. And we'll likely have to abide by more stringent planetary protection protocols on Mars than we do on ISS and the Moon. And so, that means protecting Mars science from human contaminants, or forward contamination. And protecting the human from anything that might be harmful on Mars, or backward contamination. So, the suit ports could also be an important process of preventing that backward contamination by what is referred to as breaking the chain or leaving the dusty suits behind on the surfaces of Mars. And with that, though, with the suit port design, it also does have impacts on or changes that would need to be made from an initial xEMU to a Mars suit. And so, it can add mass to the suit, because it has to add a suit port interface plate that actually is a sealing surface between the suit and the bulkhead of the pressurized rover. So, one of the things we're really going to be looking forward to is the technology development of that. But the technology development of how we can reduce the mass on the suit for Mars. So, that gets really important when you're talking about getting down to Mars surface after being in microgravity for so long, getting to that 3/8 gravity as opposed to what we've learned from the Moon's 1/6 gravity. And so, with the crew members having been in space for six to nine months, they've really gotten acclimated to microgravity. So, when you get to the surface, you really don't want to battle a heavy suit with a very different, or possibly different, CG [center of gravity] after being in microgravity. And then getting down to the surface. And so, I know doctors are saying that they will need to acclimate to that higher gravity over a certain amount of time, and so we'll stay in the vehicle for a little bit longer, possibly, before performing an EVA. But that mass reduction and understanding CG will be a big deal for crew members acclimating to the Martian gravity.  Host: So, now we're talking about taking this, what we're thing about for the xEMU, right, this is the one we're thinking about for the surface of Mars. So, you're talking about taking a step further. What technologies are needed to take that step to eventually work on the surface of Mars? Mass reduction is one of those things. What else? What else are we thinking about that, some technology we need to develop for getting ready for working on Mars?  Natalie Mary: OK, yeah. We definitely know we have some upgrades that we need to do to develop a suit for Mars. And so, materials is one of those things as well. We're looking, we're actually going to have some materials on landing on Mars pretty soon, on the Perseverance rover. I think that's --  Host: Oh, cool.  Natalie Mary: -- Yeah, yeah. I think that's February 18th, right. So, it'll be carrying a payload called SHERLOC [Scanning Habitable Environments with Raman & Luminescence for Organics & Chemicals], which includes materials from the visor and pressure garment system to see how well they hold up to the radiation on Mars over time. And some other technologies are, like we mentioned, the atmosphere on Mars is more of a CO2 atmosphere. And then, the thermal environment is different. So, those are two, sometimes what we call gaps that we're looking forward in our strategic planning on technologies that we can upgrade for Mars. So, our xEMU technology is awesome and it's really more efficient for vacuum, though. It uses a swingbed technology. And so, that CO2 is collected on one side of the bed, and then once it's flipped it is vented to vacuum. But with a CO2 atmosphere on Mars, an upgrade will be necessary. And so, the same thing goes with the cooling swingbeds, and the fact that Mars has more of a convective thermal atmosphere with weather and seasons than a radiator like the vacuum of space and lunar surface. So, we'll be looking at different technologies for CO2 removal and thermal cooling and heating. And another change is going to be that comm delay between Earth and Mars, right. It could be, I think we were talking, up to 22 minutes one way. And so, we rely a lot on the MCC - Mission Control Center to provide guidance and monitor data and send commands right now for ISS, and also for Mars -- I mean for Moon. But for Mars, crew autonomy's going to become a lot more important. More important than ever, with crew members possibly consisting of scientists and then greater reliance on software and procedures on the suit. And maybe intravehicular crew member guidance. Like your crew members that are on Mars with you. And so, that communication is going to become really important, and autonomy.  Host: See, that wouldn't even be something that I would think of immediately, you know. And I actually do commentary for spacewalks now, and you can just hear over the loops, just all the behind-the-scenes work, all the behind-the-scenes chatter that's happening as we're watching a spacewalk happen real time. There's decisions being made and people analyzing data from all these different angles. So, it's just, it's really, just understanding that from my perspective and being a part of that, thinking about all of that goes away, right, all of those helping hands, all those eyeballs go away. Because there's no way to efficiently conduct a spacewalk with you're waiting 22 minutes, even more, more than that, for an answer, if you have a question. Very interesting stuff. Is there thoughts to practice this, you know? Whether it's on the Moon or otherwise, just to sort of get used to it before we do it for real?  Natalie Mary: Yeah, we actually do a lot of analog work in 1g on this. And even incorporating in delays in comms. And then, I think that's a great analog for the Moon is, once we start upgrading our informatic systems and even allowing the crew members during an EVA to change procedures or make decisions based on the science that they see right in front of their face, then that's a really good analog to use the Moon as well.  Host: Well, Natalie, I'm super excited about Mars. And it just sounds like there's a lot of challenges ahead to take that next step, and close those gaps, as you were saying, right. There's just a lot of work ahead. But I'm thinking about the near future. I'm thinking about Artemis and how near-term that seems to us right now, you know. Going on the surface of the Moon and working and doing great science and everything. I'm curious from your perspective working on spacesuits, I'm curious to hear what you are excited for this upcoming period of time where we're going to have a new generation of moonwalkers, and what you're looking forward to doing and exploring that's going to help you in your job in understand how to live and work on Mars in spacesuits.  Natalie Mary: Oh, yeah, I'm super excited. This is an awesome time to be working in the EVA community and lunar surface and Artemis. And so, yeah, Artemis just offers great opportunity to test out our systems and operations closer to home and understand that maintenance and reliability and the operations and crew autonomy. And so, even though some of those aspects of our Mars suit are different than the Artemis lunar suit, there's just so many of the operations like dust removal is a big thing, and in situ suit maintenance. And so, I think those are going to be an amazing analog to go from Mars.  Host: Very cool. Natalie, this has been really, really, really interesting to dive so deep into, you know, not even this next generation of suits, but it's cool to hear that there's a team of really smart people thinking about the generation after that, right. Just getting us ready to take those next steps. So, it was really a pleasure to talk to you about and dive deep into all the fascinating aspects of the Martian spacesuit. I appreciate your time, Natalie.  Natalie Mary: Thank you.  [ Music]  Host: Hey, thanks for sticking around. I hope you learned something today from Natalie Mary, diving deep into what's needed for designing that next generation of suits, those Martian spacesuits, and even some of the stuff that's coming up for lunar exploration. It was a pleasure to have her on. This was just one of many podcasts that we've been diving into as part of our “Mars Monthly” series. We've been releasing at least one episode about Mars every month for, oh gosh, almost a year now. You can check them all out. We actually have put them together in a collection on our website. That's at, just search Houston We Have A Podcast/Mars episodes. It'll come up. This, I think, is episode nine, maybe 10. But we only have one more. We're going to throw in a bonus episode as well, but I hope you are able to tune into all of them. And if not, before we get to that last episode coming up in March, that'll be the last time that we drop a “Mars Monthly” episode, go ahead to that website and you can go ahead and catch up on all the conversations we've had so far about a human mission to Mars. Natalie mentioned upfront more about learning about spacesuits in general. There's a website for that, NASA.gov/suitup. You can take a deep dive into all the work being done there.

                        "description": "Gary Jordan (Host): Houston, we have a podcast. Welcome to the official podcast of the NASA Johnson Space Center, Episode 182, \"Mars Perseverance Landing.\" I'm Gary Jordan, and I'll be your host today. On this podcast, we bring in the experts, scientists, engineers, astronauts, all to let you know what's going on in the world of human spaceflight, space exploration, and today, landing a rover on Mars. On July 30th, 2020, NASA's Mars Perseverance rover launched atop a ULA Atlas V-541 rocket from Cape Canaveral Air Force station in Florida. Since then, it's been traveling at more than 50,000 miles per hour cruising towards Mars to make the near 300-million-mile trek through deep space for seven months and land on Jezero Crater on the Red Planet. That journey is nearing its end. On February 18th, 2021, Perseverance will make its way through the Martian atmosphere and enter into what is famously known as the seven minutes of terror. This is the phase of flight called entry, descent, and landing. And for Perseverance and the teams at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, this may be the most critical seven minutes of the flight to the Martian surface. So, here to go into the details on entry, descent, and landing of Perseverance is Chloe Sackier, Entry, Descent, and Landing Communications Systems Engineer at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory. So, let's get right into it. Enjoy.  [ Music]  Host: Chloe Sackier, thanks for coming on Houston We Have a Podcast.  Chloe Sackier: Thank you so much for having me.  Host: Hey, we're in the home stretch here. We're coming up on something I think you have been preparing for a very long time. How are you feeling in this moment right now, just being so close to the Perseverance landing?  Chloe Sackier: Very, very excited. A little nervous. I think the nerves, everyone is feeling as we get closer and closer. Right now, at the time of this recording, we are 30 some days away from February 18th, our big day.  Host: That's right. And there's a lot to do just beforehand and then what we're going to dive into today is exactly what this -- what this moment is that we're talking about. The landing. And what's going to go down. I want to give our listeners though a bit of background and kind of just start from the beginning to talk about what this thing is that is landing on Mars and why it's such a big deal. Let's just start there, Chloe, what is the Perseverance lander?  Chloe Sackier: Sure. So, the Perseverance rover is the most capable rover that NASA and JPL have ever built. And are sending to Mars. It's tasked with some really exciting mission objectives. It's searching for signs of ancient life, collecting rock and regolith samples for possible future sample returns. And it's preparing for humans eventually traveling to Mars. The part that I'm most knowledgeable about is that it's landing on Jezero Crater on the Red Planet on the 18th of February 2021. Jezero Crater is the site of an ancient river delta in a lake that used to fill this crater. And additionally, on top of all that exciting science, Perseverance also carries a smaller robotic buddy. A little helicopter named Ingenuity, which will be the very first aircraft to test controlled flight on another planet. So, lots of exciting firsts.  Host: Yeah, absolutely. Now this landing on Jezero Crater, this is -- you said it's a river delta, and that's -- it sounds very interesting. It sounds like that there's a reason that we're going to land in this area. What's so special about Jezero?  Chloe Sackier: Yeah. So, Jezero Crater was identified as a really exciting site that had a lot of scientific potential. Because it is this ancient river delta location. There are all these fascinating and super rich mineral deposits that scientists think might be able to help us answer those questions about seeking signs of ancient life. And also, from an entry, descent, and landing perspective, it's a safe enough site for us to touch the Perseverance rover down at a nice, safe, clean location.  Host: Yeah, right? You don't want a lot of stuff in the way of that landing. And that journey, it sounds like a long ways, right? I think it's like 300 million miles that the journey was from Earth to Mars. And it launched last year, July 30th I believe was the launch date. We kind of pushed it back but we were still within that window. Were you there? Were you there at the launch? Were you able to witness it?  Chloe Sackier: I was, yes. I was fortunate enough to travel to the launch at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida. Of course, due to the pandemic, the launch wasn't quite the celebratory affair that we were all sort of expecting.  Host: Right, yeah.  Chloe Sackier: Several of us were able to travel safely along so we could watch in a socially distant beach setting, the launch, and listen along and support our friends and colleagues on console as they ensured a successful and safe launch.  Host: So, there's a lot that goes into that, right? There was a lot of prep work to get Perseverance into that rocket, you know, there was, you've already mentioned a few of the objectives of Perseverance. So, there's quite a number of instruments on there. But your role, Chloe, is entry, descent, and landing. So, what have you been up to throughout the whole development of this, the Perseverance rover, what goes into preparing for entry, descent, and landing on Mars?  Chloe Sackier: So, entry, descent, and landing, I think is such a fascinating phase of the mission. Because it's really just a handful of minutes. But it takes years and years and hundreds of thousands of man hours of effort to ensure that those few minutes go safely and smoothly. My personal role on the entry, descent, and landing team is ensuring that our spacecraft is talking to us. I'm the entry, descent, and landing communication systems engineer. So, I care about making sure that the rich set of data that we generate during entry, descent, and landing, or EDL, makes it off of our spacecraft, makes it to our orbiters at Mars. Makes it through the deep space network. And then eventually back to us at JPL so we can reconstruct exactly what is happening during those exciting minutes. We're really invested and interested in knowing exactly what goes on during those minutes. So, we want to wrangle all of the ears that we can on the Earth side and all the ears we can on Mars and have them pointed towards Mars and listening into what the spacecraft is saying to us.  Host: So, what's it saying, Chloe? What do you care about? When you're getting this data, what is meaningful data that's going to help you to be successful for the EDL phase?  Chloe Sackier: Yeah. So, we're really invested in what she's saying in part because we want to know that she's OK, because those seven minutes of terror, as it's often referred to, are really quite scary. And it's easily the most dangerous part of the mission. So, we're invested in just hearing from Perseverance as often as we can during entry, descent, and landing. But we also want to understand what decisions she's making as she's progressing throughout that flight, throughout EDL. So, we care about -- she sends us little bit of telemetry that explain what decision she makes autonomously, and then of course, once she touches down safely, the rover lets us know that it's alright and that EDL went well.  Host: Very cool. So, what has Perseverance been up to so far? We talked about launch last year. Since launch, you know, it was inserted into an orbit -- around the Earth. And then eventually did a trans Mars injection burn to get all the way to that planet. What's happened since then? What has it been doing?  Chloe Sackier: Yeah, so, as you mentioned earlier, it's a nearly 300-million-mile journey to Mars. And at this point, we've traveled nearly 250 million miles. But that seven-month journey is anything but quiet. Engineers at JPL like to keep a close eye on the spacecraft while she's cruising. We do all sorts of things to make sure that she is doing OK and that we're prepared for eventually entry, descent, and landing, and then the following surface operations. So, we keep an eye on the health, we carry out general maintenance, and monitoring, calibrate a lot of subsystems and instruments. We perform some small attitude corrections to make sure that we keep antennas pointed back towards Earth so we can talk to the spacecraft. And then we want to keep our solar panels pointed towards the Sun, so we get power. And then on top of all that, we also do these Trajectory Correction Maneuvers to tweak the flight path and make sure we're headed to the right target. And then of course, we do a lot of instrument check-outs for devices that we specifically care about during EDL. Make sure that everything's ready to turn on.  Host: Now I was looking at some of those course correction maneuvers, and there weren't many on the way to Mars. But from what I saw, they really picked up in the February time frame, like right before landing. So why do you need to make -- at least these more major corrections, or significant milestones, why are they later in the flight?  Chloe Sackier: Yeah, so we have five opportunities plus one back-up and one contingency maneuver to adjust our flight path. And then when those maneuvers occurred, they all sort of have different -- we get something different out of each one. So, the Trajectory Correction Maneuvers that we do earlier on, like a couple of weeks after launch, those help us point the spacecraft towards the general direction of Mars and fine tune the flight path after launch. And sort of help us get rid of any injection errors that might have come from our launch. And then the TCM, the Trajectory Correction Maneuvers in the middle of cruise, like the December-ish timeframe, really helped us fine tune that even more, even more precisely. Then the maneuvers that we do in February, leading up to entry, descent, and landing, are really more targeted. And then also a backup and contingency maneuver that we don't plan to use but are available to us if we need to at the last minute.  Host: It's really about making sure that, that trajectory is right on target. Because you got a tiny little area that you want to hit, right? And that's Jezero Crater. And you have 300 million miles to make the arrow fly exactly where you want to, I guess is the way to think about it.  Chloe Sackier: Yeah. That's absolutely right. And we like to joke around a lot that the spacecraft flies itself, the EDL flies itself, but we have to -- our job leading up to EDL is to make sure that she has all the information about her -- the way that she's coming into the planet. Because that really helps ensure that EDL comes off more successfully.  Host: So, this is not going to be just like a new thing for you guys. I'm sure that the Jet Propulsion Laboratory has put together simulations and programs and run through and tested what you guys believe is going to be the EDL environmental. What's going to happen during those phases of flight. How do you construct those sims, how did they go? Just more about, I guess, practicing for the ultimate entry, descent, and landing phase of this flight.  Chloe Sackier: Yeah. So, we have definitely spent a long time preparing. And as the saying goes, “practice makes perfect.” And we have many different ways that we essential dry run or practice EDL to make sure that we understand everything about the system, and we're prepared for anything that Mars might throw at us. So, like many other people on the EDL team, I'm also a member of the EDL testing team in our mission system test bed, which is essentially, I like to compare it to a car. Because it's this amazingly -- the test bed is an amazingly complex vehicle in its own right. It's basically all the guts and brains of the real-life spacecraft laid out on a table. And you can send commands to it and send it through these different simulated environments. So, in this test bed, we basically get to dry run EDL over and over and over. And ensure that the flight software's interfacing correctly with the hardware, I like to say that we're essentially rehearsing the choreography of EDL and oftentimes in off-nominal situations. To make sure that the flight system is really robust. So, sometimes we might do a simulation with an atmosphere that is different from what our models tell us to expect. Or we'll do a simulation with some important devices not functioning the way we would expect them to. And then we study the response of the flight system to those fault injections.  Host: So, all of this was just making sure that before you sent Perseverance into space for that ultimate landing, that you had the confidence necessary, because you've gone through all of these different simulated environments to make sure that Perseverance, she can stand up to the test. And that's really the goal there was that's why you were doing all of this repetitious, you mentioned over and over and over, all these repetitious sims.  Chloe Sackier: Yeah. And I think the interesting thing that people may not always appreciate about this phase is that there's no way really for us to test this system in an end to end manner on the ground. Because we can't -- on the ground meaning on Earth, here, on this planet. We can't simulate Mars in the exact same way that we're going to be sending the spacecraft through. So, we sort of have to address -- we have to test the whole system in bits and pieces. So, we can test our flight software and flight hardware. We can go through these specific bits of hardware in the system. Like parachute tests. Or like tests specific to the rover. But we can't test it all together in an environment just like what we'll see in February on Mars until we're actually doing the real thing.  Host: Now, this February landing, February 18th. From what I understand, this, you know, I talked about in the beginning, you know, ultimately the launch was July 30th but there was this window. And I guess because of the way orbital mechanics works, February 18th is your day, right? There's no -- circle around and retry, like this is your moment, right?  Chloe Sackier: Yep. There's no go around.  Host: So, it's got to work, right? That's why you do all the -- another reason you do all of the tests is because you really only have one shot. There's no redo, there's no start over, this is it -- is one moment, one shot.  Chloe Sackier: Yes. Yes. That's absolutely right. And like I mentioned earlier, this thing does land itself, but we need to help it. So, we care about, in our final approach phase prior to EDL, we want to get the spacecraft ready for EDL, so we monitor all of these activities that the spacecraft is doing, these reconfigurations and mode transitions and conditioning and turning everything on. We want to make sure we get to the right place to start EDL at the right time so that we're really on target and we make sure that our entry guidance that's run inside the spacecraft's computers, we're not stressing it too much and it's able to do the job that we're asking it. And then we also want to tell the spacecraft what it needs to know. So, when I mentioned all those Trajectory Correction Maneuvers, and these parameter updates that we're doing in these last few weeks, that's what we're doing and really preparing the spacecraft to hit that exact point, that exact location at that exact point in time.  Host: So, I want to get a picture of just what's flying through space right now. Because we all saw the launch, but it was this rocket, you know, and there was a shell on top of it. So, we couldn't see kind of the construction of what this things looks like flying through space. Give us a picture of what it looks like in the cruise phase right now.  Chloe Sackier: Sure. So, there's the Perseverance and tiny little Ingenuity hanging on underneath. The rover is wrapped up in the heat shield in the descent stage in the back shell. And that, all of those critical pieces right there are essentially the main players in EDL. So, the heat shield will protect us during entry. The back shell is what we deploy our parachute from. And that's sort of behind the rover. And then the descent stages is what flies us to our actual -- it's sort of like our rover jetpack. So, all of that is packaged up and held by the cruise stage, which is the vehicle that takes us all the way to Mars. It has all of the fuel tanks and the radio equipment and antennas and everything. And that cruise stage takes us all the way until just ten minutes before entry. And then at that point, we separate from the cruise stage.  Host: You guys have got a cool website where you can kind of see, it's like a map of where this is. This whole setup that you're talking about, where it is in space and how fast it's going. And last time I looked, it was traveling at 50,000 miles per hour. Is that how fast it's going to get 300 million miles away?  Chloe Sackier: Yes, yes, 50,000 miles per hour. Quite a speeding ticket.  Host: Yeah. [Laughter]  Chloe Sackier: Well it's got a long ways to go, so we have no time to waste. [Laughter]  Host: Well, Chloe, let's go into the entry, descent, and landing phase. This is the seven minutes of terror as you called it. What -- I'm curious to hear why it is called that. But let's go through step by step this, you know, what's going to happen as it gets closer to Mars and gets into this phase?  Chloe Sackier: Sure. So, as I mentioned just before we separate from our cruise stage, that vehicle that safely escorted us all the way to Mars, about ten minutes before entry, and then at entry, we hit the atmosphere of Mars. We use the atmosphere of Mars to start slowing down. It's thinner than the atmosphere of Earth. So, we can't slow down completely using it. But there's enough atmosphere there that it does help us bleed off a little bit of velocity. And during that time, we're protected by that heat shield. About 80 seconds after entry, we hit a period called peak heating. At that point, the temperature on the outside of the heat shield is around 2,300 degrees Fahrenheit, or 1,300 degrees Celsius. Really, really hot. And during that time, while we're doing entry, we're steering towards our target using this principle called guided entry, that was essentially adapted from the Apollo era. And this approach helps us stay on target while we might be hitting pockets of air that would maybe bump us around a little bit. While we're on that heat shield, we slow down to just under 1,000 miles per hour. And then at that point, we deploy the largest supersonic planetary parachute that has ever been used. It's about 70 and a half feet or 21 and a half meters in diameter. And we deploy it at about mock 1.75. Also, really, really fast. At that point, we're about seven miles high in altitude and going 940 miles per hour. And then shortly after that, we jettison our heat shield at about mock 0.7. This uncovers the radar that we use to start searching for the ground. And this is where the Terrain Relative Navigation concept takes the stage. And starts searching for the ground. We use this concept, TRN, to take pictures of where we are and match those pictures up to an onboard map. So it's sort of like an -- like if you're driving in your car and you use a GPS instead of just looking out the window, you see pictures of where you are and you match those up to your map to help you figure out and localize yourself. So then around this point, we drop out, our descent stage, that rover jetpack, drops out of the back shell. Because we don't want to recontact that back shell and parachute. We execute a divert maneuver to quickly get out of the way. At this point, we're just under 7000 feet above the surface. And then while we're at that descent stage, that takes us down to a velocity of I think .75 meters per second. So, way, way slower than we've been traveling before. And when we're traveling this fast, we're about 20 meters off the ground. And then at this point, we execute the sky crane maneuver. So, this is what was originally debuted on the Curiosity rover. Separates the rover from the descent stage, from that rocket jetpack, and touches Perseverance down safely and slowly on her wheels. And then as soon as we have confirmation of -- as soon as the rover has confirmed that she's touched down, we separate the descent stage connection and fly the descent stage away to a safe distance. And that's all there is to it. We're on Mars.  Host: All there is to it. But when you think about it, all of that, everything you just described happens in seven minutes. And the challenge there is, I think, one of the challenges at least, there's a lot of challenges, you just went over a lot of them. But one of them is, like you said, this is all happening by itself. Because Mars is so far away that by the time it actually communicates what's happening to you on Earth, at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, real time on Mars, it has already happened because of the communication delay, right?  Chloe Sackier: Yes, that's true. Our one-way light time at this point in the mission is over 11 minutes. So, it takes 11 minutes for information to travel from Mars back to us at Earth. And because of that massive distance and massive delay, we can't joystick the rover through landing. We can't fly it ourselves. It has to happen completely autonomously.  Host: That's incredible. Chloe, I want to go through and kind of ask questions about every phase of this flight from beginning to end. We did actually have a subtle dropout. You were talking about, you talked about slowing down and entering into the atmosphere. We kind of missed that part of it. But I think the question about that phase was how do we get down from 50,000 miles an hour to the 10,000 miles an hour? Is that what you said? Was it 10,000 miles an hour when you actually hit the atmosphere?  Chloe Sackier: Yeah. So, it's a little complicated, orbital mechanics wise. But basically, in cruise, we are traveling 50,000 miles per hour relative to the Sun. But then once we actually hit the atmosphere for entry, at that point, we're going about 12,000 miles per hour, a little over 12,000 miles per hour.  Host: OK. So, it's not really slowing down, it's just kind of relative to how fast Mars is traveling or something like that?  Chloe Sackier: Yeah, that's true. The 50,000 is relative to the position of the Sun and then when we hit atmosphere, that 12,000 number, that's relative to Mars.  Host: Got it.  Chloe Sackier: But we do use the atmosphere to slow down significantly before we deploy our heat shield. We bleed off a lot of velocity.  Host: Right, it goes from 10,000 to 1,000 miles an hour, right?  Chloe Sackier: We deploy our parachute -- yeah. Just about around 1,000 miles an hour. A little under.  Host: Now -- I got it. You were talking about some, you know, some of the sims you were running. And these parachutes, you're deploying them at supersonic speeds, right? I mean I feel like if you were to deploy anything at that speed it would just kind of snap. So how does that work, you know? How does a supersonic -- how are you able to deploy a supersonic parachute that's able to, you know, perform that job and not snap?  Chloe Sackier: Carefully. Yeah, no, that's true. It's a blistering high speed. And to have a soft goods material that's capable of withstanding that, we basically built a really, really strong parachute. And test it in all of these different stressing conditions. So, we -- when I mentioned earlier about testing EDL in bits and pieces, the parachute is obviously this critical component, this sort of quarterback of the team that our safe EDL is dependent and reliant on. So, we test our parachute in big wind tunnels. We do sounding rocket tests to simulate what that supersonic deployment might look like and feel like to the parachute. And then all sorts of lower level tests as well.  Host: So, what's challenging, you talked about the heat shield heating up to I think it was 1300 degrees. You have supersonic parachutes that are deploying here. What are the challenges here with just Mars being the planet that it is? It's got an atmosphere, so you have to deal with that atmosphere, so you have to have a heat shield. But you don't have enough, you know, a thick enough atmosphere where parachutes aren't going to do the whole, you know, as much as they do on Earth, for any missions that we have. We deploy parachutes and they land safely, either on land and water. What are some of the challenges here with just dealing with Mars?  Chloe Sackier: Yeah, so as you mentioned, there's the common expression is that there's not fear to really use it enough to ever break to the point where we've, you know, have slowed down enough. But there's just enough atmosphere that you have to pay attention to it and take it into consideration. There's all of these, you know, it's always fascinating to learn about Mars' weather and to even think about what weather looks like on another planet. But Mars is a planet, just like our own. It has weather, it has winds, it has dust storms, all of these components that we have to study and understand a little bit about so we can plan how they might impact us and affect us. There's the parachute, we already discussed the excitement of the parachute. When we get to the stage where we have jettisoned our heat shield and we're using our radar to search for the ground, that's a really fascinating point in the mission as well because we -- we're looking to land in Jezero Crater, which is this scientifically exciting location. But also, from an entry, descent, and landing perspective, we need a landing site that is safe enough to touch down. So, the things that we're looking for is an altitude of the landing site that's not too high, it gives us enough time to stop. And not too dangerous to land on. So, not completely full of sand dunes or rocks or slopes or really rough terrain. We want it to be radar reflective to a certain extent. And that the atmospheric conditions, like I mentioned, are OK. Not too dusty, not too windy. So, Jezero Crater's really this interesting spot. Because it's, from a terrain perspective, most exciting that we've ever attempted a landing on for EDL. But we want to get there for the science. And our new -- new technological functionality of TRN allows us to travel to that little bit more rocky, little bit more sandy crater that we care about visiting.  Host: Well let's go into that. Let's go into Terrain Relative Navigation. This is a critical technology that was put on Perseverance. What is this technology?  Chloe Sackier: Yes. So, Terrain Relative Navigation, quite simply put, it gives us eyes. So instead of just taking pictures, on the way down, we're taking those pictures and matching them up to a map that is onboard the spacecraft, like I mentioned earlier, just like you or I could look out the window while we're driving our car, and match up landmarks or things that we're seeing to a map. So TRN helps Perseverance figure out where it is and once the spacecraft knows where it is, it can use its engines to fly to a safe landing spot that it picks and decides upon. So, we, the humans behind the scenes, have done the work over the last few years to map out and really understand every little nook and cranny of this landing site. And identify, using some fascinating algorithms and sometimes just our eyes, the spots that we think are safe to land in and the spots that we don't want Perseverance to choose. And then we give all of that information to the spacecraft in the form of that onboard map, and then while she's flying EDL, she takes those pictures, checks those pictures, and where she thinks she is against at onboard map and says, “OK, this is where I want to fly, this is safe, I'm going to turn on my engines and lean over and fly that way.”  Host: So those engines, are they, are they in the back shell and they're just kind of little pulses to guide it the right way?  Chloe Sackier: We have a bunch of different engines in different places. There are -- there's the thrusters that we use to sort of reorient ourselves as we're coming in for entry. But the descent stage is what flies us to the safe landing spot that we pick.  Host: Now what's interesting, this is what I read, that Terrain Relative Navigation jumps up the chance of successful landing exactly where you want it from 80% or 85% to about 99%. So, that's how good this technology is at guiding down based on all the sims that you've done and used it with?  Chloe Sackier: Yeah. It's really incredible. As I mentioned earlier, what we're looking for in a safe landing site for EDL, slopes, craters, rocks, none of those things we really like. Those all really equate to landing death for EDL. But they're so interesting. They're massive science targets for the scientists. And at the end of the day, that's why we're doing this mission. We want to enable some really, really exciting science. And so, Curiosity and all the previous Mars missions had to ensure that anywhere that we could possibly touchdown was basically a parking lot. No sand dunes, nothing like that. But we don't have to do that with Perseverance, mostly in part due to Terrain Relative Navigation. There can be and will be rocks and slopes and craters in Jezero, Jezero Crater. Actually, the middle of the landing eclipse is a cliff base that's like 60 to 80 meters tall right on the edge of the river delta. So, it's -- I feel like if you were standing in the middle of Jezero Crater and looking around, it would be quite, quite beautiful but it’s exciting and a little more risky than has previously been attempted. But all of that is enabled because of the TRN technology.  Host: So, Chloe, I believe like me, and I'm sure thousands if not millions of others, are going to be glued to the TV trying to watch everything go down. What are we going to see? Are we going to get -- are we going to be able to see some of the things that Perseverance is seeing? Like the Terrain Relative Navigation providing a video feed. Are we going to be looking at the control room? What are we going to see?  Chloe Sackier: So, yes, so me and my whole team will be at JPL monitoring telemetry and anxiously awaiting with the rest of the world hearing confirmation that Perseverance has touched down safely. And we'll be doing our best to share everything that she's telling us with the world in real time as that's happening. We have multiple different ways of relaying the rich dataset that the spacecraft generates during EDL back to us on Earth during that timeframe. We have tones of the X band that are sent directly to Earth. I like to say it's sort of like the spacecraft singing us a little song as she flies EDL. So, these tones, each tone indicates a different critical event has happened. So, we might get a tone for the deployment of the parachute. Or a tone indicating that we just completed a bank reversal. These tones just sort of provide markers of events that the spacecraft has checked off. We also get a tone, a pretty persistent tone all the way throughout EDL that we call the heartbeat tone. And that's basically just the spacecraft giving us a thumbs up from Mars and saying like “yep, I'm still alive, I'm still trucking.” So, we love to see that intermittently and make sure that everything is OK. We also receive -- the spacecraft communicates UHF data to our orbiters, to the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiters, and the [Mars Atmosphere and Volatile Evolution Mission] MAVEN spacecraft during EDL. And those orbiters are at Mars. And those orbiters relay that information to the deep space network, which has stations in California and Spain and Australia. So, all over the world. And those stations relay that data back to us at JPL. And the dataset we get from the orbiters is a little bit richer than what the tones indicate. So, it tells us a bit more information about the decisions that the spacecraft is making and the environment that it's experiencing throughout EDL.  Host: And so, you will be in that control room during the EDL phase. And you've mentioned it before but make sure -- correct me if I'm summarizing this incorrectly, is your job is to make sure all of these connections, this pathway of how Perseverance is communicating to you guys in that control room, that those pathways are all functioning normally and properly and you're getting all the data you need?  Chloe Sackier: Yes. That's exactly correct. I think the most fascinating thing about the communications and the telemetry side of the world is just like it is in EDL, it takes so much effort, so much orchestration and conducting of so many people and so many teams for such a small number of minutes to go off smoothly and successfully. So, everything has to go right. Nothing can go wrong for one bit of data to make it -- the spacecraft computer out of the spacecraft antenna, be received by the Mars orbiters, make it from the orbiters back to the dishes of the deep space network, and then all the way back to our computer monitors at JPL. So, there's not a lot of room for errors. It's very exciting.  Host: Well, you know, I think you've kind of mentioned this throughout our conversation today. But you've referred to Perseverance as she. And I think -- you know, correct me if I'm wrong, but it seems like, you know, because of that pressure, because of all of the -- all of your work going towards this one moment, you all in your own kind of special way have developed a connection to the rover. And in a way of kind of personifying it and making it into some kind -- instead of just a piece of hardware, something that you as a team can connect with and really engage with throughout this critical moment.  Chloe Sackier: Yeah. I think that's fair. There's definitely a significant amount of personification going on. But I've heard teammates refer to this spacecraft as like their baby or their child. Some people think of it as an old friend. Or maybe a dog. But everyone relates to it in a different way. But it goes without saying that it is incredibly meaningful to every scientist and engineer who's gotten the amazing opportunity to work on this project. So, it's, you know, it manifests itself in different ways.  Host: So, you came to JPL after Curiosity, that's correct?  Chloe Sackier: That's correct, yes. Actually, I remember watching the Curiosity, the entry, descent, and landing in my bedroom, in high school. And thinking like “wow, those people are really cool. I wonder how I figure out how to do what they're doing.”  Host: I watched it too. I was watching it during an internship, and I watched it live. And I'll remember, you know, one of the highlights of the whole thing was, you know, you were just watching, you were just watching the control room and all these faces just glued to their monitors. And of course, the big moment that I think everybody that watched that live remembers was the celebration. Jumping up and down, the high fives. That's something that you get to be a part of now.  Chloe Sackier: It will of course, look a little different than the jubilant celebrations of the past, and what the celebrations in mission control looked like for Curiosity due to the pandemic. So, you know, our first and foremost priority is to keep each other safe. So, it's heartbreaking, but no hugs this time. We'll have to make do with elbow bumps. But that certainly, doesn't diminish the incredible feeling of successfully landing something on Mars. And the pure joy and disbelief I think we'll all feel accompanying that.  Host: Well you did -- I'm sure you did get to learn a lot from the folks who have been a part of that moment before, during Curiosity, right? I mean, the landing looks very, very familiar to Curiosity. So, you have a lot of folks who worked hard on that. And that you learned from. And I'm sure, I'm sure you got to learn from, you know, what to do differently this time around, what to make sure we do consistently that was successful on Curiosity. I'm sure you got to hear a lot of those stories.  Chloe Sackier: Oh, yes, absolutely. I think that's easily the best part of the job is the people that we get to work with. And some of these people have been doing it not just since Curiosity, but decades ago. So, they've been involved with so many successful missions. Their stories are unparalleled. Their wisdom is infinite. Knows no bounds. So, there's a lot of important technical knowledge that gets passed along throughout the generations. But also, just like ways of doing things that you know, you can really only learn firsthand.  Host: Yeah. So, Chloe, what's -- we're recording this, like you said, you know, just about a month ahead of the actual scheduled landing. So, what's on your agenda from now until landing day on the 18th?  Chloe Sackier: Right now, as we are recording, we are in the middle of our final operational readiness test, which we also call our EDL dress rehearsal. Up until this point, we've been, as we talked about, simulating and practicing on the spacecraft all sorts of different situations and scenarios. But now, we're at the point in the mission where we have to train ourselves. We have to train the team to make sure that we are ready to deal with any sort of situation we might encounter. So, we're stepping through all the motions of those final few days before EDL. So, getting the spacecraft ready for EDL, getting to the right place to start at the right time. Telling the spacecraft what it needs to know. So that's that process of Trajectory Correction Maneuvers and parameter dates. And that cyclical sort of undertaking. And then of course, in a few weeks, we won't be practicing anymore, we'll be doing that process for real.  Host: There you go. Now you're going to have your celebratory, you know, elbow bumps as you mentioned. Socially distant celebration. I'm curious, what's your role after -- you know, you've been working up to this moment, right? Entry, descent, and landing. What's your role after EDL?  Chloe Sackier: We go through a process where we try and make sure we understood exactly everything that happened. And piece together the whole story. This helps us prepare and understand things better for future missions and really understand how our technology works. So, we'll be piecing together all those little bits of telemetry and really trying to make sure we flush out every single detail. And then of course, the science will kick off on Perseverance. And the rover will start firing up all those instruments and turning out the mission to search for signs of past life.  Host: A really important thing. Now, Chloe, this is, it's been a whole lot of work for you. And I know, I can sense your excitement through for getting ready for this moment. You know, kind of, let us in on some of the culture. Some of the, you know, not necessarily secrets, but just the behind the scenes of just working at JPL, you know, working with the teams that are working on this rover. And just the culture that you have there to put together a mission like this.  Chloe Sackier: Yeah. I think it's an amazing culture. There's an expression at JPL that we \"Dare mighty things.\" And I think to accompany that sort of mission philosophy, you have to have a tight knit culture. And a group of people that are really supportive, but also really push each other to do our best and put forth our best ideas. It's a little cliché to say, but I truly feel like the EDL team itself is so much more than just a team. It's a family in every sense of the word. It's a group of very interesting, very diverse, very wonderfully weird people. But I feel like we all complement each other so well. Of course, in the pre-pandemic days, we used to get up to all sorts of hijinks. We had goat yoga and axe throwing and laser tag. I remember one holiday season, we all acquired NERF guns for some reason and then there was a solid two or three weeks where we were just chasing each other in circles around our floor, our cubicle area. And being very productive. [Laughter] But it's a very tight-knit team. It's been the honor of a lifetime to work with them and learn from these incredibly accomplished people.  Host: Yeah. I think you need that, right? Because you're working so hard on something so complicated. And to have -- and to have that kind of culture that brings you all together to make sure you're getting the job done I think is a wonderful thing.  Chloe Sackier: Exactly. You have so many late nights in the test bed. It really helps to actually like the people that you're working with. It makes a difference.  Host: Well, Chloe, from here at the Johnson Space Center, we're going to be watching intently for the landing itself. We'll be rooting for you and of course for Perseverance and all the great science that it's going to do after this critical seven minutes of terror, the entry, descent, and landing phase. Looking forward to everything we're going to be learning when that rover actually starts doing its mission. Chloe Sackier, thank you so much for coming on Houston We Have a Podcast. And describing in detail all the wonderful things that we get to look forward to. I know I feel prepped and ready and know what to expect for when I'm watching the real deal live on the 18th. So, best of luck to you and of course to your team.  Chloe Sackier: Thank you so much. It's been really fun hanging out.  [ Music]  Host: Hey, thanks for sticking around. I really hope you enjoyed this conversation with Chloe Sackier on what's going to happen during the entry, descent, and landing phase of Perseverance's journey to the Martian surface. Now, we are doing this podcast specifically on EDL for Perseverance. In fact, you can check out another one of our episodes, 174, we -- that one's called \"Sticking the Landing on Mars.\" We talked with some experts about what happens when you add the human element to landing on Mars. But we are just one episode of many through all of the different NASA podcasts we have across the agency. Check out some of their episodes as well. We've got “Curious Universe,” we got “Gravity Assist,” and they're going to be talking about different elements of the -- of Perseverance, some of the science, and some of the sounds, some interesting parts of the mission. This is EDL. So, make sure you check out some of those podcasts. You can go to NASA.gov/podcasts to check out any of those episodes. If you're curious about the Perseverance rover itself or want to learn more about Mars or its objectives, there's a good website for that. Mars.NASA.gov. And of course, click on the Perseverance rover. Now, if you want to watch the landing live, we talked about watching it live, we're putting this out ahead so that we can tell you exactly when it's going to land it is landing 3:30pm Eastern time, 12:30pm Pacific. And the broadcast is going to start 30 minutes before landing, 3pm Eastern, and noon Pacific. So, make sure you tune in right on time and watch the whole thing, especially those seven minutes of terror. You can follow us, Houston We Have a Podcast, on social media.

                        "description": "Pat Ryan (Host): Houston, we have a podcast. Welcome to the official podcast of the NASA Johnson Space Center, Episode 187, “The View from Mission Control.” I'm Pat Ryan. On this podcast, we talk with scientists, engineers, astronauts, all kinds of experts about their part in America's space exploration program. Today, we're going to give you a peak at the operation of the International Space Station flight control room. Every single American spaceflight with an astronaut onboard, starting with Freedom 7 in 1961, has been run by a team of specialists in a Mission Control Center, which has been located here in Houston since 1965. Rather than make astronauts responsible for coordinating all the aspects of the spaceflight while they are flying it, engineers with expertise in all the relevant systems work together in one location to move a mission towards its goals. A team is on console in the flight control room any time there is an American mission in space, which has been the case since the launch of the first element of the International Space Station in 1998 and the arrival on orbit of the first permanent crew, a little more than 20 years ago. And NASA has sponsored a series of panel discussions in recognition of that 20th anniversary of continuous human presence on the station. We brought you the first of those, our episode 184 last month. And today, we bring you a talk focused on the work done by Mission Control Houston. The moderator is NASA public affairs specialist Brandi Dean, from the Johnson Space Center in Houston. She's also a mission control commentator. And she'll introduce you to the Deputy Director of Flight Operations here at JSC, Norm Knight, the Chief Flight Director, Holly Ridings, and the Deputy Chief Flight Director, Emily Nelson, Flight Director Pooja Jesrani, former Flight Director, David Korth, and International Space Station Deputy Program Manager, Kenny Todd. For a great look at an element of American spaceflight you don't always get to see. So here we go.  [ Music]  Brandi Dean: Hello and welcome to our ongoing celebration of 20 continuous years of human presence onboard the International Space Station. I'm NASA Public Affairs Specialist Brandi Dean. On November 2nd, 2000, the very first expedition crew arrived at the International Space Station and since then there have been an unbroken string of 241 astronauts from 19 countries onboard supporting science experiments, performing spacewalks, and teaching us how to live long term in space. But although the crew members in space might be the most visible piece of that puzzle, they are only a tiny percentage of the many, many people who have to work together to make sure missions are safe and successful. We're here today with some of the people that work on the ground, and in particular, through our Flight Operations Directorate, and we have a few International Space Station program stowaways here with us as well. I'm going to let each of them introduce themselves and tell a little bit about what they do, and then in honor of the anniversary we're celebrating, I'd love for each of you to also tell us where you were 20 years ago -- when Expedition 1 was just beginning. And we are going to start first with Norm Knight.  Norm Knight: Well, let's see, Brandi. It's really an exciting day, and it's great to be on this panel. A little bit of my background. I've worked in Flight Ops for many years. I'm currently the Deputy Director of Flight Operations. You know, thinking back 20 years ago, which some days it seems like yesterday and some days it seems like a long, long time ago, I had been group lead for one of the shuttle groups that managed the main engine, solid rocket boosters, and external tank, and was recently selected as a flight director, so I was really transitioning from shuttle to station. So exciting times, exciting memories, and I look forward to the rest of the panel discussion today.  Brandi Dean: Definitely. Thank you, Norm. Now we're going to go to Kenny Todd.  Kenny Todd: Hey, good morning, Brandi, and good morning to the rest of my esteemed colleagues on the panel. It's good to see all of you. I'm the deputy program manager for the International Space Station. Have been for a number of years here. But, work very closely with the entire Flight Operations community and have done so for close to the last 20 years now. When I think back to where we were -- where I was 20 years ago, obviously I wasn't in this position, but at the time, my focus was over in avionics and software. And one of the biggest challenges for a program such as this one, where you have hardware literally being built all over the United States and other parts of the world by different countries, one of the challenges was trying to figure out how to integrate all that hardware and software, and it was a big effort in that time frame back ending the last century when we were really starting to get this program off the ground, and in orbit. And so at that time, I had one camp working real-time operations on the avionics and software side, making sure everything was going OK on orbit as we -- as we started to bring up these different systems, and at the same time I was off trying to figure out the next flight in the queue, and how to make sure that we were all going to be good to go and trying to find problems on the ground so we didn't have to find them and give them to these -- to these flight directors later on when they have to deal with them. And again, good to see everybody.  Brandi Dean: I'm sure they appreciate that early work. Next up is Holly Ridings.  Holly Ridings: All right, well, good morning, everybody. I'm Holly Ridings. Today, I am the Chief Flight Director in the Flight Operations Directorate and it is pretty exciting to sit here today, you know, after 20 years and look back. You know, see some of the same faces on this panel, and really have an opportunity to celebrate everything that we've done, and so today, I'm the Chief Flight Director, but if you go back 20 years, I was just starting out at NASA as a Flight Controller, just newly minted, and was able to sit console for the very, very beginning of space station. And so for a while, I would tell everyone I had the entire history of space station in my head, and now it's gotten so complicated, I don't think I can remember it all, but for a while I could -- I could go flight by flight by flight, and that was how I organized my whole life. Not birthdays, not holidays. Space station flights for the milestones, and really still are, actually. That's kind of how we mark time in our world, so super exciting to be here, and I hope you enjoy what we talk about today.  Brandi Dean: Thank you. Next, let's go to Emily Nelson.  Emily Nelson: Good morning, and hey to everybody. So, let's see, right now, I'm the deputy Chief Flight Director in the Flight Operations Directorate, and we're still also Active Flight Directors. 20 years ago, I was also starting out as a Junior Flight Controller. The Expedition 1 launch marked a transition where one role that we had early on was going to retire because the space station, which had actually been in orbit for a while was going to have people on it, and so we were going to retire one position and move into a full team, so I was excited to be transitioning into additional responsibility and getting maybe to become a little more senior as a Flight Controller someday, but I was a pretty baby Flight Controller back in that point in time.  Brandi Dean: That's so cool. How about we go to David Korth next.  David Korth: Hey, good morning. It's good to be back among friends. I hung up my Flight Director spurs several years ago, so now I'm the Deputy Manager of the ISS Avionics Software Division, what Kenny was doing 20 years ago. 20 years ago, I was sitting console in what we call the blue FCR, a much smaller version of what's behind Emily right now, and I was the Lead Planner for Expedition 1, and so, you know, I looked back, and I was reflecting these last couple of days on what we've accomplished since then, and thinking how much preparation went into Expedition 1. And as Emily mentioned the uncrewed station that existed for a year and a half, two years before the Expedition 1 crew showed up and how much work effort we all put into working with the Russians trying to come up with what the plans were going to be, how we're going to integrate things together, and when we finally cut our first plan and uplinked, that's when, you know, this is real. This is actually happening. So, and clearly a lot has transpired both with all of our partners, and the vehicle itself, and the evolution of operations, so I'm glad to be a part of this group today.  Brandi Dean: Must have been such an exciting time. Finally, we're going to go to Pooja Jesrani.  Pooja Jesrani: All right, good morning, everyone. I'm happy to be here with all of you. Like Brandi mentioned, my name is Pooja Jesrani, and I am a Flight Director. I was selected in 2018, so I am one of the newer flight directors in our office. I was selected with five others making a class of six. And so, I am, you know, one of the baby flight directors, you would say, but have had a lot of experience now at NASA. In 2011-- sorry, I should say in 2000, I was in 11th grade. I was in 11th grade and had a lot of space posters in my room, and it's -- you know, I was very inspired by space, and wanted to be where I am today. So very excited to be here. Thank you. I saw a lot of heads shaking with the 11th grade, but...  Brandi Dean: Yes, this is already so much fun. So, now we're going to back up a little bit. Although a lot of this group supports Flight Operations in mission control, that's not everything that Flight Operations does by a long shot. So, Norm, since you're the deputy director of Flight Operations, why don't you give us an overview of what Flight Operations Directorate is.  Norm Knight: OK, Brandi, and 11th grade. Goodness, that's a shocker. So, Flight Operations, we live in a lot of acronyms, so you hear FOD, it's synonymous with Flight Operations, it's Flight Operations Directorate. And really, what we are, is a service organization for all the major programs. For development and mission execution. And so, what I'll talk a little bit about and give you an overview today is really for station, but it does support all programs, and you know, the program is our customer. We're an org of about 2,500 people, and we have three major functions within Flight Ops. You can think of us as kind of like a tripod. One leg of that is our astronauts. We have about 47 active astronauts today. The other leg is Aircraft Operations. We call it AOD, and we have about 60% of the aviation assets for the agency within Flight Ops. We have 19 T-38s that are used for spaceflight readiness training. We have a cargo transport, the big guppy you've probably seen flying around. We have some high research aircraft, used for science and training, and then we have a Gulfstream III and a Gulfstream V, which are used to transport the crews home after landing and get them back reunited with their family. And then we have the plan, train, fly part of the organization, which is really the biggest part of FOD, although it all works together, but really that plan, train, fly is what we do for the program. We really start planning and training each of these ISS increments, which are about six months long, about a year and a half out, and the teams work very hard to take the program requirements, metabolize those into a plan, a very detailed plan of how to accomplish this. We train the astronauts, we train the flight controllers, we integrate the teams, and we get ready to go in and execute that in the real-time environment, and that plan really starts from when the astronauts leave their families to go to launch all through all activities on orbit to the time that they come back to Earth and are reunited again with their families. Where you see a lot of this really culminate is in the Mission Control Center. Many of you have probably seen mission control, whether you've seen it in person or in photos. That's the command and control center for the International Space Station. These teams work 24/7, 365 days a year. The Flight Director is really the conductor in these real-time teams, managing all the systems onboard, and the purpose of the teams in there is to manage the systems and also to provide crew safety for this orbiting laboratory in real-time. The teams typically send about 30,000 remote control commands from the ground to the space station a month to manage this platform. So, it's very interactive, it's hands on, it's tactile, and it's very rewarding. You know, Flight Operations, we're very rich in tradition, we have our foundations of what we call foundations of Mission Operations. They're leadership tenets, not unique to FOD, as we say, but really, for any effort that requires leadership. It's discipline, confidence, competence, toughness, teamwork, vigilance, and responsibility, and to see leadership attributes that define our culture. And this culture, in addition to the flight rules and procedures, is really what provides the framework for the critical decisions and the operations that are ongoing, as you see in real time today. The teams are trained to expect the unexpected, to improvise and overcome, and to work with a lot of other team members, both here at JSC and other centers, to always ensure astronaut safety, vehicle safety, and achieving the mission objectives that are set forth by the program. And FOD is a little bit unique in that as a support organization, we can knit this together across major programs with international partners, with cargo vehicles, with crew vehicles, and payloads, integrating them all together in both the development and real time environment, again, making it work in support of our customer, the program.  Brandi Dean: I think that sets us up now for maybe Kenny Todd to come and tell us, I think, it might be confusing to people that the people you see supporting flights, sitting in mission control and flying the space station don't actually work for the space station program, so maybe you can explain kind of that relationship between FOD and the space station program.  Kenny Todd: Sure, Brandi. Yeah, you know, the part that everybody sees on TV is mostly astronauts and flight controllers and flight directors, I mean, that is the face of human spaceflight. That -- those are the people you see, and quite frankly, those are the people that we the program have entrusted with this $100 billion international asset, and so, as Norm said, they had the responsibility given to them by the program to train our astronauts, you know, make sure we have a flight control team that's certified and ready to go, and multiple levels deep in failure response, and I think through the course of the history of not just this program, but all programs, you can see that the tenets that Norm laid out today have really been the foundation, which has been used in all human spaceflight programs and been executed very successfully, so anyway, yeah, Flight Operations is from a programmatic perspective, there are so many different facets of the program when you look at the engineering, the safety, you know, the people who manage our spacesuits. It's a huge program. But somebody has to have that responsibility to operate the vehicle day in and day out, and we look to the Flight Operations Directorate to do that, keep the crews trained, keep the vehicle safe and flying in a good way every day. Now we have a control center over in Huntsville, Alabama that their primary focus is going to be making sure that while Flight Ops is taking care of the vehicle and keeping everything safe, that they're working with the principle investigators and getting the science done onboard station. So, there's a nice sharing of roles there, but at the end of the day, we look to the Flight Operations director to make sure that we take care of the vehicle, take care of our crews. And again, we compliment that with a large work force of folks that make sure that we hold each other accountable from the standpoint of the technical requirements or safety requirements, keeping our suits healthy. And so anyway, that's kind of where Flight Operations sits in our bigger, overall program.  Brandi Dean: Thanks, that was a really good explanation. And I think it brings up that you know, this space station isn't the first program that FOD in some form has supported. We've been -- you guys have been working with all the human spaceflight programs pretty much since the beginning. But I think, probably, the space station's first -- that first expedition was kind of a turning point for you guys because, among other things, it meant that mission control had to be open 24/7, 365 days a year. I think Holly and David, you guys were already flight controllers at that point, so maybe you remember a little bit about what that transition was like.  Holly Ridings: Yeah, so maybe I'll go -- I'll go first, and then I'll hand to David because I think our perspectives are maybe a little bit different. Right, so I came in right when we were building up the team of folks, the flight control team, that would work with space station. And so, you know, I didn't start on the shuttle side and then transition over like Norm, and Dave's got some experience as well. So, to me, you know, the 24/7, 365 is really the only world I've ever known. And we supported from the space station side, you know, round the clock. And then, obviously, when the shuttle came up and docked and we did joint missions together, really laying the foundation for so many ways that we partner with all of our international partners and then now our commercial partners as well, and so, you know, I was lucky enough to come and be some of the very first people to get certified on the space station side and learned the ropes from that perspective. And you know, Expedition 1, any time you do anything for the first time, right. You know, there's always excitement but also trepidation because you've spent so much time trying to anticipate and consider how it's all going to work together and then you sort of go live, and then you know, some of it works and some of it doesn't, and actually that's probably the best part of our job, is getting to solve all of those problems, right. That's what all of us love to do after all of the hard work's been put in to prepare. So that's kind of my, you know, perspective on it. You know, you're at the starting gate and you hit the go button. In station, you hit go and you never stop. It just goes. And so, again, you know, after 20 years, that's the only world I've ever known, but I know that Dave and Norm had some more experience on the shuttle side before that than I did, so I'll hand to one of them.  David Korth: Yeah, thanks Holly, and I, when I first got hired into NASA I came in as a -- in the space station operations planning area and we were always 52 months away from launching something. And so, our management said, \"Hey, you know, it might be good for you guys to get some flight control experience if you're going to be part of the flight control team for space station early on.\" So, I got to spend four years doing shuttle flight control and flight planning. And so, for me, I got to see, you know, the heritage of NASA at least when I was young, you know, maybe even as young as 11th grade back when I remember shuttle, and the fact that, you know, I could make a flight plan. And if I wanted to change the flight plan, I took out a pencil, I erased a couple of lines on a piece of paper, I drew some new lines, and then we faxed it up to the shuttle and voila, there's the plan. And that was the change. And then all of a sudden, this new era of international cooperation and, you know, jointly agreed to operations and coordination’s -- all these different words that were, like, you know, certainly we coordinated, and we had international partners fly on shuttle. But now, if I wanted to make a change to a plan, I had to go call the Russians, and then after -- you know, years later, it was the Russians, the Japanese, the Europeans, the Canadians, we all had to agree on what the plan change was going to be. So, cooperation and mutual agreement on how we're going to do things really became important. And so, for me, that -- I saw that transition. And the other aspect, and I know Norm's got some -- he saw this thing, transition in mentality from the U.S. perspective of lot of experience flying short duration missions. You know, and we were even very proud of ourselves with our 16-day extended duration orbiter missions. And then we go talk to the Russians about this new space station project, and they're like, you know, we've been flying Salyut, we've been flying Mir. We know long duration spaceflight. And so, we had this ideological sort of conundrum where we both thought we were right and we both thought we had the right approach, and it was really sort of a meeting of the minds, where we both had to come together. And we brought in some new technology and some new approaches. They brought in years of experience dealing with long duration crews and how to operate something continuously. And so, Expedition 1 was kind of the culmination of all that discussion and began the adventure that we kept learning. And things have changed quite a bit, and the relationships that we've got with the Russians have changed and evolved quite a bit. And then we brought on all of our partners, so I saw that as kind of one of the main benefits to me of being part of the station is opening your mind to a different approach on how you can do things. And, you know, relying on your heritage and your experience, but using that to build something jointly together.  Norm Knight: Yeah, Brandi, I'll add to that a little bit, what Dave and Holly said. You know, the fulcrum was really on the shuttle side initially, and so, like Dave said, you know, our big, long duration missions were 16, 18 days backs on the shuttle. And so, we had shuttle teams up working shuttle. We had station teams working station. And it was a paradigm shift for a lot of the organization to go from these sprints on shuttle really to this marathon on station. And you could see over time it was -- shuttle was, you know, king, per se, and that's the way things were done. But slowly and surely you know, evolution of human spaceflight was really transitioning to station and beyond. And so, the shuttle you could see starting to fade. And even though it was bringing up the cargo, that mentality was, hey, this is the new way for the evolution of human spaceflight. And so, that mentality of marathon is really, it's exactly what we're doing today. It's what we'll use today for lunar and Gateway and Mars. And it really, I think, has provided a good proving ground for this. And we have changed significantly from when we started the station to now. Our whole flight control team model has changed, because, you know, before if we took that shuttle model, you have a lot of people on console and you're running those folks 24/7, it's not efficient. You burn folks out. And so, really, what you see today in the station flight control room from a Flight Ops standpoint is what you get. It's a very small agile team working, again, to make sure that the astronauts are safe, and those mission objectives are being met. And we continue to evolve. So, it's been, it's been fun to watch.  Brandi Dean: Well, the word marathon is a good one. Because the next thing I wanted to talk about was Emily is, I think the record holder for most times spent in -- basically in that room at mission control. She has the -- I think the most shifts for a flight director. So, I think we'd love to hear from her on kind of what a regular day on console is.  Emily Nelson: Yeah, it's maybe a dubious honor. The flight director I took the honor from told me I shouldn't be too proud of having so many shifts in this room. So when I think of, you know, what a day in the life of space station is like, I think all the way back to my -- when I first started working console for space station was actually 1999 as a shift duty officer about a year before the first crew showed up. And so back then, this was an uncrewed ship and you had fairly junior personnel, obviously, keeping an eye on it in the wee hours. And that was really just -- like, I can remember back then, the whole shift was really just about making sure that the -- we acquired comm every rev and that the comm was still working and that nothing looked funny. And that occasionally we'd end up getting a call from our trajectory officers warning us, “hey, there's a piece of debris that might be heading towards the station. You should call everybody and get them working that.” But, you know, super simple operations. And then over the years, you know, you get through the assembly phase. By the time Shep and company were onboard, we -- you know, that was just a little while before the lab showed up. So, then we started doing research. And we started really shifting through the years, you know, through assembly, where you're doing a lot of things for the first time. And any time you do anything for the first time, you're going to learn, maybe, a lot. And you're putting new systems onboard and you're learning about those systems, and you're building this space station one piece at a time every couple of months until you get to a point where you kind of call it assembly complete. At that point, now, for many years, we've been using this amazing platform for research. This is our orbiting research platform. And so, a normal day today looks really different from a normal day on any one of those 21 years along the path. We are supporting our crew members as they're executing a lot of research projects. Those research projects are different every month. We have a seemingly never-ending stream of new research that's coming online and getting to orbit and then coming back home and getting replaced by more. Occasionally, we'll have some systems that aren't behaving themselves, and so our teams will have to sort through those things. Occasionally, research doesn't go exactly as we planned, and so our team in Huntsville will have to work with the crew to sort out why it's not working the way it's supposed to and see what we can do that will still accomplish some science while working around whatever challenges we have. Occasionally, our international partner friends will have issues on their sides of the space station, and so we'll coordinate with them as they're working through the challenges to get their systems back online. Like last night, we had problems with a valve in one of our CO2 removal systems, so we had to work around that. We had our JAXA friends, we're operating their robotic arm on the outside of the space station to get ready for a satellite deploy tomorrow. And we were installing some radishes in a plant habitat so that we can grow some radishes onboard. I mean, it's a really diverse set of activities that are going on every single day, and it's just different every day of the year for 21 years. I don't know how many jobs out there, when you show up for work, you just don't have any idea what it is. You know, it's going to be totally different from the day before. And that's really what has just been so fun about getting to work on space station for all these years.  Brandi Dean: And I love that you haven't even left today yet. So, great background.  Emily Nelson: Yeah.  Brandi Dean: I think Holly had something to add.  Holly Ridings: Yeah, it was only color commentary, right. So, you know, we are all engineers, and so we have this giant sheet of metrics, you know, spreadsheet of metrics. And so, Emily watches the numbers go up and down, and, you know, so last week, she's like, \"Hey, I need to work some console,\" you know, so when people need help, she pitches in. So, she's been actually on the night shift for the last couple of days. And she has to keep the very serious, very fancy trophy for the more shifts on console, which happens to be one of those number one foam fingers like you get at a ballpark. So, you know, we all have very serious jobs, but we also, you know, try not to take ourselves too seriously. You know, we live and work in mission control. All of us are there, you know, almost every day, right. So when you see us do a panel like this, it's easy to hear the stories and think about 20 years, but, you know, we're here because we love it, and we still spend, you know, time in the building on console. You know, Kenny is -- I think Kenny sleeps in his office in mission control sometimes. So, you know, anyway, I just thought I would throw in a little bit of color commentary, so that's it.  Brandi Dean: That's perfect. I love that, a foam finger for your trophy. So, for those who would aspire to such greatness, earlier this year, we had a call for applications for new flight directors. And I know based on the many emails that I got, there is a lot of curiosity about what it takes to be a flight director and then kind of how you learn once you get there. And since Pooja is the most recent addition or one of the most recent additions to that group, I thought maybe you could tell us a little bit about how that worked for you.  Pooja Jesrani: Sure, absolutely. So, my story for becoming a flight director was that I actually interned at NASA back in 2006/2007, and then came back on full-time in one of the flight control groups for the International Space Station. I worked in the [Attitude Determination Control Office] ADCO group, which is in charge of the way the International Space Station basically flies around the Earth. I was in that group for about ten years before I was selected to be a capcom, which is a capsule communicator. A capcom is the person that talks to the astronauts onboard the International Space Station. I did that role again then for a few years and then applied to be a flight director for the International Space Station. I was selected in 2018. Once I was selected, we went through about a years’ worth of training to get certified to sit on console. In that years’ worth of training, we took a myriad of classes. Basically, all of the classes that the astronauts actually take before they fly on station. As well as we did a bunch of simulations. I know simulations really tested the worst day ISS scenarios. And we really hope that those scenarios never happen in real time, but those scenarios really prepare us for those days on consoles where things don't go as smoothly as planned. So, once we got to go through all the training classes, as well as the simulation, we sat on console and did real-time OJT to really learn the ropes of what happens every day on the International Space Station. And after that real-time OJT was complete, we were signed off by our Chief of the Flight Director Office to sit our first shift on console, which was a really memorable day for me because I was able to invite my family and friends to attend my first shift and sort of naming ceremony.  Brandi Dean: So, you've got to tell us now, and then probably we should go around the group, what name did you give your, I'm not even sure what you call the noun there.  Pooja Jesrani: Yeah, sure. Our team name. So, I -- my team name is Unity. And I am the 94th Flight Director in the Flight Director Office. I'll let you go around the horn.  Brandi Dean: How about we'll go -- we'll go kind of in reverse order, David.  David Korth: Yeah, I'm Odyssey flight.  Brandi Dean: And how did you pick that?  David Korth: Well, I've got to relive this moment on console again. For me, it seemed very appropriate because it kind of highlighted the journey that I took that sort of went through a lot of different turns, twists my own Scylla and Charybdis, so to speak. And ended up where I wanted to be, when I started, when my boss asked me when I first got hired, where do you see yourself in ten years, it was a little more than ten years, but that's kind of -- it kind of related to me and personified where I was. Where I -- how I got there.  Brandi Dean: That's great. Emily?  Emily Nelson: Yeah, I'm number 70 and my team name is Peridot. I had -- let's see, there's -- one Christmas, my mom had given me some peridot earrings and I was not familiar with the stone, so I go look it up and come to find out it was a -- it's a gemstone that you have to have an iron rich environment to develop the gem stone. And they're frequently found in meteorites. And so the image I had in my head was of somebody landing on some planet somewhere, someday, and turning over a rock and seeing a familiar stone, you know, a stone that we have at home and then they find it on some planet far, far away. And so, I thought that would be a good kind of reaching forward name for my team.  Brandi Dean: That's a great story. Holly?  Holly Ridings: Yeah, so, I'm realizing that we're going to leave Kenny out, so I'm sitting here trying to think of an honorary name in real-time, but we may just have to take inaction because --  Kenny Todd: I'll just be Kenny. How about that?  Holly Ridings: You're just going to be Kenny? Awesome. OK, so, I -- Viking flight is my name. Flight Director number 62 there's been less than 100 in the entire history of human spaceflight. Less than 100 flight directors, which is why we all know our numbers with this new class that Brandi mentioned coming in we might -- we might break 100, we'll see. Maybe not, but we are getting close. So, I'm number 62, Viking flight. The reason I picked it is before I came to the Johnson Space Center, I actually worked at Goddard Space Flight Center for a little while. And my mentor when I worked up there was a man named Gerald Soffen and he was the project scientist for the Viking landers that landed on Mars. And so, as a tribute to him, by the time I was selected as flight director, he was not alive anymore. Also, as a tribute to thinking ahead, going to Mars, which we all want to do someday. Headed to the Moon with Artemis and then onto Mars. That's why I picked -- I picked Viking.  Brandi Dean: Very cool. And Kenny, yes, sorry about that but if you have a -- if you have one that you want to throw out there now, we can take it.  Kenny Todd: No, I'm good. This is a special group of people and no, I don't want to tread on that tradition for sure.  Brandi Dean: All right, and Norm.  Norm Knight: Let's see, I'm number 51 and my color is Amethyst. And the reason I chose Amethyst, no surprise with the color of the tie here, is I'm a traditionalist more. And so, colors were chosen as team names early on with the first set of flight directors, and so, if you take the first three flight directors Chris Kraft, Gene Kranz, John Hodge -- they were red, white and blue, accordingly. And I'm very patriotic. And so, you mix red, white, and blue together, you get amethyst. And so that's how it came about. So, there you go.  Brandi Dean: That makes total sense. Well, so speaking of kind of the origins of flight directors and going back a little bit in history, I think one of the things that most people think of when they think of a flight director is that, \"Houston, we've had a problem\" line. And dealing with that, the square peg in the round hole. I know that this is a job that can -- that can get your blood pressure going up. So, I think you probably have some good stories and maybe we can start with David, because I know he has a pretty interesting one.  David Korth: Yeah and actually got to share it with Norm. So, we were in the control room at the same time. Yeah, one of my interesting stories on console was certainly the U.S. EVA 23 back in July of 2013. It was a pair of EVAs that we were doing. The first of which was July 9th, so just seven days earlier. And we had -- and we learned through this, we don't have enough time to walk you through the whole series of events that led up to it, but there were a couple of key things that I took away from the experience. First and foremost is to build on what Pooja just talked about. You know, when you get certified as a flight director, you go through rigorous training. Especially rigorous simulations. And the intent of the simulations both for you as a flight director and as an upcoming front room controller is to, you know, quote, throw the kitchen sink at you. Make you -- give you the opportunity to experience those really awful days where a lot of things are going wrong. How you prioritize, how you make decisions. How you lead a team through, navigate through those problems to come out the other end where everything is stable. You know, that's at least the minimum goal. Everything stable. But what I found, you know, you certainly aren't going to have the opportunity to simulate exactly what's going to happen. But what it does do is it prepares you mentally to deal with things that are unknown because you fall back to your training. You say, \"Hey, I've gone through all these things.\" You're thinking this stuff through your mind. I've gone through many scenarios where bad things happen and you can't just freeze up. You can't lock up, you got to keep thinking. And so, falling back on the training that Pooja had to go through to get certified. And that when we go through for all these different dynamic events, whether it's EVAs visiting vehicles, any other kind of major event that we do on station, we try to simulate and spend time building team, so you understand how you and your team are going to react. Building that kind of trust. And building confidence -- self-confidence in yourself that you can get past a tough situation. The other piece of that is the reliance on team. It's not one person that's going to solve a problem. You have to rely on a team. And to extend that, you know, this particular EVA we had two astronauts outside. Chris Cassidy, who just returned home from a second expedition. And Luca Parmitano, an ESA Italian astronaut who also came back from station for his second tour not long ago. So, kind of the end of the story was it all ended well because they went back. But at the time, what we learned is that, you know, our international partners, we had an EVA with two people. One international, one U.S., and they had absolute and implicit trust in the U.S. flight control team to lead an EVA and to resolve problems. And somebody asked me in the press conference shortly after the EVA you know, did you -- how was the communication with the ESA flight control team and were they concerned? Were -- you know, what did they ask you and how did you communicate with them? And, you know, it made me think and realize that, you know, this partnership that we've created is based on a lot of trust and mutual trust and that we didn't -- you know, other than them following along and understanding that we were running this EVA and we had the best interest of all crew the safety of everyone regardless of what badge or flag they flew under really hit home to me. So the event itself, it took a, you know, we terminated the EVA in an hour, just over an hour into an EVA with something that did not appear at first life-threatening and after -- it was after we declared termination that the event started to go downhill quickly and, you know, there was a little luck involved that we terminated when we did. And that the EVA itself was set up to where the astronauts were not as far away from the airlock as they could have been had this event occurred late in that EVA, where parts of the station would have taken them longer to get back to the airlock. It was certainly traumatic and then certainly when we got back into the airlock and got the helmet off, an hour and 41 minutes PET, or Phase Elapsed Time, you could see all the astronauts on the station, our Russian colleagues, everybody in the airlock doing what they could to help get that helmet off. The goal was get that helmet off as quickly as you can. A liter and a half of water in a helmet when you're in space is, you know, putting your head in a fishbowl. And so, it was great to see the international cooperation there at the very end. I also had the pleasure of working HTV-3 with Holly. That was the Kounotori 3 Japanese cargo mission that ended up aborting when we released it. It was one of those that we berthed, we brought it in and berthed it to the Node 2 Nadir and then we released it with a robotic arm. And a number of different events transpired such that it went forward instead of down. And then that sort of caught our attention there in real-time. But that was working with the Japanese control team. And a lot of communication back and forth. And again, it fell back to the mutual training that we did with our Japanese colleagues to build trust, the cooperation, the understanding of how each of us was -- to react in tough situations. So that when something unforeseen happened, there wasn't, you know, a multinational panic. It was, “hey, we can deal with this and get through this together.” I think I'll stop blabbering on at this point.  Brandi Dean: Yeah, I would imagine there might be some other good stories out there. Anybody want to share kind of the most heart-stopping time on console that they've had?  Holly Ridings: Yeah, I'll do a quick one, right. So, was on console early on. I was a flight director and we were bringing a progress vehicle into the space station. And so, typically that's an uncrewed cargo vehicle the Russians built. It comes up, flies up to the space station automatically. Normally what happens is it has an antenna that moves out of the way when it gets close, such that then it makes room for the docking mechanism to mate with the space station without any interference. And unbeknownst to us on the ground, that had not happened correctly. It had not retracted properly and so, the progress is coming on in and of course that antenna created some structural interference. And so, when it tries to dock with the space station, it didn't -- it didn't work correctly. When you have two vehicles in space and you try to put them together, you do what's called free drift, right. You don't want firing jets moving around on either one of them. They don't go together nice and neat. So, we're in a position where the progress was coming in and the space station is drift. We're trying to put them together, and of course, it doesn't work quite right. So, then we had to figure out what to do. And this is our Russian colleagues trying to figure out how to go ahead and get what we call, you know, structural mate such that now we can start firing the thrusters again. You know, have attitude control of the space station. And so, you know, that story may not sound you know, sort of adrenaline pumping. Maybe when I tell it very technically like that, but this is not something that happens. Typically, we rendezvous lots of vehicles to the space station. It usually goes really well, and so having one where you're unable to finish completing the docking, but also not being able to get off the space station because you've kind of got this incomplete mating. Now you've got your space station in drift. If you stay that way too long, you're not pointed in the right direction, you don't have power, you don't have communication. And so, that situation can start to start to go badly fairly quickly. And so, you know, as Dave was pointing out it's a team thing. And in this particular case, you know, our Russian colleagues worked closely with us to figure out what to do. You've got the safety of the crew onboard, and that's the most important thing you're thinking of in that situation and wanting to get the space station, you know, back to a place that's safe for them in terms of power and consumables. And obviously, this structural mating that's going on. So, sometimes things go wrong, and you have to figure out what to do. In that particular case, we got, we got enough structural mating that we were able to do that. There's hooks, clamps that kind of pull the two vehicles together and get back into a safe state. But it was very sort of adrenaline-inducing for a period of time while we figured out what to do. And you know, Brandi, you always ask these questions and we're all trained to tell them in these, like, super dry, boring voices. You know, because that's what we do on console when things go wrong. And I'm not sure it quite conveys you know, the situation to folks out there. But, you know, I decided I'd try a little bit, so hopefully people understand that you know, that's our equivalent of heart-pounding, where we have these very calm faces and sort of monotone tones, because that's what we're trained to do.  Emily Nelson: Yeah, and just to add some color-commentary to that one, I remember that day because I was with a team that was doing a training run upstairs. And word spread that, because it was pretty unusual for us to not dock totally normally. And so, word had spread upstairs of this. And we pretty much just, like, everybody took a pause and we moved our data from our simulation training data to the real-time data to just kind of follow along, you know, with bated breath from upstairs to see what are they going to do? How are they going to solve the problem? You know, we had a whole team that was following along that really -- it was -- yes, when you describe it technically and, in the moment, you can't get all, you know, we don't make it a big, exciting event. But I will tell you that from another room in the building having nothing whatsoever to do with the op, we were all watching because it was a, kind of a really scary event.  Kenney Todd: And I'll, let's see. Brandi, I'll jump in kind of from a program perspective. I don't sit and do the actual console work. But you know, I look at it from a programmatic perspective. We've asked the Flight Ops team to, you know, take care of the crew, take care of the ISS. And if something goes wrong, you know, my perspective is get us through the shift. Get us stable. And then, we'll step back as an integrated group, take a look and see what our options are. Try to figure out how to go -- how to go forward. And at least one of the examples that I can think of, and maybe one of y ‘all can help me remember. For some reason, I think it was 12A or 13A. We had a shuttle dock to station. And for whatever reason, the Russians had a computer failure. And we thought, \"Oh, no big deal.\" And then, they had another computer failure. You know, like, well that's unfortunate for those guys. And then you realize, well, that's really unfortunate for all of us because -- we need them in order to be able to stabilize the station so that shuttle can leave. And we had absolutely no clue as to what happened with the Russian computers. The Russians didn't really have a good understanding. There was -- there was a lot of concern. I'll put it that way because we were really in a situation where we couldn't keep shuttle forever trying to figure out what to do. We were concerned about overall maintaining attitude control should we try to undock and not have these computers that could control the propulsion systems. Pooja, you probably remember this. But anyway, so anyway, I just remember that was a very concerning time for us at the program level because we were still building station. You know, we were still quite a ways from being done and to have a problem like this where you're really looking at each other going, \"How are we going to get out of this?\" I mean, this could you know, be a step in a very bad direction if we try to let shuttle go and not have a good way of ensuring that we can clear it from the station without any kind of contact. So, it was at least over a period of days. It was something I think a lot of us lost sleep over working with the entire team, engineering, our operations team, our safety communities, our partners, our Russian partners trying to figure out, because it wasn't just as simple as rebooting that computer and bringing it back up. It was a much more involved technical issue that again, kind of felt like it brought us to our knees there for a period of days and I assume some of you might have remembered that one.  Holly Ridings: Yeah, so I'll pick up for just a few minutes because I was actually on console. I worked that -- I worked that mission from the Flight Director Console. It was actually my very first joint, you know, joint mission. So, I'd been certified before that and I worked space station shifts, but that was my first joint mission on the ISS flight director team. So, I came in, I was the crew overnight shift. We put the crew to bed, and I came in, and the lead of our team said, \"Well, we're in free drift and we can't figure out how to get out of it. We needed the computers on the space station to work and then be able to hand back and forth in terms of the shuttle taking overall control of the combined space station/shuttle. But we were trying to get back to where the space station, you know, took control of that. Like Kenny said, we couldn't have the shuttle do that forever. And so, I came in and we're free drift and we don't know how to get out of it. But here's the lesson I learned, right. So, one of the more senior flight directors was the lead. And she looked at me and said, \"OK, so while we're figuring out how to get out of free drift, you know, what else can you do?\" We actually needed to move the mobile transporter which is a piece of equipment where the robotic arm can ride up and down the length of the space station to set up for an operation the next day. So, you know, as a new flight director you're just -- your kind of like, \"OK, here's our problem.\" You know, she was looking up and out. Like, \"Hey, let's keep moving forward safely while we're still solving this really bad problem over here.\" You know. And it was in my early flight director career, one of the most important lessons that I've learned. What can you do to move forward even when faced with a problem that, right now, you don't know how to solve. How do you move forward, you know, safely, of course. And so, we move the mobile transporter, because we had to be free drift to do that anyway. We happen to already be free drift, while we're over here trying to figure out how to solve the problem. The other piece of that is when you have a problem that big, everyone just shows up. Like, it's amazing. You don't have to make phone calls. People just know, like Emily was saying earlier. The team in the other room's looking at the data, everybody's at home watching NASA TV, you know, people are getting things on their phones now more than they used to because phones are a little more prevalent now. But the data just gets out, and people just show up. What can I do to help? And we formulate what's called a team four where you have another set of folks go really, really focus on that problem. Leaving us in the control room, again, to continue flying the mission as much progress as we can make safely. So, you know, those are like, two of my biggest flight director lessons that I carry with me from that specific incident that that Kenny brought up.  Pooja Jesrani: I'll just add one quick thing. So, I actually started at NASA about two weeks after that shuttle flight and it was the biggest buzz in town. I mean, the amount of conversations that happened after that shuttle flight and all the things that the team had done to recover, I mean, that was sort of my -- getting my feet wet and really learning all about what FOD does. It was a great experience to start learning from.  Brandi Dean: Yeah, that's so cool. I feel like we could listen to your battle stories for a long time, but I know you've got other things to get to today. But I did want to wrap up a little bit by talking kind of about how Flight Operations Directorate is still evolving as we have new programs coming online. I know Holly, you supported the first SpaceX cargo mission and Pooja I think is getting ready to support the first Boeing commercial crew mission as well. So, maybe you guys can talk a little bit about how things are -- how we're adapting to those new demands.  Holly Ridings: Yeah, so you can probably do an entire panel on just that topic, right. Kenny was there as well, Norm was sitting behind me. So, I was the flight director, the NASA flight director sitting in the ISS, you know, flight control room responsible for the very first Dragon that came to the space station. So, this is 2012. To put that in perspective, we've now done over 20 of those, if you count that demonstration headed into the 21st under the space station cargo contract. So, I mean, two-ish a year for the last, you know, almost ten years now. So, amazing to see how far we've come. You know, when you sit through the first time, we've talked about this when we talked about Expedition 1, right. You put in all this blood, sweat and tears planning, trying to figure out how to do this. Again, Kenny remembers all of this. And then you go live, and it doesn't work exactly like you planned. And that's where we really get to do our jobs. That's what they pay us for, right. Is to figure those things out. And so we got about, you know, 120 meters from the space station and our navigation sensors that communicated with the SpaceX Dragon didn't look quite right, so we got to sit there for a little while and figure out how we were going to manage that in order to get the two vehicles to communicate and navigate in -- navigate in safely. And ultimately, we did figure it out. It's another one of those stories we're like literally heart pounding. But, you know, when you tell it afterwards it's like, OK, well, we sat there and calmly worked through it. You know, we had our engineering support. We had the program folks, you know, Kenny was in the other room. Norm sitting behind me, and we figured out what to do and do it safely and were able to bring the vehicle in. We did have to sit, you know, 120 meters from the space station for a while making sure navigation sensors were working correctly between the two vehicles. And so, you know, from my standpoint you look back. And now, where we are with commercial is really amazing. You know, a tipping point in human spaceflight for us to be able to incorporate a commercial partner and bring them safely into the space station. But to us, right, who started, you know, at the beginning of the space station, it was just another opportunity, right. We had done Expedition 1, we figured out how to incorporate, you know, over time, all of our international partners, add their modules and their vehicles to the space station. And this was just one more in a continuum. And so, we look forward now with all of the pieces that we continue to do on space station and, you know, on into Artemis. And for us, that's, you know, continuing to build on the skills and the culture. You know, at the end of the day it's all about relationships, and teamwork, and trust. And you go and you figure out that combination with every partner, with every provider, with every team that we interact with. And, you know, that's really the amazing thing to me about the International Space Station. One of the most amazing things. And so, again, I could talk forever, but you know, Kenny and Norm were there, as well. So, I'll hand to them.  Norm Knight: Well, I'll provide just one aspect of it that Holly hit on. And it's the teamwork, and it's relationships. And, you know, it was a fantastic day to give Dragon birth. But if you look at the journey to get there, that was really what made it special. Because, you know, the commercial cargo came on the heels of the Constellation program being canceled. NASA diverting funds from government type work into more of the private and commercial industries to where NASA buys the service instead of actually building the vehicle. So, that was the forefront of that. And I'll tell you that the -- dynamics between commercial and NASA and government at that point was pretty toxic. It was -- you know, NASA funding has gone down. It was given to commercial; it was just -- the timing was bad, and the environment was not great. And it really took, you know, Holly and her team and Kenny and the programs to really start helping build trust, as Holly said. Because we were doing a lot of finger-pointing back and forth. And it was getting us nowhere. And until, you know, those relationships started to be built, the trust started to be instilled in that you need us, that NASA recognizes that we needed them as well. We're not the enemy, we're the solution. So, are they, and we have to work together. So, we started focusing -- instead of pointing at each other, we're pointing now at a common goal. That common goal of successful commercial cargo. And that is the foundation -- and the success of that is the foundation we're resting on today with commercial crew, it's what we're going into with the Gateway and Human Landing System. And it all goes back to that. So, leadership matters, relationships matter, and people and trust matters. So just a great success story.  Kenny Todd: Let's see, and Norm, absolutely, I agree with you and Holly both. I mean if we look back at when station started, did we know that we were going to end up in this model? Not necessarily. I mean, we sort of had to adapt the mission along the way based on the guidance and the direction that we had been given. And again, that brought some new people into our circle that we didn't know about when we started this. But, one thing I talk to people about up and out a lot is the fact that we have a space station culture. There's not -- every partner, every -- whether it's commercial, whether it's international, everybody brings their aspect of how to do things and how to look at problems and how to look at challenges and how to accomplish things in their own way. But, at the end of the day you have to figure out how to make that work with everybody else. And what ultimately comes out of that mixer, if you will, is a space station culture. And we understand each other. I like to tell people, you know, the technical problems don't really know international boundaries. They don't know contractual boundaries. They are problems you know; you solve them the same way. The physics doesn't change just because you talk a different language. And so, you have to get together, you have to figure out how to work together to do that, and we did it early on with the partners, our international partners. And I think with our commercial friends, we're starting to see that same thing as both Holly and Norm talked about. You know, the early part that storming-forming-norming thing that there was a little bit of storming early on and it took us a little bit, but I think in the end, you know, we had arrived at kind of a cultural understanding of how to get things done, and it's been extremely successful, and, you know, I think it's going to carry us forward, as Norm said, as we start to not just work with our international partners, but also commercial partners and trying to go live around the Moon and go do some work on the Moon.  Pooja Jesrani: Yeah, and Brandi -- oh, yeah, I was just going to mention that I think this is just a very exciting time for younger generations. You know, the last time we flew off of U.S. soil was in 2011 for our last shuttle flight. And so, to get to see DM-2 this summer fly, I mean, it was the buzz around town, it was the buzz around the world, you know, to get to see these astronauts go to the International Space Station and fly off of U.S. soil. And I think the SpaceX team is doing an outstanding job and we have, you know, a flight coming up in the next few weeks as well as Boeing working really hard to do the same thing. So, I think the next few years are going to be super exciting.  Brandi Dean: Definitely. A lot of excitement these past 20 years and a lot more excitement to come. I think we are just about pretty much out of time, but I do want to give Norm a chance to just kind of wrap up for us a little bit what we've talked about, today.  Norm Knight: Well, Brandi, great discussion, great panel. And, you know, I don't know how many folks have had the opportunity to go out and see an ISS viewing. Where you go out, look at the night sky, early morning sky, and see a station fly over. But if you've not had that opportunity, go do so because, you know, the station didn't happen on its own. It was, you know, one vote in congress, it took a lot of teams to put this orbiting outpost in orbit. And so, when you look up at this magnificent laboratory that's the size of a football field, it's nearly a million pounds of mass in orbit orbiting the Earth about every 90 minutes. You realize it's real. There's human presence onboard, there's been human presence for the last 20 years and, you know, it really is an engineering marvel. And to me, miracles you know, miracles do happen. When you have a vision, you provide the leadership, the perseverance, the political support, and teams that manage this thing day in and day out and have been doing that for the past 20 years. It's incredible. And, you know, it's a great orbiting laboratory for science and research. And it's also being used as a great, platform for developing hardware that's going to evolve us to the Moon and Mars and beyond. So, this is amazing. 20 years has gone by in the blink of an eye, but the relationships and the teams that have made this all happen are what's going to evolve us to getting on the Moon by 2024, making that a reality as well. So, I think I can speak for all of us that, you know, being part of this is just really special. And just really glad to be here today with our friends and see just what this has become and how it's evolving even into the future. So, I'll leave you with that.  Brandi Dean: Thank you so much, Norm. That's a great idea. Definitely go out and wave at Kate, Sergey, and Sergey as they are flying over. And then later this month you'll get a chance to cheer on the Crew-1 crew as they launch for the space station on their SpaceX Dragon, as well. This is just the second in a series of six panels, so you're going to want to watch out for the rest of this series. Coming up is going to be all about science. That's the next one that we'll be holding, so you can watch out for that. Thank you so much for joining us today and here's to 20 more years.  [ Music]  Host: Well, that was an interesting discussion. I hope you had some insights into the way human spaceflights are managed here on the ground. It was also a nice trip down memory lane for me. I was the commentator on Holly Ridings' planning team during that loss of station control event she described. It was summer of 2007, shuttle mission STS-117 was visiting the station during Expedition 15, it was every bit as riveting as she says. Also, an update for those of you who keep track of these sorts of things. This discussion was recorded prior to the arrival of the astronauts on the SpaceX Crew-1 mission. As of now, there have been 242 different human beings who have passed through the doors to the space station. There's more to come. The celebration of the space stations’ 20th anniversary continues. Our next discussion focuses on the benefits of science research on the station. We'll hear from the people leading the science and research efforts on the station as they talk about the importance of that work and the benefits it's already generated, for those of us who are stuck here on the ground. I'll also remind you that you can go online to keep up with all things NASA at NASA.gov. You can find the full catalogue of all our episodes by going to NASA.gov/podcasts and scrolling to our name. You can also find all the other exciting NASA podcasts right there at that same spot. NASA.gov/podcasts. The panel discussion in this episode was recorded on November 4th, 2020. Thanks to Alex Perryman, Gary Jordan, Norah Moran, Belinda Pulido, and Jennifer Hernandez in pulling together this podcast. And to the NASA JSC External Relations Office for assembling this great group to give us some insight into mission control. We'll be back next week.",

                        "description": "Pat Ryan (Host): Houston, we have a podcast. Welcome to the official podcast of the NASA Johnson Space Center, Episode 189, \"Benefits for Humanity, Science for All.\" I'm Pat Ryan. On this podcast, we talk with scientists, engineers, astronauts, all kinds of experts, about their part in America's space exploration program. Today, we're going to take you inside an important aspect of the mission of the International Space Station. Last November, we marked a full 20 years of continuous human presence on the station. That's continued right up to today, of course, and that's more than 20 years now that scientists on Earth have had the benefit of trained hands on orbit to help them complete science experiments that they just cannot do here on Earth. We're talking about breakthroughs in human knowledge, about pharmaceuticals and biotechnology, and physics, and chemistry, and the new devices that'll help put humans on the Moon in just a few years, and then onto Mars. NASA has sponsored a series of panel discussions in recognition of the 20th anniversary of continued human presence on the station. We brought you the first ones in February and March, and today, we bring you a group chat focused on space station science, why it matters that we can do research in microgravity, the kinds of science we do there, and examples of things we've already learned that are benefiting you and me here on Earth, and how station research is getting us better prepared for the missions of Project Artemis. The moderator is Tara Ruttley. She's the associate chief scientist for gravitational research at NASA Headquarters. She used to be a space station program science office official here in Houston, and she shared her enthusiasm for space station science on episode nine of this podcast. She'll introduce you to International Space Station Chief Scientist Kirt Costello, another former podcast guest, Deputy Chief Scientist Jennifer Buchli, and Marybeth Edeen, manager of the space station program research office. So, here we go.  [ Music]  Tara Ruttley: Hi, everyone, and welcome to our ongoing celebration of 20 continuous years of human presence on the International Space Station. I'm Tara Ruttley, associate chief scientist for gravitational research at NASA Headquarters in Washington, D.C. Over the past two decades, NASA and its partners have successfully supported humans living in space aboard the International Space Station since the Expedition 1 crew of Commander William Shepherd, Sergei Krikalev, and Yuri Gidzenko, who arrived November 2nd, 2000. So, this November 2nd began the 20th year of continuous human presence living off the planet onboard the station. A truly global endeavor, this unique microgravity laboratory has hosted more than 240 people from 19 countries, conducted more than 3000 experiments from over 4000 researchers who are from more than 100 countries themselves. And, the station has hosted a variety of international and commercial spacecraft. Conducting science on the station provides an unparalleled way to address the challenges of moving humanity toward the Moon and Mars, which is what we want to do, while increasing knowledge of engineering, physical sciences, biology, our own planet, and the universe. In the 20 years that humans have lived on the station, we've built our understanding of how we can safely live in microgravity, and work there, and stay there longer and longer, and we've made some pretty groundbreaking discoveries. So today, I get the fun opportunity to chat with my friends and colleagues, who I've worked with for many years in the space station program down at the Johnson Space Center, about those discoveries and their experiences with the science and technology activities happening on the station over the past 20 years. Marybeth, Kirt, and Jennifer, since I joined NASA in 2001, there's always been humans in space. It's for my entire career. Many of those watching now are 20 years and younger, and they can also say they've always been a part of a time when humans have been living in space. Would you please introduce yourselves, tell us what you do for the space station program, and share with us where you were, or what you were doing November 2nd, 2000? Marybeth?  Marybeth Edeen: Hi, Tara, sure. I'd be happy to. So, my name is Marybeth Edeen. I've managed the research office, and our job is to get all of that research that we're going to talk about up into the space station so that it can be executed by the crews. I've been in NASA for over 30 years, and on November 2nd, 2000, I was actually working on the life support systems. I was a life support system manager, and I would've been on console in the mission evaluation room, in the back room, supporting the flight team, watching for the crew to enter the space station, and make sure the little bitty life support systems we had at that time, which were really kind of just fans and maybe some air flow systems and smoke detectors, were working properly when the crew got onboard.  Tara Ruttley: Great. Thanks, Marybeth. And how about you, Kirt?  Kirt Costello: Thanks, Tara. Hi, I'm Kirt Costello. I'm the ISS chief scientist, and also the deputy manager for the research office. And what we do is make sure that all of our sponsors have access to the ISS to conduct research, and make sure that we follow NASA's priorities in laying out how that research gets done. So back in 2000, I had just started with NASA, so -- in fact, that was in September. So, in November, I was probably still learning NASA acronyms at the time, although I've been doing some work before then with some flight software. I was hired on as a training instructor for the electrical power and thermal control systems, and at that time, I remember we were desperately trying to get ready for the crew training, for the arrival of the U.S. lab. So, while the Node was already there, and I was glad that they had access to that module, and the U.S. software to monitor that module, we were working on the next big module -- U.S.  Tara Ruttley: Thanks, Kirt. You know, one thing I remember about being a new employee, too, was learning all the acronyms. NASA has, like, a link to, like, a list of all the NASA acronyms and their definitions for all the newbies like us, and I still use it [laughter] to this day. All right, Jennifer, tell us about yourself.  Jennifer Buchli: Hi, I'm Jennifer Buchli. I am the ISS deputy chief scientist. So similar to what Kirt mentioned, you know, we support science for the ISS program, and specifically, I spend a lot of my time managing the research priorities for ISS, making sure that we are utilizing the space station efficiently, and accomplishing science for all of our sponsors. On November 2nd of 2000, I was living in Austin, Texas, attending the University of Texas, Austin.  Tara Ruttley: Oh, boy, oh, boy, yeah [laughter]. Some newbies, and some of us a little bit more veteran, but that's good. That's what makes us a great panel, and I'm thrilled I got to work with you guys. For Marybeth, I think my whole career somewhere on and off, and then Kirt and Jennifer over the last ten years. So, this will be a fun hour. OK, so I've got some questions for you guys. This is what everyone wants to know, right. And the first one is for Kirt. We constantly say the ISS is an orbiting laboratory, and the point is to do science in space, but why? Why bother doing science in space to begin with?  Kirt Costello: Thanks, Tara. That's a good question. It's really a question, though, for all scientists, and why do we go out into the field to do science? In this case, it's the environment of low-Earth orbit. Low-Earth orbit and space give us several unique capabilities that we can't get to here on Earth. First off, there's the exposure to microgravity. When you have a microgravity environment, this eliminates buoyancy-driven convection, and it eliminates sedimentation. So those two factors no longer occur in physical processes. When you don't have that single force of gravity always pulling down on you, you're able to look at systems in a way that is a little bit less complex, and also where those forces that are masked by the force of gravity aren't able to be observed. So, microgravity gives us a unique opportunity to observe those forces. The second is purely the access to the space environment. In low-Earth orbit, we've got two things, the exposure to space radiation, and the space radiation environment. Understanding how it affects materials, how it affects biology within the space station even -- that's one of the goals for us, to continue our exploration out into the solar system and beyond. And then, finally, having access to external sites on the ISS gives us the opportunity to both look up at the heavens above, and down on the surface of the Earth below. From the astronomy standpoint, we're above the atmosphere of the Earth, and that allows us to do observations that would be obscured by the atmosphere here on the Earth. From an Earth observation standpoint, we have an orbit that covers about 85% of the surface of the Earth, and we also have this special orbit that allows us to go over the same point on the surface at different times of day. So that allows scientists to look into what are called diurnal effects, or what happens at different times of the day. So, you can tease out, through those observations, different behaviors that you really don't get through traditional means.  Tara Ruttley: Yeah, I've been really fortunate to work in space station my whole life, or my whole career. I feel like it's my whole life. My whole career -- and I've been in love with space my whole life, but the really cool thing is, if you're a scientist, those discoveries that you can make that no one has ever made before. That's what the space station offers. Like you said, with gravity gone, anything's possible that you may not have even seen before. So, it's an exciting time to have a research platform that's lasted so long and has given us so much. My next question is for all three of you. Each of you can answer. Many people may know that there are astronauts doing something up there on the space station, but they may not know about the benefits that have been rolling in for the past 20 years. A lot has been going on. The benefits can apply to those of us here on Earth, and also in advancing human exploration of space, so we can go further. Can you each share an example of a benefit that has come from the space station research and technology testing? And I'll start with you, Marybeth.  Marybeth Edeen: Sure. Be happy to. So, I'm going to build a little bit on what Kirt was talking about, about those Earth-observing instruments. One of the real benefits that come from space station is that precessing orbit that he mentioned, of how we cover, you know, 85% of the globe and 90% of the populated landmass. And the beauty of station's orbit is that it crosses the orbit of a bunch of other instruments that are in the sky, lots of instruments that point at a single point on the globe. And so, by crossing our orbit across those with similar instruments, we can cross-calibrate those instruments and our instruments, and then we can really expand those data sets, because we can cross European instrument orbit. We can cross a United States instrument orbit. We can cross a Japanese instruments orbit, or Russian, or even other countries, and then we can take all of those data sets. And we can say, “OK, well, at this point, all of these things -- this is -- you know, this is how these instruments are all related to each other,\" and then we've made the value of those individual instrument data sets significantly greater. Because we've now been able to compare across the whole globe. As Kirt also mentioned, the diurnal cycle, the day-night cycle -- most of these instruments are in a stationary orbit, and they see only, you know, daytime or only nighttime, depending on where they are and what they're looking at. And so, by having instruments on ISS that give you day and night data, then, as you did -- then cross these other instrument orbits and things, you can also then start to tease out even more information about what you've been able -- what the instruments are telling you over time. And the other thing that we've been able to do with these instruments is, some of the instruments are getting very old in orbit. And the one -- there was a number of years ago an instrument that had expected life of -- I don't remember if it was, like, ten years, and it had been up there 15. And they were very concerned about it failing, but it was the, quote, gold standard for calibration of this type of instrument. And so, they put an instrument on ISS, and they were able to transfer that calibration standard to the ISS instrument until the next higher-quality instruments gets into orbit in its own, you know, unique orbit. So, it's been a multiplier of the value of many, many other instruments -- Earth-observing instruments specifically, that otherwise wouldn't have been able to be done.  Tara Ruttley: Right, and observing the Earth for disaster response, or looking at crops, or things like that on our own planet -- yeah, that's a huge, huge --  Marybeth Edeen: CO2 levels, moisture, water vapor, all kinds of things, lightning imaging, all kinds of climate and weather-related activities.  Tara Ruttley: -- yeah, excellent. Our own planet -- thank you, Marybeth. Jennifer, how about you?  Jennifer Buchli: Yeah, so one area that's really active in ISS research is biotech and biological, including pharmaceutical research. So, something that we know from ISS is that structures more readily form 3D structures, in microgravity. So, things like cells adhere together to form 3D structures. You know, tissue engineering is a big area of research, and then another one for the pharmaceutical industry in particular, is protein crystal growth. So, we have done over 500 protein crystal growth, or PCG as we say, experiments on ISS. So, what this is, is these are proteins that are associated with a disease state here on the ground, and they can be really hard to mimic or form and then study here on the ground. They're very fragile, and so, when you take them out of the body, and you try to create them in a lab, gravity tends to pull down and make these structures really hard to create. So, using ISS as a platform, we can help these complex structures form in a way that they are larger, and, you know, have a higher yield than they would here on the ground. So, this really aids in drug design. We've studied this in multiple disease states, Alzheimer's being one. Another one that has been highly successful has been Duchenne's muscular dystrophy. So, this is a disease state with progressive muscle wasting. So, one of the experiments we did on ISS -- we were able to actually grow these crystals on space station, return them, and then a pharmaceutical company designed a drug based on those crystals, which is now in use here on Earth in humans.  Tara Ruttley: That's right. I remember that one. That was our JAXA colleagues, right?  Jennifer Buchli: That's right.  Tara Ruttley: Yeah, that was the first big one that we were really, really excited about, the hidden water molecule. Yeah, that was good. Thank you, Jennifer. How about you, Kirt?  Kirt Costello: Yeah, for those who were wondering when I said, you know, the lack of buoyancy-driven convection, let's paint a little bit of a picture. Imagine you're now sitting around a campfire. That campfire flame is dancing and blazing away, but what you're seeing is the turbulence caused by that convective air flow, and the hot gases leaving the flame itself. Imagine if your job is, as a scientist, to help devise a more fuel-efficient car. You need to know about combustion. You need to understand how things burn, and now, imagine that being your job. Somebody says, \"OK, well, your job is to create a model of that fire right there.” One math model to explain all the dynamics in that fire is going to be really hard to develop. And so, people got the idea that studying combustion in space is going to be particularly beneficial. In microgravity, you don't have that buoyancy-driven convection. So, you don't have a lot of the turbulence involved in the combustion effects. And so, people started observing the burning of flames in space to better understand the mathematical models behind combustion. One of our early experiments in this area called FLEX (Flame Extinguishment Experiment) stumbled upon the fact that they were seeing evidence of burning, combustion, at much lower temperatures than a conventional fire burns at. What they had stumbled onto was an effect called cool flames. This is a very unstable effect on the Earth. You might experience it when you've got an old car engine that knocks or sputters when you try and turn it off, but in space, that becomes a more stable thing. So, you can actually study it over time, and we've done subsequent experiments, both in the FLEX series, the FLEX-2, and an investigation called the Cool Flames Investigation that have generated a ton of data as to how this cool flame actually burns. And what does that mean? That means we're getting data back that could one day help us understand how to design more fuel-efficient engines and burn at lower temperatures more consistently. So, this is a good thing for the environment. It's a good thing for industry. Hopefully, it will develop into these great experiments, but it was all enabled by the fact that you were able to just do this without gravity causing all this turbulent back flow.  Tara Ruttley: Thanks, Kirt. I remember when that came out, too. I remember hearing about the unexpected finding of a cool flame while they were burning liquid droplets in the combustion chamber, and then everyone was talking about it, and sharing the knowledge, and trying to figure out what this was they were looking at. And when they figured it out, it hit -- like you said, it led to a series of whole new investigations, a whole new path of discoveries that have all these applications on Earth and in space. So that was a good one, and I'll never look at my campfire the same when I'm burning my s'mores. I appreciate that. I'll be thinking of station combustion forever and sharing that with the children that I'm making s'mores for. All right so let's move on to the next question. Let's go to Kirt, back to Kirt. Not every astronaut is a career scientist. Some are medical doctors, engineers, and pilots. So how are the astronauts able to do all this science on the station, if it's not their background?  Kirt Costello: That's a good question. You're right. Every astronaut doesn't come to us with a hard science degree, and even though more of them today are coming with that science background, every astronaut that comes to us, I would say, comes to us as an explorer. They join NASA with the vision that they're going to help us explore the universe. And what really drives explorers -- they're curious about the world around them. They're curious about the world, and they turn that curiosity into an action that leads them in discovery. If you think about it, scientists aren't really that different. They use their curiosity to pose questions about the universe, and then they devise experiments that help them test those hypotheses. It doesn't take a lot of effort to really turn an explorer into a scientist. NASA also has a great system of support for our astronaut scientists. From our payload developers and our payload operations specialists, who really help configure the operations onboard, so it's easy for our astronauts to participate in science. The other thing about our crew members -- they're great observers. They're right there in the action, and they're the eyes and ears that our scientists need to understand when something isn't quite going as planned. They have the benefit of being able to jump in there and tell them, “Hey, we're seeing this really neat effect,” and they've done this before in some of our experiments. And then helping the PI (Principal Investigator) remap his or her plans for how to experiment on that, to capture that. They also come in extremely handy when something doesn't go as expected on orbit, and we've had that happen a lot. And a lot of PIs owe their science to the ingenuity of our astronauts and helping them figure out a fix for hardware that goes awry. So, it doesn't take any special background necessarily to do science on ISS. It just starts with being curious. So, if you ask a question, devise an experiment, whether that's in your kitchen or your backyard, you could be the key to the next big discovery on ISS.  Tara Ruttley: That's exciting. Everybody should want to be the next big key discovery to ISS. You hear that, viewers? It could be you. Yes. And everybody's an explorer at heart. You're right. I think there's -- I think that's the thing about space station, too, is having people onboard, like you said, the humans in the judgment calls, in the making changes on the spot, and communicating with the principal investigators on the ground is critical. And then, to mention -- not to mention the fact that not all of our investigations need crew time, right. We have so many of those 3000 investigations that I mentioned earlier that are also automated from the ground, and the crew doesn't need to touch those. So, you don't have anything like that off the planet, where you have human judgment in the mix of even automated instruments. So, very good. OK, the next question is for everyone, and I guess I'll start with Marybeth on it. Artemis -- that's NASA's plan for returning humans to the Moon sustainably over the next few years, the big one. Everyone's excited. The plan is for humans to stay longer than we did during the Apollo missions, so it's really important that we do all the work now, so we can prepare to go. How does the work on ISS prepare us for that Artemis mission, Marybeth?  Marybeth Edeen: So, I came from the life support world, and, you know, on the Apollo missions and the shuttle missions, our life support systems consisted largely of consumable items that we used up. We had lithium hydroxide to remove CO2, but once the lithium had the CO2 absorbed on, it became lithium carbonate. Then you couldn't use it anymore, and you had to put in a new can of LiOH, as they called it. The toilet -- you -- you know, you vented urine overboard, and the oxygen came out of tanks after splitting the water in the fuel cell, or out of tanks for the crew to breathe in. On space station, we've tried to develop life support systems that were what we referred to as regenerative, that would recycle the urine and water -- wastewater into drinking water, that would remove the CO2 but not with a material that was consumed, but with a material that would absorb it and then desorb it overboard. So, we did a pretty good job with space station, and we were able to close -- what we call close the loop -- in other words, recycle a lot of the components. So, our water loop is about high 80s to low 90% closed, right. So, the water that we put up there, we use over and over again, and we end up losing 10% to 15% of the water as waste. And the other 85% is recycled back into drinkable water and used by the crew again. Interesting fact -- the water you drink today takes about seven days to go through your body, and then through the life support systems to be the water you drink again seven days later. So, Sunday's coffee is the same as Sunday's coffee a week ago, and as Sunday's coffee a week from now will be. On the ground, that takes, like, tens of thousands of years, but in space station, it takes a few days. So just, you know, for fun -- what -- but our system on station still is not closed enough to be able to go do exploration, or do a permanent module on the Moon, or go do exploration to Mars. We have to make them better. So, one of the things we're continuing to do on space station is to improve our life support systems, and to try out new technologies that get us even closer to being -- closing our loop. So right now, on space station, the urine is processed, but you end up with a very concentrated brine material, very salty -- think about taking saltwater, which is pretty much what urine is, putting it on the stove, and boiling it away. And you end up with a really salty solution at the end. Right now, that's what we throw away, but if you want to recover the water out of that brine, and just end up with a salt, then there's a way to recover what we call the brine recovery system, to recover the water. If we can do that, then we can close the loop into the high 90%. Then maybe you're getting close to something you can take to Mars. So, the next piece going up on ISS to be tested before we do exploration is a brine recovery system. Similarly, on the air side, for oxygen and CO2, providing oxygen and removing CO2, new technologies that lose less air overboard -- you know, right now, we absorb CO2 on a zeolite material, and then we expose it to vacuum. And that CO2 goes overboard, but if you think about carbon dioxide, it's got an oxygen molecule on it. And gosh, wouldn't it be good to be able to use that for oxygen again. So, technologies to recover that, and just have carbon as your waste material, are other key things we want to test. And those are being developed and tested on station. Similarly, for plant growth -- if you're going to go a long duration, you're going to make a permanent base on the Moon, you're going to go to Mars, going to have to grow some food. Because you can't take all your food with you. So, we're doing a lot of experiments on space station for plant growth, and how to, you know, not just grow them once, but grow them, take them to seed, take those seeds and regrow them, so that you can actually farm in space. So those are some of the key areas where we're using space station to really help us move forward and prepare for the Artemis mission, and for future Mars exploration missions.  Tara Ruttley: Right, that covers the force of life for humans. You've got to be able to sustain human life off of the planet, off of space station, and on this new place, the Moon, for longer and longer -- for staying there longer. Jennifer, did you have anything you'd like to add to that?   Jennifer Buchli: Sure. You know, one area that we're taking a look at is really from the human health perspective, too. So as Marybeth mentioned, you know, we need to grow plants. We need to have food crops. We also need to understand how those things affect our astronauts in space. And so, you know, in recent years, we've started extending their missions on space station. So, when we first started, we were really keeping to, you know, six-month missions, and recently, we've done several that are almost a year long. So really, you know, how do humans adapt as they spend longer times in space and off the planet? So, we've talked about, under Artemis, we're going back to the Moon. We know we want to stay there for longer periods of time, and then eventually go on to Mars. And so, we need to take a look at, you know, physiology, how we can support our astronauts with the best countermeasures to make sure that they're successful. They're going to have these really interesting gravity transitions of going from 1 g to zero g, and then either to lunar or Martian gravity. So, you know, what does their performance look like, and how do we support them operationally? And then also, you know, physiologically as well, with, you know, food or nutrition, and things to help them optimize their performance and their success.  Tara Ruttley: Right. Thank you, Jennifer. Kirt, did you have anything you'd like to add to that?  Kirt Costello: Sure. Switching gears just a little bit, new programs require testing lots of new materials, and space station is a great place to allow for the testing and performance of new materials in a non-critical situation. We want to know how a material holds up, what its properties are, what happens when you expose it to atomic oxygen, radiation, solar particles, x-rays, before you have to use it in a critical space application. So the ISS provides a great test bed, and it does it through one of our commercial partners in the MISSE platform, which stands for material science in space, that allows us to go out and test these coupons of test materials, and get them ready for their next missions. We also consider, you know, well, what kind of contamination do we have around space vehicles? We've got contamination that comes off the visiting vehicles, and we want to know how that's going to impact instruments, but we also have this potential question of does humanity carry contamination of its own biome with it on space vehicles? So we've got some investigations coming up to help us understand -- hey, what kind of materials collect on the outside of the ISS over time, and are there living materials that could be a question as we go to the Moon and other places, in terms of the sterility of that atmosphere? So, there's a lot of different ways that ISS can help support these exploration goals moving forward.  Tara Ruttley: Great. Great. Thank you, Kirt. Jennifer, I want to go back to you, because you talked a little bit about the human body. And there will be lunar gravity. There will be Martian gravity. Right now, our crew have been in microgravity. So, what are some of the changes or adaptations that happen to the human body that we need to understand as they stay longer and longer in space, at least in microgravity?  Jennifer Buchli: Yeah, so, Tara, just as you said, what we see is that the human body actually adapts to microgravity. So, this is really interesting. The physiological responses kind of meet the environment that people are put in. So, you know, NASA has developed extensive countermeasures to keep astronauts healthy. So, one of the things that we would see without that is you would see muscles atrophy. You would see bone loss, and so, our astronauts exercise every day for long periods of time to help mitigate that loss of bone and muscle. And they don't necessarily need it as much in microgravity, but that's really supporting their health when they come back to Earth. So that's -- like we talked about, those gravity transitions, that can be really hard when you have to adapt back to experiencing gravity. We also see astronauts have blood volume changes. So, without gravity pulling your fluid in your body down, you get this fluid shift upward. And so, people talk about when they first get to space, or on the space station, that their photos and their pictures -- their face will look a little bit puffier, and that's because the fluid in your body starts to rise up. And then your body starts to realize it doesn't need as much fluid. It's not fighting against gravity and having to pump against that to get fluid and blood in particular to your brain, so you start to lose the fluid. And then, more recently, researchers are starting to take a look at the immune system. This is a really active area of research -- and see how that changes in an isolated environment. So, some of these physiological changes that you see in astronauts, you can also see in model organisms. So, with things like mice -- these are good model for physiology, and how you can take advantage of that for things like muscle wasting and osteoporosis and do research in those areas in microgravity.  Tara Ruttley: Thank you, Jennifer. Yeah, the human body is really efficient, so it's use it or lose it, is what it is, right. OK, so the next question is for Marybeth. CubeSats -- CubeSats, these cute little CubeSats -- we hear a lot about them, especially over the last few years, tiny little things. What are they? They've been an exciting development. What's a CubeSat, and why is it important in science, and even in developing the low-Earth orbit economy?  Marybeth Edeen: So, a CubeSat is just that. It's a cube-shaped satellite. It's 10 centimeters by 10 centimeters by 10 centimeters. That's one unit. They call it a 1U, but then you can gang them together, and you can make 2Us, or 3Us, and now they do 6Us, and 9Us, and they just keep making them bigger and bigger. And then you start going, that's not a CubeSat anymore. That's a satellite, but that's a different story. So, the beauty of them is, they've been standardized. They were developed by a professor out in California, and of course, his name is escaping me for just a moment, but I'll remember it in a minute. It's the smallest type of satellite, and it allows you a cheaper way to perform science and technology demonstrations in space. The size of it, the 10 by 10 by 10 centimeters, was originally set because that is the smallest trackable object that the space command guys could follow, right. And so, you wanted to know where the thing was, so that you knew if it was going to run into something, most notably for us, space station, because we really don't want CubeSats to run into us. And anything smaller was not trackable by the ground system. So -- but you can do an amazing amount of things with them, and because they've become standardized, there's now standard communication boards that you can just buy from a company and drop in a communication board. Or you can drop in a -- you know, a different kind of electronic board to provide you different instrumentation and data. Or you can drop in a standard camera, if you want to be taking pictures. And so, it kind of is like going to the model rocket shop and buying different bits and pieces and putting them in your CubeSat. They've been used for technology demonstrations of different new technologies. They've been used for putting fluidics in, which are really micro -- small amounts of fluid and living materials, and testing out how cells and things react, and how they grow or not in microgravity, and in the space environment. They've jump started research in a number of areas. The biggest area they've been used in, though, is satellite companies, using them mostly to be able to quickly mature their technology and their cameras, and data systems, and optics to be able to get a coverage of the entire globe and get data on how the world is changing with just visual cameras data every day, you know, over time. So, companies like Planet and Spire have been grown up out of this CubeSat market. On space station, there have been a number of companies who have deployed CubeSats. There have been now more than 250 deployed from station, initially with Nanoracks and our JAXA colleagues, and now Sea-OPS and some others have started. But because they're standardized, because they've miniaturized a lot of things, they're pretty cheap, and so, that's made them very powerful for learning experiences. There's a lot of senior-level design classes in universities, and the students in aerospace -- they have to build a CubeSat. And then there was a big problem with -- there's all these CubeSats on the ground, and they couldn't get launched. So, NASA started the CubeSat Launch Initiative, and we started taking those in from academia and finding ways to deploy them. A lot of the ones deployed from station were part of the CubeSat Launch Initiative, where we allowed academics who otherwise couldn't afford to launch their CubeSats, because launches are still very expensive -- a way to get those student experiments into space. If they're commercial, then we've said, \"Yeah, you got to buy your opportunities.\" So -- but all of this new business was really the first business case that developed from some idea to actually generating revenue, making money for the low-Earth orbit economy. It was kind of the unexpected first product or thing that could be sold, and I'll tell you -- for some of us, it was completely unexpected. Well, for all of us, it was pretty much unexpected and very eye-opening, and for some of us, it was kind of frustrating. Because I used to tell people, look, we didn't build this amazing science platform to open up the back door and throw stuff out. But that's what we were doing, was throwing stuff off the back porch, and -- but it was important. Because it was a different kind of science than we envisioned, but it was also, you know, commercial, and generating revenue, and really revolutionizing an industry. So sometimes, you have to get comfortable with using the platform in ways that you really didn't think of, and that when they happen, you just look at and go, \"it's such a waste of such a cool platform.” [laughter] And realize it's not a waste. It's just a very different idea that you had when you started, and that's OK.  Tara Ruttley: Thanks, Marybeth. I remember the first time I was hearing about the CubeSat program, and the way they work is, you put them on a rocket. You package them up. You put them on a vehicle that launches to station, and then you load them in this launcher, which is like a soft cannon, and, poof, they just go out. They go away from station, and I remember thinking, like you said, they want to what? Like, shoot something out of the back of space station? Like, that's insane, but the really cool thing about working in station is, we do these things, like you said, that, you know, we wouldn't have thought to do, unless you -- I mean, it's kind of crazy. We do the crazy things, and it's really useful. It's been useful for science. It's been useful for low-Earth orbit economy, so it's a really cool story about the CubeSats. Now I have a question for each of you a little bit more on the personal level, and I wonder -- are there any particular stories about your time working in the space station program that have stood out to you, either something happening on orbit, or in training, or on the ground? Let's see. I'll start with, Kirt.  Kirt Costello: OK. I was thinking about this the other day, and a couple of years ago, one of the benefits of being involved in the science program for ISS is getting to go out and interact with all the professional societies that are out there. And one of them that serves the microgravity field specifically is the American Society of Gravitational and Space Research. So about four years ago, I was invited to talk during their scientist career day, and it turned out to be just an absolutely amazing event. We had a ballroom full of high school students and middle school students. And not only did I get to talk about everything cool that was going onboard ISS, but I also got to talk about the path that got me from a very small rural high school in Kentucky to being, at the time, the deputy chief scientist for the space station program. I think it was amazing knowing that those kids in that room were there not because they were getting extra credit, but because they actually had an interest in doing science in space. And it really left me feeling, after talking to them and hearing the questions that they asked, that the next generation of space explorers and researchers is out there. So, I hope that day they were a little bit inspired by what I said, but they also inspired me. They inspired me with the confidence that this field is here to stay, and we've got a great future ahead of us.  Tara Ruttley: Thank you, Kirt. How about you, Jennifer? Do you have any interesting stories of your time in space station?  Jennifer Buchli: I do. So, one really interesting experience I got to have in space station was actually participating in an experiment that we did on ISS. So, for a little bit of background, you know, my background is science, and when I first came to NASA, I actually worked in the flight operations directorate. It was during the assembly phase, and so, we're really focused on constructing space station. And so, I worked in flight operations, and actually, it was in the system for life support. So, I worked on a lot of the regenerative stuff Marybeth talked about earlier. So, after supporting operations for about a decade, I came back to science and started working in the ISS program on the science side. And one of the issues that we were trying to address at the time was how we're changing the operations of how we're doing stuff in the open cabin. And so, I was looking at it from the biology side, on how can we make this more like a ground core lab. And so, I worked with some folks to design an experiment to test some of those things, and it was a really, really amazing experience to kind of be on the other side of it, you know, to see things through the eyes of a scientist, and as a payload developer executing research on space station, and to get that experience. And, you know, coming in the door, you get access to all of the expertise that NASA has. So even though my background is biology, I was partnered up with two of the folks who are our, you know, space fluid physics experts, which was really great to work with. I learned a lot from them, but definitely something that I never imagined I would be doing. And then, you know, getting to sit over in MCC (Mission Control Center), in one of the kind of smaller flight control rooms, and actually talk on space-to-ground to one of the astronauts doing our experiment was just an amazing experience. And all the things Kirt talked about earlier, right, of, you know, collaborating with them as you're going back and forth on -- something might not work exactly right, but, you know, they have suggestions. And so, you're really, you know, kind of partnering also with the astronaut who happened to be a scientist onboard to accomplish your research. So that will always stay with me as just an amazing experience of having the opportunity to do that and get to work with those groups of people.  Tara Ruttley: Yeah, that's a really good -- that was a fun one, Jennifer. I loved watching that, because like I said, I've followed space my whole life. And every scientist knew you couldn't micro-pipette in space. It wasn't so easy to transfer tiny little drops of fluids from one tube to the next, to the next. But when Kate Rubins got up there, and you guys decided to tackle it, I mean, you all tried something different, tried something new, and proved that it could be done. And that's like a breakthrough for science. Now we can do lots more on station, and that was a really fun time. And you got to be the principal investigator for some of that work, so that was great. How about you, Marybeth?  Marybeth Edeen: Yeah, so I've got three little snippets, all related to the same person and same sort of event. So when I first came to space station science, it was -- I had been working on life support systems, like I said, and I came in to help develop this concept of an ISS as a national laboratory, and bringing in new users outside of NASA and outside of the partnership. And one of the first people that I ran into in this world was a guy named Jeff Manber. And he had put in a proposal to be able to fly his own commercial facility to space station, and to bring in his own customers. And it was built off of the CubeSat concept, but he took that same thing and said, \"Let me put it inside.\" And he called it a CubeLab. And that -- well, that's not terribly creative, but OK. That's fine. And in talking with discussions with my counterpart at headquarters, Mark Uhran, he thought, no, this will never work. This isn't the kind of thing we want. But in the end, he said, \"Sure, go ahead. Sign the Space Act Agreement. Let's give them a shot to fail,\" because Mark was sure that we weren't going to do that. And what Mark didn't know was that that's kind of, you know, the red flag in front of the bull for Marybeth. So, when he tells me to go ahead and do something so that we can see it -- you know, just give them a chance to fail, I'm like, oh, no, no, we're not going to fail now. Now we're going to find a way to make this work. And I really didn't have anything to do with it. Jeff -- and at the time, I think he had one or two other people. And in less than, you know, six months, went from signing a Space Act Agreement to flying their little CubeLab platform with their first customers, who were education customers, people who had gotten students to build experiments onboard. And that was really the beginning of this new kind of world where commercial companies were bringing in their own users. And it was really hard for us to accept that they were going to pick the science, and that it may not be the same kind of thing we would do, that it might be much, much different. And our operations teams really struggled with, you know, what is mission success? What does it mean? Right. Because it's their payload, and it's their thing. And so, we really had to spend time talking about what success means, and what's his job, and what's our job. And in fact, we asked Jeff to please come to Huntsville and talk to the operations team. We brought them all together in a big room, and he flew down. He's based in D.C. himself, and he flew down and kind of explained, \"This is what I'm trying to do. This is what my company does, and this is my job, and this is what I need, you know, NASA to do. This is -- but this is my job now, this part about mission success.” And through the course of the discussion -- I don't remember how it came up, but he mentioned he had flown into Birmingham or Nashville on Southwest, and driven to Huntsville instead of flying the direct carrier from D.C. And somebody said, \"Well, why did you do that?\" And he said, \"Well, because I have to pay for my plane fare, and it's a lot cheaper to fly Southwest to one of these places than it is to fly direct.\" And everybody in the room just kind of went – “oh, my word.” This matters, right, that he's -- difference in a cost of a plane ticket matters to this commercial company, and how much he's spending. And at the end of the meeting, one of the people who was there -- because Jeff had just kind of told his story, and explained, you know, how the world works from his point of view as a businessman. One of the women, Pat, said, \"You know, if he'd have handed out a hat, and we'd have done a collection at the end, I'd have given him money,\" right. Because they were just so -- it was such a different shift in thinking about what this was, and how this was going to work in this new world order. And then, it was a number of months later, and we were all still learning about, you know, things like -- OK, what is the business consideration? What matters to this businessman about this decision we're about to make? We always thought about the business impacts to NASA, and the cost to NASA, but we had not gotten in the habit of asking business questions of our partners, of our commercial partners. And, you know, I was in Huntsville, and there was something going on on orbit that I don't even remember what it was. And they were going to make a decision about some real-time things, and it was regarding a Nanoracks payload. And I remember calling Jeff and saying, you know, \"Hey, look, we've got to do this or this, and this would delay your science. And we need to know, you know, does that impact you? Are you waiting on a payment for when this thing happens, right? I mean, do you get paid when you do this science, or does that not matter?\" And he said, \"Hang on, let me go check, right.\" And called me back a little while later, and whatever the answer was -- and I fed that answer up the line, you know, and said, \"Well, this is what happens if we slide this one, or don't do this one.\" And in the end, you know, the decision came back. We ended up having to slip that -- you know, the answer ended up being no, we were going to push -- slip the Nanoracks work, because other -- some of the other science was -- couldn't wait. It was, you know, living science, and we'd have lost the science. And so, his got pushed, and I called him back and gave him the news, you know, and said, \"Look, I'm sorry, but we're going to have to push your science.\" And he said, \"Thank you.\" And I said, \"What? Thank you?\" And he said, \"This is the first time anyone has even asked the question, and it's been considered in decision-making. And so, it doesn't matter that the answer is no. It matters that you guys are all, as an agency, starting to change your thinking, and think not just about the NASA needs and the NASA costs, but the business cost to those of us who are using the platform and the science all at the same time,\" right. That it was a monumental change in -- shift in thinking in his mind, that the business considerations for his little bitty company were even discussed. It didn't matter what the answer was at that point. It just mattered that we asked the question. And so, you know, for me, these kinds of things where it was like, OK, that wasn't the answer I expected, but that mattered more than I realized. And started us really thinking about changing our culture to really being responsive to the needs not just of the people picking the science, but the people who are implementing the science, the payload developers, and the people who are trying to execute the science, the principal investigators. All of them are part of our community, and we have to be able to work with all of them. So, it's been a lot of little things that really kind of add up, to me, to this -- this is a different world that we're in than we have ever been in before.  Tara Ruttley: I did not know that story. That is really cool and look how far we've come. That must've been about ten years ago, because I remember meeting him as well, right away. So --  Marybeth Edeen: Yeah, we signed a Space Act Agreement on 9/9/99.  Tara Ruttley: -- yeah [laughter].  Marybeth Edeen: Or 9/9/01. I guess it was 9/9 -- 9/9/01, something like that.  Tara Ruttley: '01, yeah. Yeah, that's when I joined. I joined in 2009, is when I joined the office. So, you might be thinking '09 -- '09, yeah. OK, so that's cool. And like you said, like, small businesses would've never thought -- I mean, it was not -- all that, it was all NASA using station, all NASA. And now, we started there, and now, we have the whole space station national lab component that offers opportunities for researchers to use the station through academia, and business, and government, and Nanoracks was the first one, right.  Marybeth Edeen: We have ten different companies with 21 different pieces of their own hardware, their own science capabilities onboard, and they are out finding customers, which include NASA and include other parts of the government. And that's a way different world than it was a decade ago, way different than 20 years ago.  Tara Ruttley: Very cool. And it's going to be 20 years' difference as we look forward, too. It's growing. And on that note, I'd like to ask also with Kirt -- I'm going to ask the three of you, but I'll start with Kirt, your final question. What do you hope is the legacy for the space station?  Kirt Costello: Oh, good question. So, I think from a scientist's perspective, we really understand what the benefits of doing research in space are. We talked about them early on, but they can lead to discoveries. There are questions that we can't ask on Earth, because the environment isn't right. You have to do it in space. So, I think the legacy of ISS is, if we can sustain experimentation in that environment -- so if ISS has shown us how to do good science in space, we can continue doing that, whether it's on an extension of ISS or in follow-ons. Because our researchers need access to that, and that's our NASA researchers and our commercial research and development folks. They need access to space. So, I believe the legacy of ISS will really be in terms of low-Earth orbit, opening it up, opening it up to continue to have it as a resource for all of our researchers.  Tara Ruttley: Excellent. How about you, Jennifer?  Jennifer Buchli: I think the legacy of ISS will be a proving ground for exploration. So just the volume of science we have been able to do in the past 20 years, and what we will accomplish in the next decade is going to inform our decisions as we go forward. That's going to help us prove out the technologies we need to go forward, back to the Moon, and especially on to Mars. And so, you know, I think this proving ground is teaching us not only how to do long-duration, long-term operations in space, but also how do we develop the infrastructure, and the capabilities, and some of the systems we have talked about today. And so, I think in the next decade, the work we're going to be doing is going to be so important to set the stage for where we go in the future.  Tara Ruttley: The legacy of exploration. Awesome. And I'll wrap it up with you, Marybeth. What's the legacy of ISS for you?  Marybeth Edeen: So, this is -- may sound corny, but for me, the legacy of ISS is that we've changed the world, and in sort of three keyways. The international collaboration, whether it was through assembly and all the partnerships, or now with research, and all of the research where we are partnering with our research counterparts across the world -- it's amazing what we have learned and continue to learn from each other in working together in ways that we never would have done, you know, 40, 50 years ago. The other way, I mean, that I think we're changing the world is that we're learning things we never knew we didn't know, and we're going to use those things for the betterment of humanity. We won't know what those things are for, you know, maybe a decade, in some cases. We've just started seeing the results and the impact of the research that was done a decade ago, and a decade before that, and that will continue to multiply. And in 50 years, we won't realize how much of the changes in the world came from work that was done on space station. And then, the third way that I really think that we're changing the world is opening up an economy in low-Earth orbit, a place where people can live and work in space. Just like Jeff Bezos and others say, we are using space station as an accelerator, you know, a platform, a springboard to really create an economy in low-Earth orbit so that we can get off of this planet and have, you know, options beyond here. And that's going to be the legacy of ISS. It's not going to be recognized for a while, but it's changing the world, whether people see it now or not.  Tara Ruttley: Beautiful. I see it now. I see it now. [laughter] You're right. It's beautiful. It's going to live on for generations. And with that, I think that was a good way to wrap up the fact that we and future generations are looking forward to several more years of exciting discoveries on the station. You, the viewers, can keep an eye out for more informative and fun interviews like these in our ISS 20th anniversary celebration series. Thank you, Marybeth. Thank you, Kirt. Thank you, Jennifer. I miss you all. It was good to see your faces, good to reminisce with you on station, science, and technology. Bye for now, everyone.  [ Music]  Host: Like I said, there are so many kinds of cool science happening on the International Space Station. I could point you in the direction of more and better conversations at NASA.gov/podcasts. Start with episode nine of this little endeavor, when Gary talked to Tara, or 134 where I spent the hour with Kirt Costello, or on number 29 when Patrick O'Neill from CASIS explained the use of the station as a national laboratory. More detail on individual experiments? I can recommend episode 50, where we learned about how we sequence DNA in space, or number 70 and 176, where we talked about organs on chips. We took a deep dive on the Twins Study in number 87, the Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer on episode [117], and on episode 93, we went to Comicpalooza to talk space medicine with Dr. Beverly Crusher. Honest, check it out, NASA.gov/podcasts. There's more to come on this celebration of the space station's 20th anniversary, for the next discussion focuses on the commercialization of space and of space research, from private companies doing science on the station to the creation of brand-new companies that are building rockets and blazing trails for humanity off of the home planet. That's coming up in a few weeks. I will also remind you that you can go online to keep up with all things NASA at NASA.gov. You can find the full catalog of all of our episodes by going to NASA.gov/podcasts and scrolling to our name. You could also find all the other cool NASA podcasts right there at the same spot where you can find us, NASA.gov/podcasts -- very convenient. The panel discussion in this episode was recorded on November 11, 2020. Thanks to Alex Perryman, Gary Jordan, Norah Moran, Belinda Pulido, and Jennifer Hernandez in putting together the podcast, and to the NASA JSC External Relations Office for putting together this episode of the anniversary panel discussions. We'll be back next week.",

                        "description": ">> HOUSTON, WE HAVE A PODCAST. WELCOME TO THE OFFICIAL PODCAST OF THE NASA JOHNSON SPACE CENTER, EPISODE 18: MARS. I’M GARY JORDAN AND I’LL BE YOUR HOST TODAY. SO THIS IS THE PODCAST WHERE WE BRING IN THE EXPERTS-- NASA SCIENTISTS, ENGINEERS, ASTRONAUTS-- BRING THEM RIGHT HERE ON THE SHOW AND TALK ABOUT ALL OF THE COOLEST PARTS ABOUT SPACE. SO TODAY WE’RE TALKING ABOUT MARS WITH DOUG ARCHER, WHICH I FEEL LIKE IS A GOOD TOPIC TO BRING UP NOW BECAUSE NEXT WEEK, NASA IS LAUNCHING A BRAND NEW PODCAST CALLED “GRAVITY ASSIST” HOSTED BY DR. JIM GREEN, NASA’S DIRECTOR OF PLANETARY SCIENCE. THE SHOW WILL FOCUS ON PLANETS, AND THE SOLAR SYSTEM, AND BEYOND. SO IF YOU LOVE PLANETARY SCIENCE, DEFINITELY SUBSCRIBE TO THAT SHOW. IT'S GOING TO START WITH A TEN PART SERIES ON OUR SOLAR SYSTEM THAT STARTS WITH THE SUN AND GOES ALL THE WAY OUT TO PLUTO AND BEYOND. I KNOW I’M PRETTY EXCITED ABOUT IT. SO AS SORT OF A TASTE OF WHAT YOU’RE GOING TO GET ON “GRAVITY ASSIST,” DOUG ARCHER WILL TALK ABOUT THE FOURTH PLANET FROM THE SUN TODAY ON “HOUSTON, WE HAVE A PODCAST.” DOUG IS A PLANETARY SCIENTIST AT THE NASA JOHNSON SPACE CENTER HERE IN HOUSTON, TEXAS. AND WE HAD A GREAT DISCUSSION ABOUT THE RED PLANET-- WHAT IT’S MADE OUT OF, WHAT IT’S LIKE ON THE SURFACE, AND WHY IT’S SUCH AN INTRIGUING PLACE FOR HUMANS TO VISIT IN THE NEXT GIANT LEAP. SO WITH NO FURTHER DELAY, LET’S GO LIGHT SPEED AND JUMP RIGHT AHEAD TO OUR TALK WITH DOCTOR DOUG ARCHER. ENJOY. [ MUSIC ] >> T MINUS FIVE SECONDS AND COUNTING-- MARK. [ INDISTINCT RADIO CHATTER ] >> HOUSTON, WE HAVE A PODCAST. [ MUSIC ] >> SO YOU’RE A PLANETARY SCIENTIST. THAT’S YOUR TITLE, RIGHT-- PLANETARY SCIENTIST? >> YEP. >> SO I’M GUESSING IT’S EXACTLY WHAT IT SOUNDS LIKE-- YOU KNOW THE SCIENCE BEHIND WHY A PLANET IS THE WAY IT IS-- WHY IT’S A PLANET AND HOW IT WORKS AND ALL THAT KIND OF STUFF. YOUR SPECIALTY IS MARS. >> YEP, YEAH, I’VE BEEN WORKING ON MARS FOR ABOUT 13, 14 YEARS NOW. >> WOW. SO WHAT WAS IT THAT ORIGINALLY FASCINATED YOU WITH MARS? >> SO LIKE LOTS OF KIDS, WHEN I GREW UP I WAS INTERESTED IN SPACE OR BEING A PILOT OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT, OR AN ASTRONAUT. BUT THEN WHEN I WAS, I THINK, 16, I READ A BOOK CALLED “THE CASE FOR MARS: THE PLAN TO SETTLE THE RED PLANET AND WHY WE MUST.” AND IT WAS WRITTEN BY A GUY NAMED BOB ZUBRIN, AND HE LAID OUT THIS WHOLE ARCHITECTURE FOR HOW WE WOULD GET TO MARS, THE TYPE OF ROCKET THAT WE WOULD NEED, WHAT THE HABITATS WOULD LOOK LIKE, HOW LONG IT WOULD TAKE TO GET THERE-- JUST THIS WHOLE ARCHITECTURE OF HOW WE WOULD GET TO MARS, AND THEN ULTIMATELY, THE LONG TERM GOAL IS TURNING MARS INTO A MORE EARTH-LIKE PLACE. BUT THAT’S LIKE THE SUPER LONG TERM GOAL. >> RIGHT. >> SO THIS BOOK CAME OUT, AGAIN, I THINK, IN 1996 OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT, AND THERE WAS THIS BIG COVER ARTICLE IN “NEWSWEEK” AND OTHER MAGAZINES-- IT KIND OF MADE BIG NEWS. AND I JUST READ THE ARTICLES, READ THE BOOK, AND JUST GOT FASCINATED WITH THE IDEA OF HUMAN EXPLORATION OF MARS, AND THEN LEARNED MORE ABOUT THE PLANET MARS. AND WHEN I WAS AN UNDERGRAD, I WAS TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT MAJOR I WANTED TO DO, WHAT I WANTED TO MAJOR IN, AND I WAS THINKING ABOUT, “WELL, YOU KNOW, I THINK I’M KIND OF GOOD AT THIS, AND I’M KIND OF GOOD AT THIS.” BUT WHAT I WAS REALLY PASSIONATE ABOUT WAS MARS AND MARS EXPLORATION. AND I DIDN’T KNOW HOW TO MAKE A CAREER OF THAT, BECAUSE WHERE I WENT TO UNDERGRAD AT BRIGHAM YOUNG UNIVERSITY IN UTAH, WE DIDN’T HAVE ANY KIND OF SPACE RELATED PROGRAM THERE. SO I ENDED UP JUST MAJORING IN PHYSICS. I FOUND A PROFESSOR WHO WAS SIMILARLY INTERESTED IN MARS, AND ANOTHER PROFESSOR IN THE GEOLOGY DEPARTMENT WHO’D ACTUALLY-- >> AT BRIGHAM YOUNG? >> YEAH, AT BYU-- THERE JUST HAPPENED TO BE A FEW OTHER KIND OF SPACE ENTHUSIASTS THERE, MARS ENTHUSIASTS. SO THEY KIND OF POINTED ME ON THE ROAD, AND SO I TOOK AN INTRODUCTION TO PLANETARY GEOLOGY COURSE AS AN UNDERGRAD, AND JUST LOVED THAT. AND THEY POINTED ME ON THE COURSE OF, “ALL RIGHT, HERE’S SOME COURSES TO TAKE TO PREPARE FOR GRAD SCHOOL, AND THIS IS WHERE YOU SHOULD APPLY.” AND ONE OF THE PLACES THAT I APPLIED WAS THE UNIVERSITY OF ARIZONA, WHICH HAS ONE OF THE FEW PROGRAMS IN PLANETARY SCIENCE IN THE COUNTRY, OR ONE OF THE FEW PHD PROGRAMS. AND I GOT ACCEPTED AND STARTED THERE IN AUGUST OF 2004. AND THE REASON THAT I WENT THERE IS THAT THEY HAD JUST WON THE CONTRACT FROM NASA TO DO THE 2007 MARS PHOENIX SCOUT MISSION. >> HUH. >> SO I GOT TO SEE-- SO I WENT IN, AND MY ADVISOR WAS THE PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR FOR THAT MISSION, SO KIND OF THE BOSS OVER THE WHOLE MISSION. SO I WENT IN AS A FIRST YEAR GRAD STUDENT AND WORKED ON THE PHOENIX PROJECT RIGHT AFTER IT HAD BEEN SELECTED. AND SO MY CAREER AS A GRAD STUDENT SPANNED THE RIGHT AFTER SELECTION, ALL OF THE DESIGN WORK, VERIFICATION, ALL OF THAT FOR PHOENIX, AND THEN LANDING, SURFACE OPERATIONS, AND THEN DOING THE SCIENCE ON THE STUFF THAT WE LEARNED ON THE SURFACE. AND THE MISSION ENDED IN LATE 2008. SO I JUST KIND OF WALKED INTO THIS GREAT OPPORTUNITY OF GETTING INVOLVED IN AN ACTUAL MARS MISSION AS A GRADUATE STUDENT, AND JUST LOVED WORKING ON MARS, LOVED THE MISSION OPERATIONS ASPECT OF IT, AND ONE OF THE MOST EXCITING TIMES OF MY LIFE HAS BEEN THE TWO TIMES WHEN I’VE BEEN ABLE TO REMOTELY WITNESS A ROBOT LANDING ON MARS AND JUST THE ABSOLUTE THRILL THAT THAT IS THE 10 TO 15 MINUTES OF, OKAY, THIS IS IT. EVERYTHING COMES DOWN TO THIS MOMENT, AND THEN THE THRILL OF SEEING THE FIRST PICTURES FROM THESE LANDING SITES THAT NO ONE HAS EVER SEEN BEFORE. LIKE IT IS JUST AN ABSOLUTELY AMAZING EXPERIENCE TO SEE THESE PICTURES COMING IN FOR THE FIRST TIME FROM ANOTHER PLANET AND JUST HAVING THAT FEELING OF DISCOVERY AND EXPLORATION. >> I CAN IMAGINE, BECAUSE YOU HAVE SUCH A PASSION FOR IT, SINCE YOU PURSUED IT SO FAR, GETTING A PHD. AND IN PLANETARY SCIENCE, BEING FASCINATED WITH PLANETS AND THEN BEING ABLE TO WORK ON AND LEARN FROM A ROBOT THAT WAS ACTUALLY ON THE SURFACE OF ANOTHER PLANET. >> YEAH. >> THAT IS CRAZY. THAT IS AWESOME. SO THAT MAKES ME THINK-- WHY-- SO YOUR SPECIALTY IS MARS, AND THAT IS A HUGE PART OF NASA’S JOURNEY TO MARS, RIGHT-- WE REALLY WANT TO PUT BOOTS ON THAT PLANET. >> YEAH. >> BUT WHY THAT PLANET? OBVIOUSLY WE HAVE VENUS, WE HAVE-- TITAN LOOKS PRETTY COOL, AND ENCELADUS. WHAT IS IT ABOUT MARS THAT’S SO INTRIGUING? >> SO AS FAR AS THE BOOTS-- IT ALL KIND OF COMES BACK DOWN TO THE BOOTS ON THE GROUND ASPECT THAT YOU’RE TALKING ABOUT. LIKE TITAN AND ENCELADUS ARE VERY INTERESTING PLACES, EUROPA-- THERE’S OTHER REALLY COOL PLACES IN THE SOLAR SYSTEM, INCLUDING IF YOU’RE LOOKING FOR LIFE OUTSIDE OF EARTH. THERE’S OTHER PLACES THAT YOU COULD GO LOOK. MARS IS THE PLANET THAT IS THE MOST LIKELY TO HOST LIFE WHERE HUMANS CAN ACTUALLY GO. LIKE, WE ARE YEARS AND PROBABLY DECADES AND CENTURIES AWAY FROM BEING ABLE TO SAFELY GO TO ENCELADUS OR TITAN OR EUROPA OR WHATEVER WITH PEOPLE. >> THAT’S PRETTY FAR AWAY. >> YEAH, WE HAVE THE TECHNOLOGY TO GET US TO MARS, AND I THINK THAT IT IS-- WE KNOW THAT IN THE MARTIAN PAST MARS WAS A LOT MORE EARTH-LIKE THAN IT IS TODAY. WE DON’T EXACTLY KNOW HOW THAT HAPPENED. IT’S STILL AN OPEN QUESTION AS TO HOW MARS COULD HAVE SUSTAINED THIS WARMER CLIMATE, FOR VARIOUS REASONS THAT WE COULD GET INTO. >> YEAH. >> SO WE DON’T EXACTLY KNOW WHY THAT’S THE CASE, BUT WE KNOW FROM GEOLOGIC EVIDENCE THAT MARS WAS WARMER AND WETTER IN THE PAST THAN IT IS TODAY, AND WE KNOW FROM EARTH THAT PRETTY MUCH AS SOON AS LIFE COULD HAVE EXISTED ON EARTH, IT DID. SO WE DON’T KNOW HOW LIFE ORIGINATES, EXACTLY, BUT AGAIN, FROM EARTH WE SAY, HEY, AS SOON AS THE CONDITIONS WERE RIGHT FOR LIFE TO EXIST, WE FIND EVIDENCE OF LIFE. WE KNOW THAT THOSE SAME CONDITIONS EXISTED ON MARS, SO THE QUESTION IS CAN WE GO TO A PLACE WHERE WE CAN FIND EVIDENCE OF A PAST-- MORE LIKELY PAST BUT POTENTIAL PRESENT LIFE ON MARS. AND THEN AS FAR AS THE ASTRONAUTS, THE ASTRONAUTS WILL ALLOW YOU TO DO A LOT MORE SCIENCE THAN ROBOTS WILL. >> RIGHT, BECAUSE IT-- I MEAN, SO WE TALKED ABOUT THIS ON A PREVIOUS EPISODE WITH BILL FOSTER ABOUT SPACE COMMUNICATION. >> OKAY. >> AND HOW DIFFICULT THAT’S GOING TO BE. IF YOU GET A SIGNAL TO MARS, IT’S GOING TO TAKE 8 MINUTES, UP TO 40 MINUTES ROUND TRIP TO DO ANYTHING. >> YEAH. >> BUT IF A HUMAN WAS THERE, THEY CAN MAKE DECISIONS RAPIDFIRE. >> YEAH. >> YOU CAN GET A LOT MORE DONE IN A SHORTER AMOUNT OF TIME. I’M GUESSING THAT’S LIKE PRETTY MUCH THE BASIS OF WHY HUMANS ARE THAT MUCH BETTER-- PROBABLY ALSO THE OBSERVATIONAL ASPECT OF IT. >> YEAH, ABSOLUTELY, BOTH OF THOSE THINGS TOGETHER. SO LET ME-- I’LL GIVE YOU AN ANECDOTE TO KIND OF SHOW YOU THE LIMITATIONS OF ROBOTIC EXPLORATION. AND FIRST I’LL SAY-- TALK ABOUT THE BENEFITS OF ROBOTIC EXPLORATION. FIRST OF ALL, IT’S SOMETHING THAT WE CAN DO TODAY, RIGHT-- WE’VE BEEN DOING IT ON MARS NOW FOR OVER 40 YEARS. THE VIKING LANDERS LANDED IN LATE 1976. SO WE HAVE A LOT OF EXPERIENCE OPERATING ROBOTS ON THE SURFACE OF MARS, AND THEY ARE VERY CAPABLE. LIKE, THE ROVERS CAN HOLD A LOT MORE STUFF THAN ASTRONAUTS CAN. THEY DON’T HAVE TO CONTINUALLY GO BACK TO THE THE HAB. YOU DON’T HAVE TO SEND FOOD. YOU DON’T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT OXYGEN. >> RIGHT. >> SO IT’S A LOT SIMPLER. HOWEVER, ROBOTS ARE ONLY AS SMART AS THE HUMANS THAT PROGRAM THEM. >> RIGHT. >> AND BECAUSE WE HAVE NO CAPABILITY OF REPAIRING OR FIXING SOMETHING IF IT GOES WRONG, WE’RE VERY CAUTIOUS ABOUT HOW WE OPERATE THE ROVERS, OR ROBOTS. AND AS YOU SAID, WE HAVE THIS COMMUNICATION ISSUE BUILT IN THAT MAKES IT SO THAT-- YOU KNOW, A LOT OF PEOPLE THINK THAT WHEN WE’RE OPERATING THE ROVERS ON MARS, IT’S A MAN OR A WOMAN SITTING IN A ROOM SOMEWHERE WITH A JOYSTICK IN FRONT OF A TV AND DRIVING THE ROVER. >> RIGHT. >> BUT AT ITS CLOSEST, MARS AND EARTH ARE-- THERE’S A FOUR-MINUTE ONE-WAY LIGHT TIME DELAY BETWEEN MARS AND EARTH, SO EIGHT MINUTES ROUND TRIP. AND AT THEIR FARTHEST AWAY, IT’S ABOUT 20 MINUTES ONE-WAY OR 40 MINUTES ROUND TRIP. SO YOU CAN IMAGINE, ANYTHING THAT YOU’RE SEEING IS DELAYED BY 40 MINUTES. SO THERE’S NO WAY-- IN THE WORST CASE-- 8 MINUTES, BEST CASE-- THERE’S NO WAY THAT YOU CAN DO ANY KIND OF REAL TIME OPERATIONS UNDER THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES. SO WHAT WE DO IS WE PLAN A WHOLE DAY AT A TIME. SO DURING THE MARTIAN NIGHT WHEN THE ROVER IS ASLEEP, WE’RE AWAKE PLANNING THE NEXT DAY. AND WHEN THE ROVER WAKES UP, THE FIRST THING IT DOES IS KIND OF CHECK IN WITH EARTH AND GET THE INSTRUCTIONS FOR WHAT IT SHOULD BE DOING THAT DAY. AND THEN IT WILL GO THROUGH THE WHOLE DAY OF PLANNED OPERATIONS, AND THEN GO TO SLEEP, AND THEN THE PROCESS REPEATS-- WAKES UP-- AND SO IT SENDS BACK THE DATA OF WHAT IT DID THAT DAY, WE LOOK AT THE DATA OF WHAT IT DID, HOW THINGS WENT, AND THEN PLAN THE NEXT DAY. SO BECAUSE OF OUR CONSERVATISM, BECAUSE WE DON’T WANT TO BREAK ANYTHING, AND BECAUSE THE ROBOTS ARE ONLY AS SMART AS WE MAKE THEM, YOU’LL HAVE FUNNY INSTANCES WHERE, FOR EXAMPLE, THE PHOENIX LANDER, WHICH WE KNEW HAD A VERY LIMITED LIFETIME BECAUSE IT WAS IN THE NORTHERN POLAR REGION-- SO AT SOME POINT, THE SUN WAS GOING TO SET AND NOT RISE AGAIN FOR SIX MONTHS. SO THERE’S NOTHING THAT WE COULD’VE DONE TO MAKE THAT MISSION LAST FOR YEARS. WE KNEW THAT GOING IN. >> BECAUSE-- HOW COLD DOES IT GET WHEN THE SUN SETS? >> WHEN THE SUN SETS FOR KIND OF MONTHS AT A TIME, I THINK IT CAN GET DOWN TO LIKE MINUS 130, WHICH IS THE FROST POINT FOR CARBON DIOXIDE. >> FAHRENHEIT? >> SO THE MARTIAN ATMOSPHERE-- CELSIUS, SORRY.  BUT AT THAT POINT, THEY’RE RELATIVELY SIMILAR. BUT SO THE MARTIAN ATMOSPHERE IS 95% CARBON DIOXIDE, AND IT GETS SO COLD THAT THE ATMOSPHERE STARTS CONDENSING OUT ONTO THE SURFACE AS DRY ICE. SO OUR LANDER, AT THE END OF THE MARTIAN NORTHERN WINTER, WAS BURIED UNDER A METER OF CARBON DIOXIDE ICE. >> OKAY, SO NO COMING BACK FROM THAT. >> YEAH. SO WE TOOK PICTURES WITH  HIGH RES-- A HIGH RESOLUTION CAMERA AROUND MARS, AND IT LOOKS LIKE ONE OF THE SOLAR PANELS, WHICH IS KIND OF THE SIZE OF A KITCHEN TABLE ON THE LANDER-- IT HAD TWO PANELS ABOUT THAT SIZE, AND THEN A LANDER ITSELF THAT WAS ABOUT THE SAME SIZE. AND IT LOOKS LIKE ONE OF THE SOLAR PANELS WAS BROKEN BY THAT. >> OH. >> SO WE KNEW THAT THERE WAS ALMOST NO CHANCE THAT WE WERE GOING TO SURVIVE TO THE NEXT YEAR. WE KNEW THAT GOING IN. >> BUT THE POLAR ICE CAPS ARE-- THEY’RE SUPER INTERESTING. THAT’S WHY YOU SENT IT THERE, RIGHT? >> SO WE WERE JUST SOUTH OF THE PERMANENT ICE CAPS, BUT-- SO THERE’S THE SEASONAL CAP OF CO2, AND THEN WATER ICE AS WELL. >> COOL. >> BUT THEN THE REASON WHY WE CHOSE THE LOCATION TO SEND PHOENIX IS THAT UNDERNEATH-- OR WE SAW FROM ORBIT THE SIGNATURE OF WATER UNDERNEATH SOIL. AND WE WENT TO CONFIRM THAT, AND WE DID, IN A FEW WAYS. ONE WAS JUST DURING THE LANDING PROCESS. OUR THRUSTERS THAT WE USE TO LAND SAFELY BLEW OFF THE COVERING OF THE SOIL OR LOOSE DIRT RIGHT UNDERNEATH THE THRUSTERS, AND YOU CAN SEE THIS ICE-CEMENTED GROUND. THEN WE HAD A ROBOTIC ARM TO DIG DOWN, AND FOUND THAT DEPENDING ON EXACTLY WHERE WE DUG, BETWEEN 4 AND 15 CENTIMETERS DEEP WE FOUND THIS ICE LAYER WHERE IN A COUPLE PLACES IT LOOKED LIKE IT WAS ALMOST PURE WATER ICE. AND MOST OF THE AREA THAT WE UNCOVERED WAS ICE-CEMENTED SOIL. SO YOU CAN IMAGINE TAKING A DISH FULL OR DIRT, ADDING WATER TO IT, AND THROWING IT IN THE FREEZER. AND AT THESE TEMPERATURES OR AT THE MARTIAN TEMPERATURES THAT I WAS TALKING ABOUT EARLIER, IT’S AS HARD AS CONCRETE. >> REALLY HARD TO DIG, THEN, PROBABLY. >> YEAH, SO WE COULDN’T DIG INTO THAT. THE BEST WE COULD DO, WE COULD KIND OF SCRAPE ALONG THE SURFACE AND COLLECT WHAT WE SCRAPED. BUT WE ALSO HAD A DRILL THAT COULD DRILL ABOUT A CENTIMETER INTO THE ICE, AND THEN WE’D COLLECT THE TAILINGS THAT CAME FROM THE DRILL. >> OKAY. >> BUT TO GET BACK TO THE HUMAN EXPLORATION PLAN, SO ONE DAY ON MARS, WE’RE DIGGING WITH THE PHOENIX LANDER-- AND SO WHAT YOU DO, RIGHT, YOU SAY, “OKAY, DIG HERE, AND THEN DUMP HERE.” SO DIG IN THIS AREA THAT WE DEFINE, AND THEN DUMP OFF IN SOME OTHER AREA. >> ON THE SURFACE, RIGHT? NOT-- >> YEAH, ALL ON THE SURFACE. >> OKAY. >> SO THE ARM IS DIGGING, AND IT GOES TO DUMP, AND IT JUST SO HAPPENED TO CHOOSE A PATH BETWEEN THE DIG LOCATION AND THE DUMP LOCATION THAT THERE WAS A ROCK IN BETWEEN-- IT WASN’T A BIG ROCK. I MEAN, IT WAS MAYBE 8 TO 10 CENTIMETERS ACROSS-- NOT A HUGE ROCK. BUT SO ON LIKE THE VERY FIRST SCOOP-- AND IT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE-- SUPPOSED TO SCOOP FOR A WHILE. ON THE VERY FIRST SCOOP, IT GRABS A SCOOP OF DIRT, HITS THE ROCK, AND JUST STOPS. BECAUSE IT DOESN’T KNOW WHAT TO DO, RIGHT? AND WE DIDN’T PROGRAM IT TO SAY, OKAY, WELL, IF YOU HIT A ROCK, THEN TRY THIS OTHER PATH. >> THE ONLY THING IT KNEW WAS OKAY, YOU GO FROM HERE, AND YOU GO TO HERE. IT WASN’T EXPECTING AN INTERRUPTION. >> YEAH, SO THAT’S THE KIND OF THING-- AND THEN YOU GO IN THE NEXT DAY AND YOU SEE THAT, WOW, THINGS DIDN’T GO AS PLANNED. WE ONLY HAD THIS ONE TINY LITTLE SCOOP. THERE WAS SUPPOSED TO BE A WHOLE TRENCH THERE-- WHAT HAPPENED? AND YOU GO LOOK AT YOUR TELEMETRY AND SAY, “OH, WE HIT A ROCK.” AND IT WASN’T EVEN A VERY BIG ROCK. AND THAT’S THE KIND OF THING WHERE FOR A HUMAN, RIGHT, “OH, I HIT A ROCK. I’LL SLIGHTLY MOVE MY HAND AND GO AROUND THE ROCK.” AND YOU DON’T WASTE AN ENTIRE DAY FROM HITTING A SMALL ROCK. AND WE ENCOUNTER STUFF LIKE THAT ALL THE TIME, BECAUSE AGAIN, THE ROBOT’S ONLY AS SMART AS WE ARE. IF WE ENCOUNTER SOMETHING UNEXPECTED, THE CONSERVATIVE APPROACH IS USUALLY TO SAY, “OKAY, JUST STOP, AND WE’LL TELL YOU WHAT TO DO TOMORROW.” SO A HUMAN DOESN’T HAVE THOSE KIND OF LIMITATIONS. AS YOU’RE SAYING, WE HAVE THE OBSERVATIONAL ABILITY TO FIRST OF ALL ANALYZE THE LANDSCAPE AND SAY, “THOSE LOOK LIKE THE MOST INTERESTING PLACES TO GO INVESTIGATE. LET’S GO THERE.” AND THEN YOU CAN GO DO THINGS VERY QUICKLY. AND SO THE PACE OF EXPLORATION WITH HUMANS CAN BE A LOT FASTER. NOW, THE COST IS ALSO A LOT HIGHER. >> SURE. >> SO YOU’VE GOT TO FIGURE OUT KIND OF WHAT’S YOUR SCIENCE RETURN PER DOLLAR. BUT THE PACE OF EXPLORATIONS WITH HUMANS CAN BE MUCH, MUCH FASTER. >> RIGHT. >> SO LIKE, AS ANOTHER EXAMPLE, THE CURIOSITY ROVER, THE MARS SCIENCE LABORATORY, WHICH HAS BEEN ON MARS NOW FOR ALMOST FIVE YEARS. >> WOW, THAT’S RIGHT. >> WE HAVE DRIVEN JUST OVER 16 KILOMETERS, WHICH IS A LONG WAYS, BUT FOR A HUMAN AND A HUMAN CLASS ROVER, THAT WOULD PROBABLY BE A GOOD DAY OR TWO OF DRIVING. >> RIGHT. >> NOW, YOU KNOW, WE’VE DONE A WHOLE LOT OF SCIENCE ALONG THE WAY, SO YOU CAN’T-- IT’S NOT JUST WE LANDED AND WE’VE BEEN DOING NOTHING BUT DRIVING. >> HIT THE GAS PEDAL AND JUST GO FOR-- >> FOR FIVE YEARS, YEAH. BUT JUST TO GIVE KIND OF A SENSE OF SCALE. I THINK WE-- THE OPPORTUNITY ROVER RELATIVELY RECENTLY SURPASSED HOW FAR THE APOLLO ASTRONAUTS HAD DRIVEN ON THE MOON. >> WOW. >> AND SO I THINK IT TOOK OPPORTUNITY OVER TEN YEARS WHAT THE APOLLO ASTRONAUTS DID IN LIKE THREE DAYS. >> RIGHT. >> SO YOU CAN SEE THAT THERE’S A SENSE OF-- THERE’S THIS DIFFERENCE IN SCALE OF KIND OF WHAT YOU CAN ACCOMPLISH, AND IT’S INTERESTING, THAT YOU’LL FIND THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT HAVE EXPERIENCE WITH ROBOTIC EXPLORATION, ACTUALLY OPERATING THE ROVERS, MANY, MANY, MANY OF US ARE BIG PROPONENTS OF HUMAN EXPLORATION BECAUSE WE UNDERSTAND THE LIMITATIONS, BECAUSE WE KNOW JUST HOW MUCH MORE WE COULD LEARN AND HOW MUCH MORE WE COULD DO WITH HUMANS THERE. >> YEAH. SO I’M GETTING-- SO AS A PLANETARY SCIENTIST-- I GUESS WE SHOULD’VE ADDRESSED THIS A WHILE AGO, BUT YOU-- DO YOU PICK THE LOCATIONS WHERE THE ROVERS ARE GOING TO GO? AND WHICH ROVERS ARE YOU KIND OF WORKING WITH NOW? ARE YOU WORKING WITH CURIOSITY? >> YEAH, SO RIGHT NOW, I’M WORKING WITH CURIOSITY. THE ONLY OTHER ROVER THAT’S CURRENTLY OPERATIONAL IS THE OPPORTUNITY ROVER. >> RIGHT. >> WHICH IS AMAZING. IT’S BEEN GOING FOR MORE THAN 13 YEARS NOW. >> YEAH, WAY PAST ITS EXPECTED-- >> YEAH, THE PRIME MISSION WAS SUPPOSED TO BE 90 DAYS. SO THEY’RE LIKE 4,000% OF LIFETIME OR SOMETHING-- I FORGET THE NUMBER. >> AWESOME. >> BUT MUCH, MUCH, MUCH LONGER THAN THEY EVER EXPECTED, WHICH IS JUST GREAT, AND A TESTAMENT TO THE ENGINEERS THAT BUILT THE ROVER. SO I WORK ON CURIOSITY, AND THE WAY THAT THE LANDING SITE SELECTION PROCESS WORKS IS IT’S ACTUALLY A FAIRLY DEMOCRATIC PROCESS. THEY’LL HAVE MULTIPLE MEETINGS FOR YEARS IN ADVANCE OF LAUNCH FOR SCIENTISTS TO COME, AND YOU CAN PROPOSE TO LAND WHEREVER YOU WANT. YOU CAN SAY-- WELL, OKAY, WITHIN REASON. SO THE ENGINEERS WILL SAY, “OKAY, FOR THIS LANDER IT NEEDS TO BE WITHIN 30 DEGREES OF THE EQUATOR, OR 45 DEGREES OF THE EQUATOR,” OR WHATEVER, AND YOU HAVE TO BE ABLE TO FIT A LANDING ELLIPSE THAT’S THIS SIZE. AND SO THE LANDING ELLIPSE DEFINES-- IS THE AREA IN WHICH YOU ARE CONFIDENT YOUR LANDER IS GOING TO LAND. SO, SAY, FOR THE MER ROVERS, THE LANDING ELLIPSE WAS LIKE 100 KILOMETERS LONG AND -- I DON’T REMEMBER-- 15 KILOMETERS WIDE OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT. SO YOU’D HAVE TO SAY, “ALL RIGHT, YOU HAVE TO FIND A PLACE WHERE WE CAN SAFELY LAND ANYWHERE INSIDE OF A 100 KILOMETER LONG ELLIPSE BY 20 KILOMETERS WIDE. AND MSL, BECAUSE WE GOT BETTER AT GUIDANCE DURING ENTRY, THE LANDING ELLIPSE WAS ONLY LIKE 12 KILOMETERS LONG I THINK AND A FEW KILOMETERS WIDE. SO A FACTOR OF 10 IMPROVEMENT OVER WHAT WE’D DONE BEFORE, WHICH OPENED UP A WHOLE HOST OF OTHER LANDING SITES. >> BECAUSE NOW YOU DON’T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT THINGS BEING IN THE WAY. >> YEAH, YOU DON’T HAVE TO-- >> A HUNDRED KILOMETERS KIND OF ELLIPSE. >> YOU CAN PICK A LOT MORE INTERESTING PLACES BECAUSE YOU’RE SAFETY REQUIREMENTS ARE RELAXED FROM JUST KIND OF THE PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY STANDPOINT. >> MM-HMM. >> BUT SO GIVEN THOSE RESTRICTIONS, YOU CAN PROPOSE ANYWHERE YOU WANT. >> MM-HMM. >> AND YOU CAN-- SO YOU’LL GO AND YOU ADVOCATE, YOU MAKE YOUR PRESENTATION, AND YOU ADVOCATE FOR THIS PARTICULAR SITE, AND WHY YOUR SITE IS BETTER THAN ANY OF THE OTHER ONES, THE QUESTIONS THAT WE’RE GOING TO ADDRESS BY LANDING THERE, WHY THIS SITE BEST MEETS NASA’S GOALS AND THE GOALS OF THE PLANETARY SCIENCE COMMUNITY. AND SO, I MEAN, I THINK THEY START OUT WITH A LIST OF LIKE 30 TO 50 LANDING SITES, OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT. AND OVER TIME IT’LL GET NARROWED DOWN TO USUALLY AROUND 3 OR 4. AND THEN WHAT HAPPENS IS THERE WILL KIND OF BE LIKE A COMMUNITY CONSENSUS AROUND, “THIS IS OUR TOP PICK.” SO THAT’S KIND OF THE DEMOCRATIC SIDE OF THINGS, BUT THEN ULTIMATELY THE DECISION IS MADE-- I’M NOT EXACTLY SURE WHO, BUT PROGRAM OFFICER LEVEL, NASA HEADQUARTER LEVEL, WHERE THEY’LL SAY-- BECAUSE SOMETIMES A SCIENTIST WILL PICK THINGS THAT ARE LIKE, “THIS IS REALLY INTERESTING, BUT IT’S A LITTLE BIT RISKIER THAN SOME OTHER SITE.” AND FOR THE SCIENTISTS WE SAY, “YEAH, WE WANT TO DO IT.” AND NASA HEADQUARTERS MIGHT COME IN AND SAY, “GUYS, IT’S A LOT MORE IMPORTANT FOR US TO LAND SAFELY THEN TO ANSWER THIS PARTICULAR QUESTION.” >> RIGHT. >> “SO WE’RE GOING TO CHOOSE THIS SITE.” >> OKAY. >> BUT FOR THE MOST PART, IT’S VERY DEMOCRATIC ABOUT BASICALLY ANYBODY WITH A GOOD IDEA CAN SUBMIT A CANDIDATE LANDING SITE, AND THEN IT GETS TALKED ABOUT IN THE COMMUNITY FOR YEARS. YOU ANALYZE IT FOR SAFETY. WE ACTUALLY USE OUR ORBITAL ASSETS THAT ARE AROUND MARS NOW TO TAKE A LOT OF PICTURES OF IT TO MAKE SURE FOR SAFETY REASONS THAT IT’S SAFE. LIKE, ANOTHER LITTLE ANECDOTE WITH PHOENIX WE HAD ONE-- WE HAD FOUR CANDIDATE LANDING SITES AND THE TOP, I’M ALMOST POSITIVE IF I’M REMEMBERING CORRECTLY, THE TOP-- WE HAD DECIDED ON ONE LANDING SITE OF, “OKAY, WE THINK THIS ONE’S GOING TO BE THE BEST.” AND THEN WE HAD THE HiRISE CAMERA GET TO MARS KIND OF RIGHT AT THE TAIL END OF THIS PROCESS. SO WE DIDN’T HAVE THE HIGH ENOUGH RESOLUTION-- WE DIDN’T HAVE AS HIGH A RESOLUTION PICTURES AS WE DO TODAY. SO HiRISE, ONE OF ITS TOP PRIORITIES WAS EVALUATING THESE PHOENIX-- POTENTIAL PHOENIX LANDING SITES. AND THIS ONE THAT WE HAD DECIDED WAS GOING TO BE OUR TOP SITE, THE PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR OF THE HiRISE IMAGE-- INSTRUMENT, WHICH IS ALSO BUILT AT THE UNIVERSITY OF ARIZONA, WHERE THE PHOENIX LANDER WAS. THE PIF HiRISE WAS A GOOD FRIEND WITH THE PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR OF PHOENIX AND HE SENT AN EMAIL WITH THE PICTURE OF THIS LANDING SITE AND IT WAS FILLED WITH MASSIVE BOULDERS. THERE WERE JUST BELOW THE LIMIT OF RESOLUTION OF THIS OTHER CAMERA AND IT WOULD’VE BEEN AN AWFUL, AWFUL PLACE TO LAND. SO AT THAT POINT, LIKE OKAY, ALL OF THE OTHER ARGUMENTS ARE THROWN OUT BECAUSE IT’S NOT SAFE. >> OH, YEAH. >> AND SO WE WENT TO I THINK PLAN B AND THEY IMAGED THAT ONE AND IT WAS LIKE, “YEAH, THAT ONE. THAT ONE LOOKS GOOD.” >> WOW. OKAY, THAT WOULD’VE BEEN-- YEAH. THAT WOULD’VE BEEN NOT GOOD. >>I MEAN, I THINK AS I RECALL, WE GOT THE IMAGE AROUND HALLOWEEN, SO HE SENT IT WITH THE CAPTION OF LIKE, “HAPPY HALLOWEEN.” AND THE WHOLE THING WAS LIKE SHADED RED OR ORANGE OR SOMETHING TO MAKE IT LOOK EVEN SCARIER THAN IT ACTUALLY WAS. >> WOW. >>  SO YEAH, AT THAT POINT WE KNEW, “OKAY, THAT’S NOT-- WE’RE NOT GOING TO LAND THERE. LET’S GO SOMEWHERE ELSE.” >> WOW. >> SO, I MEAN, THERE’S ROVERS ALL OVER THE PLACE, RIGHT? IT’S JUST YOU SAID WE’VE BEEN LANDING ON MARS SINCE THE LATE ‘70s, SINCE ‘76 I THINK YOU SAID WAS THE VIKING, RIGHT? >> YEAH. >> SO THERE’S A LOT OF INTERESTING THINGS ABOUT MARS. SO, I MEAN, MAIN QUESTION, RIGHT, SO IF YOU’RE LOOKING AT MARS AND YOU WANT TO KNOW, “OKAY, WHAT IS THIS PLANET? WHY IS IT SO INTERESTING?” >> UH-HUH. >> MAIN QUESTION: WHY IS IT THAT RED OR BURNT ORANGEY COLOR? >> YEAH. >> LIKE, WHAT IS THE OFFICIAL COLOR OF MARS? >> WELL, RED. >> RED. >> I MEAN, THAT’S ONE OF MARS’ NICKNAMES IS THE RED PLANET. >> RIGHT, OKAY. >> I MEAN, THAT’S WHEN I’M WRITING STUFF ABOUT MARS I WILL FREQUENTLY CALL IT THE RED PLANET JUST TO AVOID REPEATING MARS OR MARTIAN OVER AND OVER AGAIN. >> YEAH. >> SO MARS GETS ITS RED COLOR REALLY FROM ESSENTIALLY RUST. >> OH. >> SO YOU HAVE-- IN SOME PARTS THOUGH-- OR MANY PLACES ON MARS, IT’S INTERESTING, BUT IT’S REALLY ONLY SKIN DEEP THAT YOU CAN UNCOVER-- OR IF WE GO AND EITHER BRUSH OFF OR JUST BLOW AWAY SOME OF THE DUST YOU GET TO-- UNDERNEATH IT IT LOOKS A LOT DARKER. BUT WE HAVE THIS BRIGHT DUST DEPOSITS KIND OF ALL OVER NO MARS BECAUSE MARS CAN HAVE THESE GLOBAL DUST STORMS. SO YOU GET THIS STUFF DISTRIBUTED EVERYWHERE. >> WOW. >> AND THE RED COLOR REALLY COMES FROM THE OXIDIZED IRON, WHICH AGAIN, RUST, OR HEMATITE, THE SPECIFIC MINERAL OR OTHER THINGS LIKE THAT THAT GIVE MARS ITS RED COLOR. SO YOU HAD OXYGEN IN THE ATMOSPHERE, WHICH IS REACTING WITH MINERALS ON THE SURFACE TO PRODUCE THIS IRON OXIDE, WHICH GIVES MARS ITS RED COLOR. >> HUH. IS IT SHARP, THE DIRT? OR DO YOU CALL IT DIRT OR DO YOU CALL IT-- >> YEAH, SOIL OR-- WE’RE MOVING TOWARDS CALLING IT SOIL ON MARS. >> SOIL. >> EVEN THOUGH SOME TERRESTRIAL PEOPLE SAY, “UH, SOILS HAVE TO HAVE LIVING THINGS IN IT.” >> OKAY. >> BUT WE LIKE REGOLITH ON THE-- OR THE WHAT WE’RE CALLING SOIL ON MARS IS DIFFERENT FROM REGOLITH ON THE MOON OR OTHER AIRLESS BODIES. >> YEAH, OKAY. NICE. BUT THERE’S OXYGEN IN THE ATMOSPHERE. NOT A LOT THOUGH, RIGHT? LIKE YOU CAN’T STEP OUT ON MARS OUT OF YOUR-- IF YOU WERE TO LAND ON MARS AND STEP OUT OF YOUR CAPSULE AND BREATH THE FRESH AIR, RIGHT? THERE’S NOT A LOT. >> CORRECT. THERE IS-- SO MARS’ ATMOSPHERE IS 95% CARBON DIOXIDE, 2% NITROGEN, AND 2% ARGON, WITH-- SO THAT ONLY ADDS UP TO 99%. SO THEN THERE’S OTHER LITTLE BITS AND OXYGEN IS ONE OF THE OTHER LITTLE BITS, BUT IT’S MUCH, MUCH LESS THAN 1% OXYGEN. >> BUT IT’S ENOUGH TO RUST THE-- >> YEAH. >> MAKE THE SOIL-- >> WELL, AND THAT’S THE IDEA OF-- THAT’S WHERE AT SOME POINT IN THE PAST MARS’ ATMOSPHERE PROBABLY HAD MORE OXYGEN. >> RIGHT. >> AN DTHAT OXYGEN REACTED WITH WHAT’S ON THE SURFACE. >> OKAY, SO COMPARED TO EARTH, OUR EARTH IS MOSTLY LIKE NITROGEN, RIGHT, 70% NITROGEN AND THEN-- >> YEAH, 80%-- ROUGHLY 80% NITROGEN, 20% OXYGEN INSIDE OF THE-- >> OKAY, OKAY. SO ONLY 20%, THAT’S AWESOME. >> BUT SO THE OTHER THING THOUGH IS THERE’S-- YOU CAN’T-- NOT ENOUGH OXYGEN TO BREATH, BUT IT’S ALSO LESS THAN 1% OF THE ATMOSPHERIC PRESSURE OF THE EARTH. SO REALLY LOW PRESSURE, NO OXYGEN. THERE’S A LOT OF DIFFERENT WAYS THAT YOU COULD MEET A QUICK END ON MARS IF YOU JUST DECIDED TO STEP OUTSIDE WITHOUT ANY KIND OF PROTECTION. >> WHICH GOES TO OUR EARLIER POINT IS IF YOU WERE TO GO THERE YOU WOULD PROBABLY NEED A HABITAT, AND YOU WOULD NEED ROVERS, AND YOU NEED ALL KINDS OF SPACESUITS TO WALK AROUND. >> YUP. > YOU’D NEED ALL KINDS OF THINGS TO SURVIVE ON MARS, BUT-- I MEAN, MARS IS NOT JUST-- IT’S NOT JUST A BLANKET OF THE SOIL, THIS RED SOIL. IT’S GOT HILLS AND MOUNTAINS. IT’S GOT ONE OF THE BIGGEST-- >> IT HAS THE BIGGEST VOLCANO IN THE SOLAR SYSTEM. >> THE BIGGEST VOLCANO IN THE SOLAR SYSTEM, RIGHT? SO, I MEAN, THERE HAS TO-- THERE WAS A PAST OF GEOLOGICAL ACTIVITY, RIGHT? >> YES. YEAH, ABSOLUTELY. SO WHEN WE LOOK AT THE HISTORY OF MARS, WE SEE A LOT OF EVIDENCE EARLY ON, LIKE I WAS SAYING EARLIER, THAT MARS WAS WARMER AND WETTER THAN IT IS TODAY. NOW, IT’S STILL AN OPEN DEBATE ABOUT HOW WARM IT IS AND HOW WET IT WAS, BUT WE KNOW THAT IT’S WARMER AND WETTER BECAUSE WE SEE EVIDENCE FOR RIVERS AND LAKES. >> MM-HMM. >> SO THERE WAS LIKELY AT THE VERY LEAST SNOW, POSSIBLY RAIN, BUT-- AND THESE-- I MEAN, THESE AREN’T LIKE LITTLE STREAMS. LARGE CHANNELS, HUGE LAKES. IT’S POSSIBLE THAT THERE WAS A MASSIVE OCEAN. SO WE KNOW THAT MARS WAS WARMER AND WETTER IN THE PAST, AND THEN KIND OF AFTER THAT MARS DRIES OUT, AND THEN YOU HAVE ALL THIS ABUNDANT EVIDENCE OF WHAT YOU’RE TALKING ABOUT, THE VOLCANIC ACTIVITY. REALLY, I MEAN, ALL OVER THE PLACE ON THE SURFACE IF THE PLANET THAT HAS REALLY KIND OF RESURFACED A LOT OF MARS. WE SEE-- WE STILL SEE A LOT OF CRATERS, BUT THERE’S VOLCANIC ACTIVITY ALL OVER THE PLACE, LIKE YOU SAID. SO WE HAVE OLYMPUS MONS, THAT’S LIKE 20 KILOMETERS HIGH, THE BIGGEST VOLCANO IN THE SOLAR SYSTEM. >> SUPER BIG. >> SO MSL, OR THE CURIOSITY ROVER, LANDED AT THE BOTTOM OF THE GALE CRATER, WHICH IS 150 KILOMETER WIDE CRATER THAT’S 5 KILOMETERS DEEP. AND RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE CRATER IS A 5 KILOMETER HIGH MOUNTAIN. SO THAT’S-- I MEAN, THIS IS-- IT IS A MOUNTAIN. IT’S NOT A HILL. >> YEAH. >> IT IS HUGE. >> WOW. >> I MEAN, THIS IS-- IT’S LIKE RIVALS MOUNT RAINIER OR MOUNT SHASTA OR SOMETHING. LIKE, IT IS BIG. >> OKAY, YEAH. >> IT’S REALLY BIG. IT WOULD BE ONE OF THE LARGEST MOUNTAINS IN KIND OF THE LOWER 48 UNITED STATES. >> WOW. >> AND IT’S-- WE’RE STILL KIND OF TRYING TO FIGURE OUT EXACTLY HOW IT WAS FORMED. ONE OF THE INTERESTING THINGS ABOUT IT IS THAT IT WAS-- IT WAS NOT FORMED BY-- SO, MOST MOUNTAINS ON THE EARTH ARE FORMED THROUGH PLATE TECTONICS, RIGHT? THE CONTINENTAL PLATES KIND OF CRASHING AGAINST EACH OTHER. OR A SUBDUCTION OF AN OCEANIC PLATE PUSHING UP MOUNTAINS AND THAT'S HOW WE GET MOUNTAINS ON THE EARTH. ON MARS, WE DON’T REALLY HAVE PLATE TECTONICS, SO YOU CAN FORM MOUNTAINS EITHER FROM VOLCANOES. THERE MIGHT BE SOME TECTONIC ACTIVITY, BUT WHAT WE’RE SEEING IN MOUNT SHARP IS LIKELY THE RESULT OF ACTUALLY THE CRATER, TO SOME DEGREE, FILLING UP WITH SEDIMENT, SO DIRT, ROCK, WHATEVER, AROUND A PRE-EXISTING CENTRAL PEAK IN THE CRATER THAT WE STILL SEE SOME EVIDENCE FOR. BUT WHAT THE MOUNTAIN THAT WE SEE IS MUCH, MUCH LARGER THAN THE CENTRAL PEAK WOULD’VE BEEN. AND THEN, ERODING AWAY INTO THE SHAPE THAT WE SEE TODAY. SO COMPLETELY DIFFERENT FORM OF-- OR COMPLETELY DIFFERENT FORMATION MECHANISM FOR A MOUNTAIN. I DON’T-- I CAN’T THINK OF EXAMPLE OR ANY PLACE ON THE EARTH WHERE YOU WOULD EVER SEE ANYTHING LIKE THIS. >> WOW. >> BUT STILL, WE FORMED THIS 5 KILOMETER HIGH MOUNTAIN, AND THE COOL THING ABOUT IT THOUGH IS BECAUSE IT IS THIS COMPOSED OF SEDIMENTARY LAYERS THAT WERE LAID DOWN OVER HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF YEARS, AS WE DRIVE UP THE MOUNTAIN WE ARE SEEING DIFFERENT-- WE ARE SEEING DIFFERENT LAYERS AND WE GET A WINDOW INTO MARS’ GEOLOGIC PAST. SO WE COULD LEARN SOMETHING ABOUT WHAT WAS MARS’ ENVIRONMENT LIKE 3.5 BILLION YEARS AGO. AND THE REASON THAT WE PICKED THIS LOCATION IS THAT THE LOWER PART OF THE MOUNTAIN WAS CREATED WHEN MARS WAS WARMER AND WETTER AND THE UPPER PART WAS CREATED WHEN MARS WAS COLDER AND DRYER. SO WE’RE GOING TO HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO DRIVE ACROSS THESE MATERIALS WHERE THAT SPANNED AGAIN HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF YEARS OF GEOLOGIC TIME. >> YOU’RE KIND OF LIKE DRIVING THROUGH TIME, YEAH. >> WHERE MARS WENT UNDER THIS-- YEAH. WHEN MARS UNDERWENT THIS FUNDAMENTAL GEOLOGIC CHANGE-- OR CLIMATE CHANGE. SO TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT HAPPENED. >> IT’S KIND OF LIKE-- SO I MEAN, I’M FROM PENNSYLVANIA, SO I REMEMBER DRIVING DOWN THE HIGHWAY AND SEEING THEY BLEW UP SOME OF THE ROCKS AND THEN YOU COULD SEE THE LAYERS OF THE ROCKS. >> YEAH. OH, YEAH, ROCK CUTS ARE GEOLOGISTS BEST FRIEND. >> YEAH. >> SO IT’S KIND OF LIKE, I MEAN, THE MOUNTAIN ITSELF ARE THOSE LAYERS OF ROCK AS YOU DRIVE UP. >> UH-HUH. >> IS-- I GUESS THAT WOULD BE A KIND OF A GOOD COMPARISON? >> YEAH, YEAH. IT’S JUST ON MARS IT MIGHT ACTUALLY BE A LITTLE BIT EASIER TO INTERPRET SOME OF IT BECAUSE OF THE EARTH-- AGAIN, THE MOUNTAIN, YOU HAD THE LAYERS-- SO YOU HAD THE LAYERS KIND OF LAID DOWN CREATING THE ROCK AND THEN YOU’LL HAVE THESE OTHER TECTONIC EVENTS THAT PUSH THEM UP. AND IN THE PROCESS, THINGS GET ALL KINDS OF JUMBLED. BUT ON MARS, THERE WAS NO TECTONISM SO THEY LAID-- THE ROCKS GOT LAID DOWN AND THEN THEY GET ERODED AWAY. BUT THERE’S NOTHING THAT HAS-- THAT WAS PUSHED UP FROM KILOMETERS DEEPER, OR YOU KNOW, OVERTURNED, CREATING ALL KINDS OF CONFUSION. SO IT’S-- IF WE CAN GET THERE TO THE RIGHT PLACES-- UNFORTUNATELY, ON MARS THERE IS NO ROAD CUTS SO WE HAVE TO DO WITH-- WE HAVE TO USE WHAT WE’RE GIVEN, BUT IT’S VERY SIMILAR TO WHAT YOU’D SEE IN A LOT OF PLACES ON THE EARTH. >> WOW. OKAY, SO ANOTHER MAIN DIFFERENCE, RIGHT, IS I GUESS, THE ATMOSPHERE. WE JUST HAD A RECENT DISCOVERY ABOUT HOW MARS’ ATMOSPHERE HAS CHANGED OVER TIME, RIGHT? >> UH-HUH. >> AND HOW-- WHAT’S THE RADIATION ENVIRONMENT LIKE ON THE SURFACE? >> SO YEAH, THE ATMOSPHERE-- SO THAT’S TWO THINGS. >> OKAY, OKAY. >> THE ATMOSPHERE, AGAIN, WE KNOW THAT IT WAS WARMER AND WETTER IN THE PAST SO THAT WE KNOW THAT THE ATMOSPHERE HAD TO BE A LOT THICKER THAN IT IS TODAY TO HOLD IN THAT HEAT. AND WE’RE, AGAIN, THOUGH WE’RE STILL UNCLEAR HOW MARS WAS ABLE TO BE AS WARM AND WET AS IT WAS. THERE IS SOMETHING-- SOME KIND OF MAGIC COMBINATION OF PRESSURE AND CHEMICAL ELEMENTS IN THE ATMOSPHERE THAT HAD TO OF EXISTED TO ALLOW MARS TO BE WARMER AND WETTER. AND THAT’S STILL SOMETHING THAT PEOPLE ARE DEBATING TODAY. SO HOW THAT RELATES TO RADIATION IS THAT ON THE EARTH THERE’S A FEW THINGS THAT PROTECT US FROM THE RADIATION ENVIRONMENT IN SPACE. ONE IS EARTH HAS A MAGNETIC FIELD THAT DOES A LOT OF THE WORK. THE OTHER THING IS WE HAVE A RELATIVELY THICK ATMOSPHERE, SO ANYTHING THAT MAKES IT THROUGH THE MAGNETIC FIELD IS GENERALLY GOING TO GET STOPPED IN THE ATMOSPHERE. SO MARS DOESN’T HAVE EITHER OF THOSE THINGS. AND THERE’S OTHER TYPES OF RADIATION AS WELL, SO LIKE ULTRAVIOLET RADIATION, WHICH IS NOT GREAT FOR PEOPLE. EARTH HAS AN OZONE LAYER. MARS, DEPENDING ON THE SEASON, WILL HAVE A TINY BIT OF OZONE IN THE ATMOSPHERE, BUT NOT REALLY ENOUGH TO EFFECTIVELY SHIELD YOU FROM UV. SO YOU GET ULTRAVIOLET LIGHT DOWN TO THE SURFACE-- DOWN TO THE SURFACE OF MARS, WHICH ON THE EARTH WOULD BE STERILIZING. LIKE, IF YOU’RE--YOU STICK A BUG-- THAT’S ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE DO ON EARTH TO STERILIZE WATER OR WHATEVER, YOU SHINE IT WITH UV LIGHT THAT MARS IS GETTING BATHED IN ALL THE TIME. >> OH. >> SO THE VERY SURFACE OF MARS IS NOT TERRIBLY HOSPITABLE TO LIFE. BUT THE GOOD NEWS IS, THE IRON OXIDES, FOR EXAMPLE, ARE VERY GOOD SUNSCREEN. SO IF YOU’RE UNDER A COUPLE OF MICRONS, SO LIKE A HUMAN HAIR’S WIDTH OF IRON OXIDE WILL DO A PRETTY GOOD JOB PROTECTING YOU FROM ULTRAVIOLET LIGHT. SO THAT’S ONE TYPE OF RADIATION. THE OTHER TYPE IS, AGAIN, THE KIND OF-- THE SPACE RADIATION ENVIRONMENT WHERE YOU HAVE THESE HIGH ENERGY GALACTIC COSMIC RAYS AND STUFF THE SUN’S SHOOTING AT YOU ALL THE TIME. >> OH, YEAH. >> SO THIS IS SOMETHING THAT YOU HAVE TO BE-- FOR ROBOTS, IT’S SOMETHING THAT WE HAVE TO BE AWARE OF AS WELL, BECAUSE WE ACTUALLY HAVE TO USE SPECIAL ELECTRONICS THAT ARE, LIKE, RADIATION HARDENED. FOR PEOPLE, YOU HAVE A COUPLE THINGS YOU NEED TO DO. ONE IS, YOU HAVE TO HAVE SOME KIND OF-- SOME KIND OF SHIELDING, AND THEN THE OTHER IS JUST KIND OF WHAT YOUR MISSION ARCHITECTURE IS. YOU WANT TO SPEND AS LITTLE TIME IN SPACE AS POSSIBLE. >> RIGHT. >> BUT I MEAN, WHAT I THINK, THERE’S A FEW THINGS THAT YOU CAN DO TO SHIELD YOU FROM RADIATION. LIKE RECENTLY-- WE HAVE A RADIATION DETECTOR ON CURIOSITY ON MARS. RELATIVELY RECENTLY WE WERE RIGHT UP NEXT TO A HILL DOING SOME SCIENCE AND THE COUNTS IN THE RADIATION DETECTOR WENT WAY DOWN. BECAUSE THIS RADIATION, IT’S NOT JUST COMING FROM THE SUN. IT’S COMING FROM EVERYWHERE IN THE SKY, BASICALLY UNIFORMLY. >> HUH. >> SO IF YOU CAN BLOCK OUT ANY PART OF THE SKY YOU’RE GOING TO LOWER YOUR RADIATION DOSAGE. SO IF YOU’RE AN ASTRONAUT YOU PROBABLY WANT TO BUILD YOUR HABITAT UP CLOSE TO A LITTLE HILL OR A MOUNTAIN AND MAYBE ONE OF THE FIRST THINGS THAT YOU DO WHEN YOU GET THERE OR YOU HAD ROBOTS DO THIS BEFORE YOU GOT THERE IS START FILLING UP SANDBAGS AND PUT IT ON THE ROOF ON YOUR HABITAT. BECAUSE YOU JUST NEED MORE MASS. THAT’S WHAT THE ATMOSPHERE IS. ON EARTH, IT’S JUST MORE MASS IN BETWEEN THE RADIATION ENVIRONMENT AND THE GROUND. SO YOU JUST NEED MORE MASS ON TOP OF YOU TO SHIELD YOU FROM THIS RADIATION. AND THEN, AGAIN, LIKE THE UV STUFF-- AN ASTRONAUT IN A SPACESUIT WILL BE JUST FINE. >> I’M IMAGINING LIKE IN “STAR WARS,” LIKE LUKE SKYWALKER’S HOUSE. HOW THEY JUST HAD THE BIG DOME MADE OF THE-- >> LITTLE DOME ON TATOOINE. >> YEAH, ON TATOOINE, MADE OF THE-- IT LOOKED LIKE SAND. >> YEAH. >> SO JUST LIKE MAKING LIKE A SAND DOME. >> YEAH, SO YOU NEED SOMETHING LIKE THAT, BECAUSE AGAIN, LIKE WHEN WE WENT TO THE MOON, THE LUNAR LANDER WAS-- I FORGET, BUT AS I RECALL, LIKE PAPER THIN, RIGHT. LIKE, IT WASN’T A LONG DURATION-- THEY WEREN’T PLANNING ON STAYING THERE FOR A LONG TIME. >> RIGHT. >> SO ON MARS, IF YOU’RE GOING TO STAY THERE FOR LIKE A YEAR AND A HALF, WHICH IS GENERALLY THE MISSION ARCHITECTURE SAYS ABOUT 6 MONTHS TRIP TO MARS TO GET TO MARS, A YEAR AND A HALF ON THE SURFACE, 6 MONTHS BACK. SO IF YOU’RE GOING TO SPEND A YEAR AND A HALF ON THE SURFACE OF MARS YOU NEED TO DO SOMETHING TO SHIELD YOURSELF FROM RADIATION ONCE YOU GET THERE. >> DEFINITELY. SO IN THE MOVIE “THE MARTIAN” THERE WAS A SEVERE DUST STORM. >> YES. >> FROM WHAT I UNDERSTAND, THAT WOULDN’T REALLY HAPPEN, RIGHT? >> CORRECT. >> YEAH. >> AND THIS IS-- SO I GOT TO SAY THOUGH, BECAUSE NOT A KNOCK AGAINST ANDY WEIR AT ALL. >> YEAH. >> BECAUSE WHEN HE WAS AT JSC A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO, HE GAVE A PRESENTATION AND SAID, “OKAY, BEFORE YOU GUYS ASK ANY QUESTIONS, I KNOW THAT THE DUST STORM WASN’T REALISTIC.” >> HE WAS PROBABLY VERY NERVOUS ABOUT HIS AUDIENCE. >> YEAH. >> HE’S LIKE, “THESE ARE THE GUYS THAT KNOW!” OH, NO. YEAH. >> YEAH, SO HE JUST SAID, “I WANTED TO WRITE A BOOK ABOUT KIND OF LIKE “ROBINSON CRUSOE” ON MARS AND I HAD TO DO SOMETHING TO GET HIM STRANDED THERE.” >> RIGHT. >> SO THE DUST STORM IS NOT REALISTIC BECAUSE MARS’ ATMOSPHERIC PRESSURE, AGAIN, IS LESS THAN 1% OF THE EARTH-- EARTH’S ATMOSPHERIC PRESSURE. SO EVEN WHEN YOU HAVE VERY FAST WINDS THEY’RE NOT VERY STRONG. SO YOU COULD HAVE LIKE 100 MILE AND HOUR GUST AND IT’LL FEEL LIKE LESS-- A LESS THAN 10 MILE AN HOUR WIND ON THE SURFACE OF THE EARTH. SO IT’S JUST NOT STRONG ENOUGH TO PUSH ANYTHING OVER THAT SIZE. THE OTHER DIFFERENCE IS THEY’RE ARE DUST STORMS ON MARS AND THEY CAN BE PLANET ENCIRCLING, WHICH IS-- >> RIGHT, YEAH. YOU MENTIONED THAT BEFORE. >> YEAH, IT’S-- WHICH IS REALLY INTERESTING. SOMETHING THAT OBVIOUSLY DOESN’T HAPPEN ON THE EARTH. >> RIGHT. >> THANKFULLY. >> YEAH. >> THE WAY THAT IT WORKS, AND YOU CAN GO LOOK AT-- THERE’S PICTURES OF THIS BECAUSE THE OPPORTUNITY ROVER HAS BEEN THERE DURING-- I DON’T THINK IT WAS A PLANET ENCIRCLING ONE, BUT AT LEAST A VERY REGION, LIKE LARGE SCALE DUST STORM. >> MM-HMM. >> AND THE WAY THAT IT LOOKS IS AT THE BEGINNING OF THE DUST STORM YOU HAVE-- OR BEFORE THE DUST STORM STARTS YOU HAVE PRETTY CLEAR SKIES, AND THEN SOMETHING LIKE 20 TO 30 DAYS LATER YOU CAN’T EVEN SEE THE SUN AT ALL ANYMORE. IT JUST MAYBE GETS SLIGHTLY LIGHTER-- OR BRIGHTER DURING THE DAY. BUT IT’S A VERY GRADUAL INCREASE FROM DAY TO DAY. IT’S NOT LIKE IN “THE MARTIAN” THE “AH! HERE’S THIS MASSIVE DUST STORM BARRELING DOWN ON US. LET’S GET-- LET’S ALL GO INSIDE.” >> “IT’S TIPPING THE MAV!” YEAH, IT WAS LIKE-- >> YEAH, SO THAT WAS-- SO MARS DOES HAVE THESE REALLY LARGE DUST STORMS. >> RIGHT. >> BUT THEY’RE JUST NOT STRONG ENOUGH TO REALLY HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT MUCH. >> DOES IT HAVE IT’S OWN WEATHER, TOO? IT HAS LIKE LIGHTNING AND STUFF, RIGHT? >> YOU KNOW, I DON’T KNOW ABOUT LIGHTNING. IT MIGHT, I THINK. I DO KNOW OF PEOPLE WHO HAVE SAID THAT IT PROBABLY DOES HAVE LIGHTNING AND THE LIGHTNING COULD CREATE INTERESTING CHEMICALS THAT WE SEE IN THE ATMOSPHERE AND ON THE SURFACE, AND SO MAYBE THAT’S A SIGNATURE OF LIGHTNING. I DON’T KNOW THAT WE’VE EVER DIRECTLY OBSERVED LIGHTNING. >> MM-HMM. >> BUT MARS ABSOLUTELY HAS WEATHER. IT IS STILL A VERY DYNAMIC PLACE. THE MAIN AGENT OF CHANGE ON MARS IS WIND. IT JUST HAPPENS AT A SLOWER PACE THAN ON THE EARTH, BUT WE HAVE-- MARS HAS SAND DUNES THAT MARCH ACROSS THE SURFACE. IT HAS THIS DUST THAT CAN BLOW ALL OVER THE PLACE. MARS HAS DUST DEVIL, SO IF YOU LIVE IN A LITTLE BIT DRIER, MORE ARID ENVIRONMENT AND YOU SEE A-- AND YOU KNOW WHAT A DUST DEVIL IS, WE HAVE-- WE SEE DUST DEVILS ON MARS ALL THE TIME. >> AND THOSE THE TORNADO-- SAND TORNADOES? >> YEAH, THEY LOOK KIND OF LIKE LITTLE TORNADOES. YEAH. >> YEAH, YEAH, YEAH. >> GOOD-- YEAH. SAND TORNADO IS A GOOD DESCRIPTION. AND WE’VE ACTUALLY BEEN LUCKY WITH SOME OF THOSE. SO SPIRIT AND OPPORTUNITY-- I KNOW THIS HAPPENED WITH OPPORTUNITY. I’M PRETTY SURE IT HAPPENED WITH BOTH OF THEM. SO THEY’RE SOLAR POWERED ROVERS SO THEY SAW THE OUTPUT FROM THEIR SOLAR PANELS WAS DECREASING OVER TIME BECAUSE YOU’RE CONSTANTLY GETTING DUST SETTLING OUT OF THE ATMOSPHERE. AND THEN, SO THE-- I CAN’T REMEMBER THE EXACT NUMBERS, BUT IT HAD GONE DOWN TO LIKE HALF OF THE SOLAR PANEL OUTPUT FROM WHEN IT LANDED. AND THEN THEY LOOKED AT THE DATA AND FROM ONE DAY TO THE NEXT IT JUMPS BACK UP TO THE SAME AMOUNT OF POWER THEY WERE GETTING ON LIKE DAY 1 OF LANDING. AND SO THEY LOOK AT THEIR SOLAR PANELS AND THEY’D BEEN COMPLETELY CLEANED. >> OH. >> SO WHAT THEY THINK HAPPENED IS A DUST DEVIL PASSED DIRECTLY OVER THE ROVER AND DID US HUGE FAVOR BY CLEANING OFF THE SOLAR PANEL. IT’S LIKE THERE’S NO WAY THAT OPPORTUNITY WOULD STILL BE ALIVE HAD THAT NOT HAPPENED MULTIPLE TIMES. >> WOW. OKAY, SO THEY’RE PRETTY FREQUENT THEN IF THEY’RE-- >> YEAH. OH, YEAH. THIS HAPPENS ALL THE TIME. >> WOW. >> AND LIKE I-- YOU CAN ACTUALLY SEE THE DUST DEVIL TRACKS FROM SPACE. A FRIEND OF MINE, DAVE CHOI, DID SOME WORK ON THIS WHERE YOU CAN SEE DUST DEVIL TRACKS ALL OVER THE PLACE, BECAUSE WHAT I SAID EARLIER, YOU HAVE THIS BRIGHT RED DUST THAT GETS KIND OF LAID DOWN UNIFORMLY OVER THE SURFACE. >> MM-HMM. >> AND WHEN A DUST DEVIL COMES THROUGH IT’LL SUCK THAT UP OFF THE SURFACE AND MOVE IT SOMEWHERE ELSE. SO YOU SEE THESE TRACKS OF DUST DEVILS ALL OVER THE PLACE. >> OH. >> AND AT FIRST WE DIDN’T REALLY KNOW WHAT WE WERE LOOKING AT. AND THEN SOMEBODY, I FORGET WHO, SAID, “HEY, THOSE ARE DUST DEVIL TRACKS.” AND YEAH, THEY ARE ALL OVER THE PLACE ON MARS. WE HAVE SEEN THEM EVERYWHERE-- EVERYWHERE WE’VE BEEN LOOKING WE HAVE SEEN THEM. >> IT’S JUST AMAZING THAT YOU CAN THINK OF-- YOU CAN IMAGINE WHAT’S GOING ON AT THE SURFACE LEVEL OF ANOTHER PLANET. >> YEAH. >> AS IF IT’S JUST LIKE ANOTHER PLACE ON EARTH, BUT WE’RE TALKING ABOUT ANOTHER-- >> ON A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT PLANET. >> YEAH, A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT PLANET. THAT IS WILD. >> YEAH. AND ANOTHER THING THAT PHOENIX SAW IS WE ACTUALLY SAW SNOW AND FROST DEPOSITION. I MEAN, IT WAS TEENY, TEENY, TINY BIT OF SNOW. >> RIGHT. >> BUT IT WAS SNOW, SO-- >> YEAH. IT’S KIND OF LIKE HOW IN-- I MEAN, LIKE I SAID, I’M FROM PENNSYLVANIA AND WE GET SNOW ALL THE TIME. BUT HERE, WHEN THERE’S SNOW EVERYONE LOSES THEIR MINDS. >> YES, YEAH. IT MIGHT BE-- WELL, SO IT MIGHT SNOW ON MARS MORE FREQUENTLY THAN IN HOUSTON. IT DOESN’T SNOW A LOT. >> OH, I WOULD LIKE TO SEE SNOW ON MARS. THAT WOULD BE PRETTY COOL. SO I MEAN, BEING A PLANETARY SCIENTIST AND KIND OF-- I MEAN, YOU’VE ALLUDED TO A LOT, YOU KNOW, TALKING BOOTS ON THE GROUND, THIS IS WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO, THIS IS WHAT HAVE TO THINK. >> UH-HUH. >> I’M ASSUMING YOU’VE THOUGHT A LOT ABOUT WHAT A HUMAN MISSION TO MARS WOULD HAVE TO LOOK LIKE TO BE SUCCESSFUL. >> FROM A SCIENTIFIC PERSPECTIVE? >> YES. >> OR A-- YEAH, SO I WOULD SAY PROBABLY THE HOLY GRAIL FROM A SCIENTIFIC PERSPECTIVE-- AND THIS IS ONE OF THE THINGS THAT HUMANS WOULD REALLY ENABLE WAS IT WOULD BE THE ABILITY TO DRILL. >> AH. >> BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, WE SAY-- ON MSO WE HAVE A DRILL AND THAT’S TRUE, BUT WE CAN DRILL DOWN ALL OF 6 CENTIMETERS. >> HMM. >> SO A COUPLE-- LIKE 3 INCHES, 2.5 INCHES, SO NOT VERY FAR. WE ARE LITERALLY JUST SCRATCHING THE SURFACE OF MARS. >> YEAH. >> AND IF YOU WANT TO GO TO A PLACE-- AGAIN, GETTING BACK TO THE RADIATION ENVIRONMENT, THE RADIATION-- YOU HAVE A LOT OF RADIATION OR ENERGY DEPOSITION IN THE TOP METER OF MARTIAN SOIL. >> MM-HMM. >> SO ANY LIFE THAT EXISTED THERE THAT WAS MAYBE BILLIONS OF YEARS OLD HAS BEEN EITHER HEAVILY TRANSFORMED OR COMPLETELY DESTROYED. SO IT WOULD BE REALLY HARD TO FIND THE SIGNATURE OF LIFE ANYWHERE WITHIN THE TOP METER. SO WE NEED TO GO DEEPER AND IF YOU WANT TO GO REALLY DEEP YOU NEED HUMANS. BECAUSE DRILLING IS SOMETHING THAT IS VERY DIFFICULT TO DO KIND OF IN AN AUTOMATED WAY EVEN ON THE EARTH. >> MM-HMM. >> YOU NEED PEOPLE THERE TO KIND OF TROUBLESHOOT WHEN THINGS GO WRONG AND FIX STUFF THAT BREAKS OR WHATEVER. SO THAT TO ME IS ONE OF THE THINGS THAT HUMANS WOULD DO. THE OTHER THING IS, I THINK WE HAVE-- WE’VE BEEN STUDYING MARS FROM THE SURFACE FOR 40 YEARS NOW, BUT STILL WE’VE ONLY LANDED IN-- LET’S SEE, WE HAVE VIKING LANDER 1 AND 2, PATHFINDER, MER, PHOENIX, MSL. SO 7 SUCCESSFUL LANDINGS ON THE SURFACE OF MARS. SO THAT’S LIKE SAYING PICK 7 PLACES ON EARTH, SPREAD OUT BY 1,000 MILES OR SO EACH, AND TELL ME ABOUT THE ENTIRE PLANET. AND OBVIOUSLY THAT’S NOT-- LIKE, THE WHOLE HISTORY OF THE PLANET OVER 4.5 BILLION YEARS, AND BY THE WAY, YOU CAN ONLY GO ABOUT 10 KILOMETERS FROM WHEREVER YOU LAND. >> WOW. >> SO WE HAVE-- THERE ARE SO MANY OTHER PLACES ON MARS THAT WE KNOW NOTHING ABOUT. THAT YOU LOOK FROM ORBIT AND SAY, “WHAT THE HECK HAPPENED THERE?” >> YEAH. >> “WHAT IS THIS? WHAT’S GOING ON THERE?” AND THERE’S A LOT OF PLACES FROM ORBIT AS WELL WHERE SOME PLACES WE CAN KIND OF TELL SOMETHING ABOUT THE MINERALOGY. OTHER PLACES THERE ARE COMPLETELY COVERED IN DUST, SO WE REALLY HAVE NO IDEA WHAT THE MINERALOGY IS OF WHAT’S UNDERNEATH IT. SO ANOTHER THING THAT HUMANS WILL GIVE YOU IS THE ABILITY TO GO FARTHER FROM WHEREVER YOU’RE STARTING. AND AGAIN, THE BOOTS ON THE GROUND PEOPLE SAYING, “HEY, THIS LOOKS REALLY INTERESTING. LET’S CHASE THIS DOWN AND GO THERE.” ALSO, WE WOULD BE GREATLY BENEFITED BY BRINGING SAMPLES BACK FROM MARS ON PURPOSE WHERE WE KNOW WHERE THEY COME FROM. >> RIGHT. >> LIKE, WE HAVE MARTIAN METEORITES, BUT WE DON’T REALLY KNOW WHERE THEY CAME FROM. >> MM-HMM. >> SO KNOWING THE CONTEXT OF THE SAMPLES AND BEING ABLE TO USE THE INSTRUMENTS THAT WE HAVE ON EARTH, WHICH ARE MUCH BETTER THAN THE INSTRUMENTS THAT WE SEND TO MARS, BECAUSE OF SIZE, VOLUME, POWER, OR WHATEVER. WE COULD DO A LOT WITH A SAMPLE RETURNED FROM MARS AND ASTRONAUTS-- LIKE FROM THE MOON, ASTRONAUTS BROUGHT BACK HUNDREDS OF KILOGRAMS OF SAMPLES. >> MM-HMM. >> NOW, IT’S A BIT MORE EXPENSIVE TO GET BACK-- OR STUFF BAC FROM MARS. SO WE MIGHT NOT HAVE QUITE AS MANY SAMPLES, BUT WE WOULD HAVE-- WE’D BRING-- WE’D DEFINITELY BRING BACK SAMPLES WITH THE ASTRONAUTS. SO THAT’S ANOTHER THING THAT HAVING PEOPLE THERE ON THE GROUND ENABLE YOU TO DO. >> YEAH. KNOWING THE SCIENCE-- THIS WILL BE THE LAST QUESTION AND THEN WE’LL-- AND THEN WE’LL KIND OF WRAP UP. >> OKAY. >> BUT KNOWING THE SCIENCE OF THE PLANET, KIND OF WHAT ARE SOME OF THE KEY THINGS THAT WE HAVE TO BE PAYING ATTENTION FOR TO MAKE SURE THAT HUMANS CAN SURVIVE AND OPERATE IN THE MOST EFFICIENT WAY? BECAUSE LIKE YOU MENTIONED RADIATION A COUPLE TIMES. RADIATIO IS OBVIOUSLY A CONCERN, BUT WHAT DO WE HAVE TO THINK ABOUT IN TERMS OF THE WAY WE MOVE AND HOW FAR WE CAN GO. >> YEAH. >> YOU OBVIOUSLY SAID YOU ALREADY TALKED ABOUT A MISSION PROFILE HOW LONG WE CAN BE THERE. >> RIGHT. SO YEAH, RADIATION IS ONE OF THE BIG ONES. WE’RE STILL NOT TOTALLY SURE HOW THE HUMAN BODY WORKS FOR A LONG PERIOD OF TIME IN A LOWER GRAVITY SITUATION. LIKE, WE HAVE PEOPLE IN ZERO G, RIGHT. >> RIGHT. >> BUT MARS IS 40% THE GRAVITY OF THE EARTH. WE DON’T REALLY KNOW WHAT THE EFFECTS ARE OF THE HUMAN BODY. UNFORTUNATELY, THAT’S INCREDIBLY DIFFICULT TO SIMULATE, SO WE PROBABLY REALLY WON’T KNOW UNTIL WE GO. >> RIGHT. >> OTHERWISE, THOUGH, THERE ARE OTHER KIND OF ENVIRONMENTAL HAZARDS THAT YOU NEED TO BE AWARE OF, LIKE YOU REFERRED TO THE DUST. SO THAT’S SOMETHING THAT YOU JUST NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU HAVE GOOD FILTRATION SYSTEMS. >> OH, OKAY. >> IT’S-- ONE OF THE MAIN PROBLEMS FOR THE DUST THOUGH IS FOR THE SUITS. LIKE, IF YOU HAVE A SPACESUIT WITH SEALS AND YOU HAVE JOINTS THAT MOVE, AND YOU HAVE DUST, GETTING INTO THOSE JOINTS, WHICH WE KNOW IT WILL. IT DID ON THE MOON. >> MM-HMM. >> THEN THAT CAN BE-- THAT CAN BE PROBLEMATIC. SO HOW DO YOU DESIGN YOUR SEALS? HOW MANY REPLACEMENT SEALS DO YOU NEED? OR DESIGN YOUR SPACESUIT TO BE REPAIRABLE BY THE ASTRONAUTS ON MARS. AND I MEAN, BUT THIS IS ALSO KIND OF AN OPEN QUESTION IS THAT WE DON’T REALLY KNOW THE NATURE OF MARTIAN DUST. WE DON’T KNOW IF IT WILL BE KIND OF AS SHARP AND DAMAGING AS SOME OF THE LUNAR DUST, BECAUSE THE LUNAR DUST AND MARS DUST FORM IN TWO DIFFERENT WAYS. LIKE, WE KNOW THAT-- WE KNOW THE AVERAGE PARTICLE SIZE OF THE MARTIAN DUST THAT GETS INTO THE ATMOSPHERE IS LIKE 5 MICRONS, BUT-- SO THAT’S GREAT. IT’S GOOD TO KNOW THAT, BUT YOU NEED TO KNOW A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT THE SIZE, SHAPE, HARDNESS, THOSE KINDS OF THINGS IN THE DUST ABOUT THE DUST WHEN YOU’RE TALKING TO PEOPLE ABOUT SEALS FOR SPACESUITS AND SPACECRAFT. THE OTHER THING IS BEING AWARE OF POTENTIAL TOXIC THINGS ON THE SURFACE, LIKE PERCHLORATE, FOR EXAMPLE, WHICH IS AN OXIDIZED CHLORINE THAT-- MOLECULE THAT THE PHOENIX LANDER DISCOVERED IN 2008. AND SO, WE KNOW THAT PERCHLORATE IS TOXIC TO PEOPLE. >> MM-HMM. >> BUT IN REALLY HIGH QUANTITIES. SO IT’S LESS OF A CONCERN FOR INHALATION FOR PEOPLE, HOWEVER MUCH PERCHLORATE MIGHT BE IN THE DUST. SO AS I LIKE TO TELL PEOPLE, AS LONG AS YOUR ASTRONAUTS ARE NOT EATING KILOGRAMS OF SOIL EVERY DAY THEY’RE FINE. BUT-- >> KILOGRAMS OF-- >> YEAH, IT REALLY WOULD HAVE TO BE-- >> THAT’S A LOT OF SOIL. >> YEAH, RIGHT. SO THAT’S GENERALLY FAIRLY LOW ON, “HEY, GUYS, DON’T EAT DIRT.” “YEAH, OKAY, WE GOT IT.” WE CHECKED THAT ONE OFF. >> VERY TEMPTING, BUT RESIST. >> YEAH, BUT SO THE ONE THING THAT WE DO HAVE TO-- WE DO HAVE TO DO MORE RESEARCH INTO IS THERE ARE-- IF YOU GROW PLANTS IN SOIL THAT HAVE PERCHLORATE THERE ARE SOME PLANTS THAT CAN CONCENTRATE PERCHLORATE IN CERTAIN PARTS OF THE PLANET. SO YOU NEED TO KNOW, OKAY, IF WE’RE PLANNING ON LIVING OFF OF THIS, FIRST OF ALL, CAN IT GROW IN A SOIL THAT HAS PERCHLORATE? AND IF IT DOES, WHAT-- WHERE DOES THE PERCHLORATE GO? IS THIS SOMETHING THAT WE NEED TO BE CONCERNED ABOUT. >> MM-HMM. >> SO THESE ARE-- THOSE ARE KIND OF QUESTIONS THAT WE’RE ANSWERING. BUT THE EXCITING THING IS THAT WE HAVE THE DATA TO ACTUALLY BE ABLE TO ADDRESS THOSE QUESTIONS, RIGHT. >> YEAH. >> LIKE, I MEAN, 40 YEARS AGO AT THE END OF APOLLO WHEN WE TALKED-- FIRST TALKED ABOUT GOING ON TO MARS, WE DIDN’T KNOW ANY OF THIS STUFF. >> RIGHT. >> WE DIDN’T-- WE HARDLY KNEW ANYTHING ABOUT MARS, BUT NOW WE HAVE A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF EXPERIENCE AND A LARGE BODY OF KNOWLEDGE ABOUT WHAT THE SURFACE OF MARS IS LIKE. WHAT-- ALL THE STUFF WE TALKED ABOUT TODAY. WHAT IS THE WEATHER LIKE? WHAT’S THE TEMPERATURE? WHAT’S THE PRESSURE? WHAT’S THE CHEMICAL COMPOSITION? WHAT’S THE MINERALOGY? WHAT ARE THE PHYSICAL PROPERTIES OF THE SOIL? IF YOU WANT TO BUILD SOMETHING THERE OR LAND SOMETHING  WHAT’S IT LIKE? WHAT ARE THE THINGS THAT WE NEED TO WORRY ABOUT? AND THAT’S WHAT’S REALLY KIND OF AMAZING ABOUT THE JOURNEY TO MARS RIGHT NOW IS THAT REALLY, FOR THE FIRST TIME, WE HAVE THE INFORMATION TO GO OUT. AND WE KNOW THE QUESTIONS THAT WE NEED TO ANSWER. WE DON’T KNOW THE ANSWERS TO ALL THE QUESTIONS YET, BUT FOR THE MOST PART WE KNOW A LOT OF THE QUESTIONS THAT WE NEED TO ANSWER. >> MM-HMM. >> AND I’LL JUST ADD ONE FINAL THING SO YOU DON’T THINK THAT IT’S ALL BAD. THERE’S A LOT OF STUFF IN A LOT OF THE WORK THAT WE’RE DOING ISN’T JUST WHAT ARE THE BAD THINGS ABOUT MARS, BUT WHAT’S ON MARS THAT WE CAN USE FOR HUMANS TO HELP ENABLE FUTURE EXPLORATION. >> HEY, YEAH. >> LIKE THERE’S AN INSTRUMENT CALLED MOXIE AND I’M SORRY THAT’S AN ACRONYM THAT I DON’T KNOW WHAT IT STANDS FOR. BUT BASICALLY, IT INGESTS ATMOSPHERE AND IT BREAKS THE CARBON DIOXIDE AND OXYGEN-- SO YOU’RE FORMING OXYGEN. OXYGEN WHICH THE IDEA IS YOU’D USE THAT FOR YOUR OXIDIZER IN ROCKET FUEL. >> NICE. >> AND YOU CAN ALSO-- ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I’M DIRECTLY INVOLVED IN IS TRYING TO EXTRACT WATER OUT OF MARTIAN MATERIAL. SO WATER CAN BE REALLY USEFUL BECAUSE ASTRONAUTS NEED WATER TO DRINK FOR FOOD. YOU CAN BREAK THE WATER THROUGH ELECTROLYSIS OR OTHER WAYS INTO HYDROGEN AND OXYGEN. YOU CAN BREATH THE OXYGEN. HYDROGEN AND OXYGEN CAN BE USED AS ROCKET FUELS OR FUEL FOR A FUEL CELL. THERE’S ALL KINDS OF STUFF THAT YOU CAN DO JUST WITH WATER. >> MM-HMM. >> AND SO, EVERY KILOGRAM OF MATERIAL THAT WE DON’T HAVE TO BRING WITH US MAKES IT MORE LIKELY THAT WE WILL ACTUALLY BE ABLE TO GO BECAUSE IT LOWERS THE COST AND COMPLEXITY OF THE OVERALL MISSION. SO WE’RE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT FROM WHAT’S ON-- WHAT IS ON MARS TODAY THAT WE CAN USE TO OUR ADVANTAGE. AND AGAIN, THIS IS-- THESE ARE QUESTIONS THAT WE’RE NOW ABLE TO ANSWER BASED ON THE EXPLORATION WORK THAT WE’VE DONE OVER THE PAST 40 YEARS. >> THAT’S AWESOME. I’M EXCITED. I WANT TO GO TO MARS LIKE RIGHT NOW. >> ME, TOO. LET’S DO IT. >> THAT WAS A NICE LITTLE SUMMARY OF LIKE ALL THE THINGS WE TALKED ABOUT, TOO. THAT WAS GREAT. WELL, I THINK THAT’S ALL THE TIME WE HAVE. DOUG, THANKS FOR COMING ON THE SHOW TODAY. >> MY PLEASURE. >> THAT WAS AWESOME. SO COOL. I LEARNED SO MUCH ABOUT MARS. I HAD SO MANY QUESTIONS AND LIKE ALMOST ALL OF THEM GOT ANSWERED. FOR THE LISTENERS, IF YOU DO WANT TO KNOW MORE, I’D BE SURPRISED, BUT ACTUALLY THERE ARE WAY MORE QUESTIONS. WE CAN TALK FOREVER ABOUT MARS. BUT IF YOU WANT TO STAY TUNED AFTER THE MUSIC THAT WE HAVE AT THE END HERE, WE’LL TALK TO ALL THE SITES YOU CAN GO TO AND LEARN MORE, AND MAYBE YOU’LL FIND A QUESTION THAT YOU WANT TO ASK AND WE’LL TELL YOU HOW TO SUBMIT THAT. SO THANKS AGAIN, DOUG, FOR COMING ON THE SHOW. >> YOU’RE WELCOME. >> WE’LL SEE YOU MAYBE NEXT TIME? MAYBE ONE MORE TIME, WHO KNOWS. >> SURE. [ MUSIC ] >> HOUSTON, GO AHEAD. >> I’M ON THE SPACE SHUTTLE. >> ROGER, ZERO-G AND I FEEL FINE. >> SHUTTLE HAS CLEARED THE TOWER. >> WE CAME IN PEACE FOR ALL MANKIND. >> IT’S ACTUALLY A HUGE HONOR TO BREAK THE RECORD LIKE THIS. >> NOT BECAUSE THEY ARE EASY, BUT BECAUSE THEY ARE HARD. >> HOUSTON, WELCOME TO SPACE. >> HEY, THANKS FOR STICKING AROUND. SO TODAY, WE TALKED ABOUT MARS, THE RED PLANET, AND EVERYTHING ABOUT IT. BUT WHEN I SAY EVERYTHING I DON’T TRULY MEAN EVERYTHING. OBVIOUSLY THERE’S A LOT MORE. WE MAY DO ANOTHER PODCAST IN THE FUTURE, BUT IF YOU WANT TO KNOW MORE ABOUT THE RED PLANET RIGHT NOW JUST GO TO NASA.GOV.

                        "description": "Gary Jordan (Host): Houston, we have a podcast. Welcome to the official podcast of the NASA Johnson Space Center, Episode 190, \"Before His Second Flight.\" I'm Gary Jordan and I'll be your host today. If you are new to the show, we bring in NASA experts to talk about all different parts of our space agency and sometimes we get lucky enough to bring in astronauts to tell their story. So today, we're talking with Mark Vande Hei. He's a U.S. Astronaut who is about to launch to the International Space Station for his second-long duration spaceflight. He happened to be one of the very first gets we had on the podcast back in Episode 13, “Before His First Flight,” which happened to be the title of that episode. So, in this discussion we talked about his background and anticipation of heading to space, basically continuing the conversation from 2017. We discussed how his first flight ended up going and what he did aboard. We discussed his return and what he's been up to here in NASA since landing in the Kazak steppe. And of course, what he's looking forward to this time around, and how the landscape of the International Space Station has changed in the few short years he spent back on the planet. So, here's a little bit more about astronaut Mark Vande Hei. Enjoy!  [ Music]  Host: Mark Vande Hei, thanks for coming back on Houston We have a Podcast.  Mark Vande Hei: Oh, it's good to be here. Thanks for inviting me.  Host: Hey, I'm just going to pick up from where we last left off. You were one of our first astronaut guests, actually, on this podcast. You were Episode 13. We called that \"Before His First Flight.\" And really, we had that conversation up through the moment right before you were heading over to -- I think it was either Moscow or Baikonur at the time, but really just before your first launch. I want to pick up the conversation from right there. So, from when you last left the studio and you were getting ready for your first launch, what were some of the things that you were doing, some of the thoughts going through your head?  Mark Vande Hei: Oh gosh, that's a long -- a lot's happened since then, of course. So, before launch, there's a lot of ceremonial stuff along with the final exams, of course. I guess I'll just go to the really interesting part and try to keep this answer short. The launch. So, the launch, for me, happened 0 Dark Thirty, I can't remember the exact time. I just do remember it was a not a normal time for me to be awake. Very emotional when you're driving away to say goodbye to everybody. And there's a huge crowd of people cheering you on and you feel like a rock star and then it was shocking though how excited you could feel and then it gets really quiet on the bus and it's dark out and you're driving out into the desert in Kazakhstan to a rocket that's all by itself. And then we got out to the rocket and we got on and I remember thinking to myself, \"Oh my gosh, this thing is leaving in --\" it was less than two hours and I thought to myself, \"I have a lot to do.\" So, we got into the spacecraft and they close us in, get us securely buckled down and then everybody else leaves and you're just sitting out there. So, I guess what I'm trying to convey is a sense of tremendous community and celebratory, and then shockingly quiet and isolated.  Host: Wow.  Mark Vande Hei: And so that was an emotional flip that I didn't expect. Once you get into the process of going through all the checklist to prepare for the launch, that starts seeming, you've practiced this multiple times, you're very focused and even the launch, the launch was so smooth that the biggest shock to me was that nothing went wrong, because all of our training has things going wrong every moment. And so, I was constantly scanning, trying to find the problem that was in the system somewhere because that's what I was trained to do. And there was always something hidden if I just looked carefully enough. But nope, everything worked perfectly. So, I kind of wanted a better story. It wasn't shaky enough. It wasn't violent enough. It was really smooth. And then when you get to orbit and the thrusters are turned off, you really are in a free fall. That's what being in orbit is. You're just falling towards the Earth, but constantly missing it. And it shocked me how it felt just like being at the top of a roller coaster, when you're coming up over the top of a roller coaster and you rise up in the straps. Of course, I was strapped down very tightly. So, when you in a roller coaster, hopefully you're strapped down very tightly too. And if the roller coaster comes over the top and goes from going up to down rapidly, you'll rise up in the seat. Well, that's what I experienced. The reason you feel that in a roller coaster is because you're in a momentary free fall, very short time. For me, it was exactly like that, but it continued for hours. So, that was just a strange sensation that it kept going. And also, kind of had this feeling like I was rotating forward, but very slowly I was rotating forward too. The sunlight was interesting. It's gorgeous, very bright. But there's something a little unsettling about it. And actually, went to a preview in Washington D.C. for \"First Man.\" And I watched the movie and I was really impressed with how they conveyed that feeling in that movie of being in a capsule. And I said, \"something about the lighting that you guys did was great.\" And the director told me, \"Oh yeah, we had a NASA consultant. They said, \"Make sure you use spotlighting.\" I said, \"Spotlighting? What are you talking about?\" He said, \"Yeah, spotlighting. Because the sun is a spotlight when you're out in space.\" And it occurred to me that every time I've experienced any sunlight before I was in orbit, it was always scattered by the atmosphere of the Earth. So, you never really get sunlight that's just direct from one spot. It's always coming from multiple directions because it hits other parts of the atmosphere and gets bent in your direction too. So that's why it was beautiful but weird, if that makes sense. And I couldn't put my finger on what is unsettling about this. So, it was very stark brightness and stark darkness in the shadows as we quickly would move as the spacecraft would go to different angles with the sun. And they had this little window next to me. Getting to the space station, I'll never forget looking out over my left shoulder and seeing the solar rays, much bigger than I ever expected them to be. I lost my composure a little bit, because I was so excited and said, \"Wow,\" during a moment in the spaceflight when we were all supposed to be very quiet and concentrating intensely on the data that we were seeing, the telemetry. Life on the space station was really busy. Got to do lots of spacewalks. Vehicle -- did one vehicle capture. Coming back to Earth, I guess, I really what I want to do is tell you a few things instead of going on for 25 minutes. And then if there's something that's interesting to you, then you can ask me more. So, I'm going to very quickly go through this.  Host: OK.  Mark Vande Hei: The landing process, I didn't realize how afraid I was while I was waiting for the parachute to open and had nothing to do but wait for the parachute to open, until the parachute actually opened and I felt so giddy, because I was super, super happy. That was the first time I had let myself realize that this was actually going to succeed. I was also very shocked with the impact with the ground. In fact, my immediate emotion was I felt angry. I felt like someone had just hit me in the back of the head with a two-by-four, because it was a hard hit. We were fine. Everybody was safe. It was very safe. But it was shocking.  Host: Yeah, they say it's like something like a 30 mile an hour car crash is like the -- is like kind of the feeling.  Mark Vande Hei: I've never been in a 30 mile an hour car crash, but it certainly caught my attention.  Host: Yeah.  Mark Vande Hei: In fact, I made a mistake. One of the things the Russians tell you to prepare for that landing is make sure your head is back in the seat and your mouth is closed. You don't want to bite your tongue if you hit hard. And I thought to myself, \"Well my muscles will probably be weak enough, I won't have had to balance my head. So, keeping my head in the seat shouldn't be a problem. So, just remember to keep your mouth closed.\" I did remember that I should have my head in the seat. But the -- I thought we had about ten seconds before we hit, and I looked up to check something out and then we hit.  Host: Oh.  Mark Vande Hei: So, I hit my head really hard.  Host: Snapped it back. Yeah.  Mark Vande Hei: Yeah. So, I actually was wondering if I made a big enough mistake that I was going to have a concussion, but I was fine.  Host: OK.  Mark Vande Hei: It was no big deal.  Host: While you were in space though, you had -- I mean it was 100 -- let me see, I have the number here somewhere.  Mark Vande Hei: Talking about number of science experiments?  Host: I was going to say number of days, 168.  Mark Vande Hei: Oh yes, yes.  Host: But I'm sure you did a couple hundred science experiments as well.  Mark Vande Hei: I don't know how many I personally did, I know as a team some of which happened to be without our interaction even, there was 234 science experiments that happened while we were onboard.  Host: Yeah, I like the way you described it too, because I think you've done multiple interviews since you've been back, and you know, one of the top things is you know, what are some of the science investigations that you did. And you always describe yourself as, you know, I was more of like a -- there's the lab hands, you know, I was just like the hands just kind of doing the work. That's how you felt, right?  Mark Vande Hei: Yeah, I call it being a laboratory technician.  Host: Technician, yeah.  Mark Vande Hei: My job was to make sure that all the science experiments had the resources they needed. Very rarely was I an observer.  Host: Yeah.  Mark Vande Hei: A lot of times I was just making sure the videos were set up so that they could do the observation. Certainly, wasn't doing any data analysis or writing papers like a scientist would do.  Host: Yeah, and there was -- but there was a lot of work, right. Because you were just -- you were the one lab technician for all these different scientists that had all these different priorities that they wanted to do.  Mark Vande Hei: Because there's so many experiments going on simultaneously, yeah there's no lack of work. In fact, there's more work than we can get done.  Host: Yeah. Always a task list, right. That's just hard to get to. You did a couple spacewalks as well, and I know those were a highlight for you during your first Expedition.  Mark Vande Hei: Yeah, they were, yeah. Good experiences. Everyone I was happy to start and everyone I was happy to finish.  Host: What were some of those lessons that you were learning? Because you're about to go back to the International Space Station, I don't know if spacewalks are on the table, but they certainly could be. So, some of those things you know you're going to take forward with you on those spacewalks given your recent experience.  Mark Vande Hei: So, if I do another spacewalk, things that I will continue to do differently than my first spacewalk is move gently. So, as you can imagine, training under water you overcome water drag. So, every time you want to start moving you impart a force and the water is going to stop you. So, you have to keep adding force to continue moving. If you keep adding force to continue moving in space, you're just going to keep accelerating. That's undesirable. So, my first spacewalk I put in a lot of force to start moving. I had to take out all that force in the opposite direction to stop moving. So, I worked really, really hard. So, when I get back there, I'm sure I'll very gently start motion, make sure I maintain contact, but you can just keep fingertip contact as you wait to get to the right spot, assuming your aim was good enough.  Host: Yeah.  Mark Vande Hei: Another thing that became very helpful on spacewalks after my first was instead of being really, really afraid of letting go with both hands from the space station -- now, just in case someone is concerned, when we let go with both hands from the space station, it's only after we put down a tether that keeps the space station within arms' reach. So, I'm not talking about just letting go and hoping that I just stay in the vicinity. There's lots of safety features to make sure we stay safe. But, there's a big difference between being in the middle of rotating yourself and then letting go while you're rotating, because you'll start to just do a spiral.  Host: Yeah.  Mark Vande Hei: That's very uncomfortable. Versus stopping yourself for three seconds, making sure there's no relative motion between you and the space station and then slowly letting go with your fingers. Because once you're done letting go, you'll stay exactly there. There's a little bit of force from the safety tether, but that didn't seem like a big impact to me. And that makes it much more casual.  Host: It sounds like there's a lot -- so you trained a lot in the Neutral Buoyancy Laboratory. There's a lot that you can learn under water. But it seems like all these lessons are just that little gap between doing it under water and doing it for real.  Mark Vande Hei: Absolutely.  Host: The motions that you make. I mean that's really the difference there.  Mark Vande Hei: Yes. Every -- the NBL does an incredibly good job of training us. There's just a few little nuances that they can't quite replicate and yeah, you can learn a lot.  Host: Well, let's go back to -- you had that hard landing over in Kazakhstan. What have you been up to since, since you returned to Houston?  Mark Vande Hei: So, everybody who comes back from a spaceflight does a process of debriefings, rehabilitation, and also public events. We travel around for a bit. Share your experience. For me, that ended with me going to Washington D.C. to work as a technical assistant for Bill Gerstenmaier. So, I did that for a while. That was super interesting. I got to see how things work in Washington D.C. at NASA and I very much appreciate the hard work that those folks do. And then I came back to Houston again and worked as the EVA and Robotics assistant to the chief astronaut until I got this assignment.  Host: Wow. OK, so you -- I mean, it sounds like a lot of that time has been -- so some of those lessons that you learned from your spacewalk. What do you do as the -- I guess, leading EVAs and Robotics? What are some of your tasks?  Mark Vande Hei: So, one task is giving recommendations to the chief astronaut for who will do spacewalks.  Host: Oh OK.  Mark Vande Hei: And of course, that comes along with staffing it with the trainers and staffing it with the flight directors to see if anybody has got concerns, but then giving the chief astronaut a recommendation that it will actually work. Same thing with robotic operations on the space station. A big part of the job was also providing some continuity in what the ground team should expect from astronauts. For example, we had a lot -- we had 13 spacewalks in a year, recently. And there's a lot of desire to do spacewalks really, really quickly. And my job in some cases was to share what situation that would create for the people actually executing the spacewalk. And to talk to them, if we ended up doing things pretty rapidly or maybe we decided we're going to go ahead and have to do it this quickly, make sure everyone understood that this is something we haven't done before with space station crew members, who are different from space shuttle crew members. Because space shuttle crew members used to get trained multiple times on a very specific EVA, whereas space station crew members don't get trained as much on a specific task, but they'll get trained for years on generic tasks and have to adapt to whatever we tell them that they need to do. Of course, they're also spending more time in space so that has effects as well. And then training wise, so we had an astronaut candidate class that was finishing up as I was still working in that job. And what does it mean to say that somebody is certified to do EVAs? Or certified to operate the robotic arm? Things like that. Making sure we had a consistent grading and were fair, both maintaining a really high standard, but also making sure it's the same standard for everybody.  Host: That's very true. Yeah. And I didn't really think about the tasks of a spacewalk. I guess you're right. I mean when you're doing a shuttle, you train exactly for what you're going to do. There is a lot of challenges, not only -- and you described it so well -- not only with training, providing a generic training so that you can adapt to whatever task needs to be accomplished, but if you're talking about so many EVAs, so many spacewalks in a short period of time, when you yourself are in space for a long period of time, it could feel a little bit draining. I don't know if you've experienced that yourself in space, just having to do so many tasks. We talked about spacewalks. We talked about different science experiments. If you felt a sense of, \"man, there's a lot to do in just these short six months.\"  Mark Vande Hei: I definitely felt like there's a lot to do. I felt very fortunate because I think between my first and second spacewalk there was -- it was a five-day center to center. So, hatch opening on the first spacewalk to hatch opening on the second spacewalk was five days. I thought that was perfect, because that also happened over the course -- during that time I had a weekend off, which gave me a whole weekend to study for the next spacewalk and to think about it. So that was ideal for me. And I think had I had spacewalks four months apart, it would have been harder to carry the lessons learned from the first spacewalk into the second spacewalk. So, they were so quick for me that that was really helpful, but far enough apart I didn't have any lingering effects. I didn't have -- sometimes people lose fingernails after a spacewalk. You can have a lot of hand soreness. I had enough -- I didn't have anything serious enough that I wasn't completely recovered before the second spacewalk. So, we got to pay attention to that having physical recovery and enough mental time to get mentally prepared for the next thing too. But for me it was, I was very fortunate. Months later I did another spacewalk. I can't remember how quickly they were in succession, the third and fourth one, but I was definitely a fan of being able to -- once I start spacewalks, focus on that and do nothing else, ideally, as opposed to flipping between science and spacewalk stuff.  Host: Yup. A lot has happened since you've returned, when you talked about, you know, your main task. You did a little bit of time at headquarters and then you came back, and you were working EVAs and robotics. But a lot has happened, especially in the astronaut world. We have commercial crew astronauts. We've assigned astronauts to walk on the Moon. There's just a lot happening in your office. Talk about that landscape from when you landed to right now. Just like, how the astronaut office itself has really changed.  Mark Vande Hei: It's interesting you mentioned those things as changes to the astronaut office, because I think the thing that feels like the biggest effect is COVID right now. Because we're not seeing each other. I'm fortunate because I've been going to training and I get to see people that are making sure they're well protected and that I'm well protected, but I get to interact with people. But if you're not assigned to a flight, you're doing your job from home, just like everybody else. And it's challenging just like for everybody else. It's a very dynamic time in the astronaut office, which if I was a new astronaut I would think, it's the perfect time to be here because opportunities are just going to blossom.  Host: Yeah.  Mark Vande Hei: There's going to be challenges, but that's also always opportunities for growth and gives you great ways to contribute. So, I think there's a lot to look forward to right now.  Host: I know you're not really together then because of COVID, right. You're not seeing each other as often, but I wonder if you've experienced -- you talked about the new astronauts, I'm thinking of the astronauts that came in 2017, or as candidates and now they're astronauts and some of them have already been assigned to a few flights. I wonder if you're seeing that from that class of astronauts, a sense of excitement on what we have ahead of us?  Mark Vande Hei: Oh my gosh, yes. Many of them are assigned to that Artemis team --  Host: Yeah.  Mark Vande Hei: -- to be ready to walk on the Moon someday. That's certainly exciting. Some are assigned to be ready for a Soyuz potentially or back or some are primary crew members for Dragon spacecraft if I understand correctly. Yeah, there's a lot going on.  Host: Very much so. Now, going back to you, you have this flight coming up. You're going to be flying Soyuz again. What are some of the next things that you're looking forward to? Is it much of the same? Has it changed a little bit?  Mark Vande Hei: It's going to be very different for me.  Host: OK.  Mark Vande Hei: Knock on wood, being on that Soyuz crew because this time I'll be in the right seat as opposed to the left seat. The left seat was being a copilot. So, I was fully engaged last time in flying the spacecraft. And sometimes -- most of the time I was pressing the buttons on behalf of the commander, something I definitely didn't want to mess up. This time, my responsibilities in the Soyuz are going to be very minimal. I think every two hours, if I remember correctly, I have to pump the condensate out, 120 pumps in two minutes.  Host: All right.  Mark Vande Hei: That's my job and I jokingly will be like, \"Is it time? Is it time? Can I pump the condensate yet?\" So, I'll be a lot more relaxed.  Host: Cool. Cool.  Mark Vande Hei: And when I get to the space station, I'm hoping that will continue. My goal is to do what people tell me. And I expect a lot of changes and I expect, again, things change but I hope my contribution is going to be just rolling with those changes and keeping a real steady sense of joy about this opportunity and doing my job. I'm probably spending -- I have fewer personal goals this time when I go to the space station. Like last time I had all kinds of things I needed to take pictures of. This time -- and that actually became a stressor because I had limited time and every week, I had a to-do list I was trying to get through. This time I just want to be a little more peaceful about the whole thing and try to enjoy it. Maybe -- I didn't journal last time. I would love to start journaling more and try to capture -- for me, my assumption is that this is going to be my last opportunity to do something like this, so I want to do as good a job as I can to record it for myself if no one else.  Host: That's incredible personal goals. It seems like you've put a lot of thought into the things that you want to do. Are you sharing this with -- I'm sure there's like, I'm going back to the newer class of astronauts, right, you're thinking about this as your last flight and I'm sure like a lot of the newer astronauts are looking forward to doing exactly what you did on your first flight, like, \"I have so much I want to do. I have this huge task list.\" I wonder if there's a benefit to that. Say, absolutely you should do that on your first flight. Or maybe, maybe this next flight that you're talking about, take it easy, journal, you know, decrease stress maybe overall in your workload. Maybe that's a benefit that you can pass on to some of the newer astronauts. Actually, it might be good to take your time.  Mark Vande Hei: It depends on the person.  Host: OK.  Mark Vande Hei: There's Norishige Kanai was on the space station with me.  Host: Yeah.  Mark Vande Hei: He would work on the weekends and work on the task list on the weekends and I just didn't do that. That was my free time and I had my own personal task list. And then I pulled him aside one day and said, \"Hey --\", his call sign is \"Nemo.\" That's how my classmates all call him \"Nemo.\" I said, \"Nemo, you know you don't have to do this on the weekend, right.\" And he said, \"Yeah, but it's actually more pleasant for me to work when I can do it at my own pace.\" So, he gained a sense of peace from getting things done, but without any stress of needing to get it done. So that's why I say everybody is different. Nemo was different from me as far as what our needs were. And I would say even my needs on that first flight might be different from my needs on the second flight. So, we're constantly changing human beings.  Host: Wow. Yeah, you just find that thing that gives you that sense of peace, because I guess that's an important thing to carry with you. You know you're going to be on station for a long time, so you have to find that thing, whatever it may be, because it sounds like it's unique per crew member, but the thing that's going to keep you -- you know, keep you going for that long period of time.  Mark Vande Hei: Yup.  Host: Very cool. Well, Mark Vande Hei, I think that's all the questions I have. I want to wish you the best of luck on your journey and Godspeed. Thanks for talking to me today.  Mark Vande Hei: Thanks very much for having me come today. I appreciate it. Good talking to you again.  Host: Thanks.

                        "description": "Pat Ryan (Host): Houston, we have a podcast. Welcome to the official podcast of the NASA Johnson Space Center, Episode 194, “Artemis Launch Director.” I'm Pat Ryan. On this podcast we talk with scientist, engineers, astronauts, and other folks about their part in America's space exploration program. Today, we're going to take another step in learning the details about the upcoming first flight of the Artemis program. NASA's Artemis program is focused on returning American astronauts to the Moon through the use of the Space Launch System rocket, the Orion spacecraft, the Gateway lunar outpost, a new lunar lander, and the ground systems that support them all. Artemis is about going to the Moon in a sustainable way: that is, to go to the Moon to stay and learn how to support astronauts in that environment; in the process, getting ourselves ready to go on from there to Mars. Back in January, Gary kicked off the series by talking to the Artemis mission manager, Mike Serafin, to get us started understanding what all is involved, and this week, we take another step. When Artemis I launches on the first test flight of the SLS with Orion atop, that launch team will work under the direction of Charlie Blackwell-Thompson, the launch director for the Exploration Ground Systems program at the Kennedy Space Center. A veteran of more than 30 years in the business at KSC and NASA's first female launch director, Blackwell-Thompson started her career with Boeing as a payload flight software engineer and worked as lead electrical engineer for multiple Hubble Space Telescope servicing missions before joining NASA as a test director in the launch and landing division in 2004, working prelaunch processing, tanking, and launch countdown operations. We'll talk about the cool jobs on her resume and what it’s been like getting a new program up on its feet to return American astronauts to the Moon, and the things that we should all be looking for when we watch that first Artemis launch. Artemis I Launch Director, Charlie Blackwell-Thompson. Here we go.  [Music]  Host: When we're starting with a topic like Artemis, something that's pretty new, I think it's important to make sure we understand what we're talking about and make sure that we don't leave people behind, assuming that they know things that maybe we know, so Charlie Blackwell-Thompson, tell me what is Artemis, and what is the goal of this new program?  Charlie Blackwell-Thompson: Well, Artemis is a really exciting program that we have here at NASA, and it's all about returning our country to the Moon, and this time, in a sustainable way, where we can learn to live off of our home planet in preparation for other deep space destinations, and so, you know, we are getting ready for humanity's next great leap, which is sending our astronauts to Mars, so it's a really exciting program for us here in the near term and also for generations to come.  Host: That's a great and succinct explanation of it because sometimes, some people want to pretty it all up, but it's that simple. It's, we're going to the Moon to get ready to go beyond the Moon.  Charlie Blackwell-Thompson: That's right. That is right.  Host: Why is going to the Moon important? What are we going to be able to learn there that we don't already know that we need to know?  Charlie Blackwell-Thompson: Well, it really is about learning. You know, with each exploration initiative, there comes scientific discovery, you know, technology advancement, and along with it, just inspiring a whole new generation toward exploration in STEM (science, technology, engineering, and math), and so, if we look back at Apollo, you know, we're still learning from the samples that we collected during that program.  Host: Right.  Charlie Blackwell-Thompson: And so, if you kind of fast forward and think about all that we're going to learn as we move forward, and we visit new destinations on the lunar surface.  Host: The Artemis program, as I understand it, is structured into a couple of big subgroups. Can you give me the thumbnail explanation of what those different components are that make up the Artemis program?  Charlie Blackwell-Thompson: Absolutely. So, you know, we talked about Artemis is about returning humanity to the Moon. Well, to do that, you need an incredible launch vehicle, and so, our sister program SLS has been developing the flight hardware, the flight elements that make up that very powerful rocket, and likewise, our sister program Orion has been developing the spacecraft that will take our crews into deep space, deeper than we've ever gone before, and so, while Orion and SLS are developing those flight capabilities, my home program, EGS, has been busy developing the systems to support this flight hardware during the prelaunch and the recovery phase, so we've been developing ground systems, enhancing infrastructure, all in preparation for this flight hardware and the processing of it, the integration of it together, the testing of it, and then ultimately, the launch of this Artemis vehicle.  Host: For the benefit of people who aren't aware, SLS is Space Launch System?  Charlie Blackwell-Thompson: Yes, it is.  Host: And EGS, that's your program. That is…  Charlie Blackwell-Thompson: Exploration Ground Systems.  Host: Tell me what's included in -- it sounds like everything that doesn't fly?  Charlie Blackwell-Thompson: Pretty much everything that doesn't fly. If I were to talk about the changes that we've made here since the Space Shuttle Program as an example.  Host: Right.  Charlie Blackwell-Thompson: One that's really near and dear to my heart is right here in the Launch Control Center. When you think about the work that exploration -- when I talk about the work that Exploration Ground Systems has done, I'll kind of touch on the different elements. So, a lot of the facility assets and some of the equipment that we use is from the shuttle program, but the capabilities and the needs of this rocket and spacecraft are really different. So, in the Launch Control Center, we have modernized the Firing Rooms, both Firing Room 1, 2, and 3. Firing Room 1 and 2 are used on day of launch. Firing Room 1 is our prime and our launch-capable Firing Room. If you've ever visited Firing Room 1 back during the shuttle program, you may remember that it had some Apollo-era blue furniture there. That's all been removed and --  Host: OK. [Laughter]  Charlie Blackwell-Thompson: -- replaced with more modern designs, and along with it is also a new suite of software. The shuttle-era software that we had in the Launch Control Center was designed back in the '70s timeframe, '70s and '80s, and so, we've replaced that with newer computing capability and a suite of software that we -- that is really designed specifically for the SLS rocket, the Space Launch System rocket, and the Orion spacecraft. So, here in my home facility, a lot of changes have been made, but it's not limited to the Launch Control Center. If we were to step over to the VAB as another example --  Host: Vehicle Assembly Building, right?  Charlie Blackwell-Thompson: Vehicle Assembly Building. That was our final integration point for shuttle, so back during the shuttle program, we worked on the orbiter over in the Orbiter Processing Facility and then we would roll it over and it would get integrated with the external tank and the boosters in the VAB, the Vehicle Assembly Building --  Host: Mm-hm.  Charlie Blackwell-Thompson: -- and get checked out and then we would go out to the pad for launch. The VAB is also our final integration point for the Artemis vehicle --  Host: OK.  Charlie Blackwell-Thompson: -- but that's where you have your access, your primary access to the vehicle in the vertical and so, if you think about the outer mold line of the shuttle, how different that is from the vehicle that we have, which is an in-line vehicle that stands over 300 feet tall.  Host: Yeah. It's a rocket, as people traditionally think of rockets. It's one long tube. Well, in this case, it's got some attachments, but it doesn't look at all like a space shuttle.  Charlie Blackwell-Thompson: Correct. And so, if you were to imagine that you had set of platforms in the VAB that extended out to give you access to the shuttle --  (Launch Control Center page is heard in the background)  Host: And we’ll point out, well, that you've mentioned a couple of times, being in the launch facility, that's where you're actually right now, while we're talking, and that's that sound, we're hearing.  Charlie Blackwell-Thompson: Yes, it is.  Host: So, we were talking -- you were talking about the facilities inside the VAB that were there specifically for space shuttle, which I guess, you're going to say are things that you don't need now.  Charlie Blackwell-Thompson: Right. And so, the access to the vehicle is really different and so, the platforms that are over in the Vehicle Assembly Building that were there in the shuttle era have all been removed, but they've been replaced with new access platforms because the needs and the requirements are very different based on the outer mold line shape of the vehicle, and so, there's been quite a few changes over in the Vehicle Assembly Building, in the platform set that's available, in the services that you provide to the rocket itself and the spacecraft, and to those interface points with which they are provided, so quite a few changes over there. One of the other fairly significant changes is that -- is the mobile launcher itself. The mobile launcher serves as our launch platform.  Host: Right.  Charlie Blackwell-Thompson: We utilize it in the VAB. It also serves as an interface point to the vehicle for critical services, and it rolls, you know, we roll it to the pad, and it remains with the vehicle for launch. So, some fairly significant changes in the Vehicle Assembly Building. Likewise, out at the pad, you may recall that during Apollo and shuttle, we had a lot of service structure that was in place there and that's been --  Host: Oh, yeah.  Charlie Blackwell-Thompson: -- that's been removed. We have a clean pad concept that allows for reduced operations and maintenance cost over the long term. You know, our launch facility sits on the beach and so, it's exposed, and so we've found over time that the clean pad concept reduces those costs and so, helps with those operations and maintenance areas and so, we have a clean pad, so it looks really different than Launch Complex 39B looked during the shuttle era.  Host: You mean less hardware out there that's exposed to the elements.  Charlie Blackwell-Thompson: Absolutely, absolutely.  Host: And that doesn't -- so it's -- there's less out there to be degraded by them or to have to undergo costly repair.  Charlie Blackwell-Thompson: Correct.  Host: OK.  Charlie Blackwell-Thompson: Correct.  Host: OK.  Charlie Blackwell-Thompson: And so, there's been a lot of changes and then certainly, last but not least is our crawler-transporter, you know?  Host: Yeah.  Charlie Blackwell-Thompson: It's been in service for a very long time. We used it during Apollo, we used it during shuttle, and we intend to use it during Artemis, but it has gone through some upgrades to prepare it for the increased weight of this vehicle, and we have certainly utilized it several times as we have rolled the mobile launcher out to the pad for various verification and validation testing that we've done over the last year or two. So, all of our GSE, some of it is brand new because it supports the unique requirements of the vehicle, but some of the infrastructure and maybe big pieces of hardware that folks would be familiar with back from the shuttle program, they're still in service. They've just been given a bit of an overhaul.  Host: And GSE, is that Ground Support something?  Charlie Blackwell-Thompson: Equipment, yes.  Host: GSE.  Charlie Blackwell-Thompson: Ground Support Equipment.  Host: I got you. Cool. And Charlie, you are the launch director in Exploration Ground Systems. You're going to be the launch director for the first flight, for Artemis I. Tell me what the job means? What does it entail?  Charlie Blackwell-Thompson: Well, the first thing it means to me is that I'm really lucky, right?  Host: Yeah.  Charlie Blackwell-Thompson: Really lucky to have this amazing opportunity and to work with such an incredible group of people. You know, firsts don't come along that often and to be at the beginning of a program that is going to take the first woman and the next man back to the Moon is pretty special. It's pretty special to me. The responsibilities of the launch director is to make sure in the planning phase that we have the products, the services, the capabilities and our team is ready for launch, and those are pretty, pretty broad descriptions, but when I talk about things like products, it's the launch countdown procedure, it's developing the, you know, the steps, the -- very specific steps that we will go through within our launch countdown for configuring the ground equipment, configuring the flight vehicle, checking it out.  Host: The instruction manual, it tells you how to --  Charlie Blackwell-Thompson: The -- it is. It is the instruction manual, and so, we have to go put that together. We have to establish the timelines. I mean, we are working toward a launch window that opens and we want to be ready when that launch window opens, and so we also want to make sure that our timelines are put together and that we measure ourselves against those timelines as we go through launch because we have some areas where we can catch up, but we also have some areas for what we call critical path which is, you know, we really need to do these things in a very specific order, in a very specific timeline, and so, it's putting that timeline together. It's also the development of our launch commit criteria, which is the rules with which we are go or no-go on launch day and so, those are the things, and I talk about products, those are some of the specific things that I'm talking about.  Host: Right.  Charlie Blackwell-Thompson: When I speak about capabilities, it's ensuring that our capabilities are in line with our day of launch needs, and capabilities, again, is another really broad category, but it's things like, you know, the nets that we talk on, right? We have to be able to talk to our team across a number of different channels, have to be able to talk to the flight control team that's back at Johnson (Space Center), have to be able to talk to the engineering design centers and so, it's ensuring that we have all of that capability in place for launch day. It's sometimes a simple -- and that's a pretty complex capability.  Host: Yeah.  Charlie Blackwell-Thompson: It's some simple capabilities, too, which are, you know, what are the platforms that we're running our electronic procedures on? And do they allow us to very, you know, easily work our way through the steps and buy them off and for our team to have visibility to that? So, it -- capabilities is a pretty big bucket that there's a lot of different things in that, but it's ensuring that all that we need on launch day is in place and is working for us.  Host: It sounds like it's not just strictly any communications capabilities, but any sorts of systems that support the work that all of these people who are working the launch need in order to succeed, to complete that job.  Charlie Blackwell-Thompson: Absolutely. And then, there's the team piece, of course, which is, you know, is our team ready? So, you know, do we have our products in place? Do we have our software done? Do we have our procedures ready? But it's also, is our team ready? And so, we have a suite of training that we do with our team to ensure, we do simulations, very similar to what the flight control team does except ours are very focused on the prelaunch phase, but we will go through our operations a number of times with our launch team to ensure that we're ready for our nominal launch countdown and we're also ready for any problems that may arise on launch day and that we have the right, what we call preplanned contingencies in place, but it's really a “what's our plan?” if this happens? How do we go --  Host: If something goes wrong.  Charlie Blackwell-Thompson: -- work through it?  Host: Yeah. What are we going to do if something goes wrong?  Charlie Blackwell-Thompson: Yes.  Host: Mm-hm.  Charlie Blackwell-Thompson: And can we get ourselves to a go or no-go state? Are we done for the day when this problem arises or do we have some things we can go do, some redundancy we can employ, some additional capability, that allows us to go fly the vehicle?  Host: It sounds like you're talking about education. You're teaching everybody who's a member of that team to know everything about their particular area of expertise and then, how everyone would work together to respond to something that was unexpected.  Charlie Blackwell-Thompson: Absolutely. You know, we're teaching each other.  Host: Yeah.  Charlie Blackwell-Thompson: We're all learning together as part of those simulations and those training exercises.  Host: Being the launch director responsible for the development of all of that sounds like a heck of a big responsibility. Tell me about how you got yourself ready to take that up. Tell me about your background, what was your professional path that got you here?  Charlie Blackwell-Thompson: Absolutely. I'm happy to share that. So, I came to Kennedy Space Center as a senior in college. I was lucky enough to get an interview with one of the contractors here at KSC that was responsible for the processing of payload flight hardware.  And when I was in school -- I have an engineering, I'm a computer engineering major -- and one of the areas that I was interested in, in school was software. I didn't want to write code. I knew that that was not my thing --  Host: Right.  Charlie Blackwell-Thompson: -- but I was interested in testing it and in doing verification and validation and so, I was lucky enough that in one of my interviews, I had mentioned that I wanted to do the software testing and one of the contractors was looking for someone that was interested in doing software testing and so, I got a call back and they brought me here to Kennedy Space Center and absolute, you know, thrill to be here --  Host: Yeah.  Charlie Blackwell-Thompson: -- to be able to see the space shuttle orbiter, but when I walked in -- and it's not lost on me that it was Firing Room 1, which by the way, is where we're going to launch from --  Host: Right.  Charlie Blackwell-Thompson: -- but when I walked in Firing Room 1, the team was preparing space shuttle Discovery for Return to Flight after Challenger --  Host: Oh.  Charlie Blackwell-Thompson: -- and I was just struck by the work that they were doing. I wanted to be a part of that team. I wanted to earn myself a seat in the room, and I was lucky enough over time, to do that, and so, I started. I was working in software and I did that for a couple years. I moved up to work on not just payload flight software but to work on avionic systems on payloads that were flying in the space shuttle, so I got to work on them offline in their avionics integration and tests and then I got to come when they were installed in the space shuttle, I got to come and check out the communications and the avionics interface between --  Host: Cool.  Charlie Blackwell-Thompson: -- the payload systems and the orbiter systems.  Host: You got to put your hands on the space shuttle.  Charlie Blackwell-Thompson: I did, and I also got to put my hands on the payload flight hardware, so I got an opportunity over the course of my career -- I can't really believe how incredibly blessed I've been -- I got to work on Hubble Space Telescope.  Host: Oh.  Charlie Blackwell-Thompson: I got to work on the servicing missions that followed --  Host: Uh-huh.  Charlie Blackwell-Thompson: -- the International Space Station assembly elements, some awesome observatories, Gamma Ray Observatory, some planetary missions, so just really had -- and you know, each of them were different so, it was always something to go learn.  Host: Nice.  Charlie Blackwell-Thompson: And after I did that for about 15 years, I had an opportunity to move over to NASA in the civil servant workforce and become a test director, and I took that opportunity and that was a huge change from working in payloads and working in command and data handling and electrical systems, and moving over to the test director office, but it was a great opportunity for me to learn to kind of look more broadly across shuttle processing, and so I did that until the shuttle program ended. I became a certified -- a launch-certified NASA test director so I had an opportunity to launch from that position, a number of times, and stayed either in the NTD role or the chief NTD role, which is NASA test director, or the assistant launch director role, until the end of the program.  So had a lot of time in the Firing Room. After shuttle ended, I led a division within the ground processing directorate and that was a lot of really good work, gave me a lot of new skills, but I was always called back to that Firing Room and always called back to the flight hardware and so, a few years ago back in 2016 I got an opportunity to start helping. or I guess in 2015, start helping with the launch planning for the Artemis vehicle, and so here I am.  Host: There you are. Do you have any good sense yet, and granted, you haven't actually launched an Artemis mission, but as you're getting ready for it, do you have a sense of whether being the Artemis launch director is significantly different than being the launch director for other kinds of rockets or missions that launch at Kennedy Space Center?  Charlie Blackwell-Thompson: I would say that the role is -- because I had a firsthand view, although I did -- I wasn't a launch director in shuttle.  Host: Right.  Charlie Blackwell-Thompson: I was an assistant launch director, but I had a firsthand view of what the shuttle launch director did, and so, I would say, it's similar, not quite the same, but if I were to pick most similarity I would say it's very similar to the role of the shuttle launch director.  Host: OK. A few minutes ago you were, started going through some of the process of what the Artemis launch director preparing for the first mission, the kinds of things that you've had to do. You're talking -- are there -- were there other changes on ground systems that we hadn't gotten to yet? Are there other things than, besides the VAB and the crawler-transporter, big changes that you've made?  Charlie Blackwell-Thompson: I would say those are the, probably the biggest is that, you know, we have mobile launcher that provides those critical services. I didn't talk a whole lot about that. That was repurposed from the Constellation program. The biggest, most visible changes are in the VAB, out at the pad, and I would say in the Launch Control Center, but certainly --  Host: Yeah.  Charlie Blackwell-Thompson: -- across the center, there are changes within each of those major facilities that are very unique to support to this vehicle. I mean, new, when I talk about ground support equipment, there is a suite of ground support equipment that has been either upgraded, changed, enhanced to support the needs of this vehicle, and when I talk about that it's everything from, you know, the purges on the vehicle to, you know, the software in which we control certain functions. It's just across the board, really significant changes because the needs of this vehicle are quite different than what we had back in shuttle, and even in the cases where it may be similar, you know, some of the equipment from shuttle had been around for a really long time and was really in need of upgrade, either for obsolescence reasons --  Host: Right.  Charlie Blackwell-Thompson: -- or just, you know, maintainability reasons.  Host: You're developing a system that is specific to the needs of the rocket that you're launching, the rocket and the spacecraft that you're launching. By the way, is the Artemis I launch director much involved in the development of the rocket and the spacecraft itself?  Charlie Blackwell-Thompson: Well, I would say that our sister programs SLS and Orion are responsible for the development of the rocket and the spacecraft. Where the launch director comes in is when we begin to talk about the launch operations and kind of keeping the end in mind. It's in that requirements development piece, I would say. It's in formulating some of the capabilities that we need, so we are involved. It's not our direct responsibility but --  Host: Right.  Charlie Blackwell-Thompson: -- certainly, when we think about launching the vehicle, we, you know, we have to think about well, what do we need and what is the timeline in which we need to do this? And so, we are involved in those design discussions and decisions, you know, from a making an input for -- maybe it's for operability. Hey, for launch, you know, if we could do it this way, this would be a great help to us because we are constrained, you know, by either the timeline or maybe by other work, so it's really important to be a part of those discussions in the development phase because elsewise, you know, you get it and then you kind of got to make do with what you have in terms of this is what the work takes. So, it's really a partnership between the operations team and the development team, you know? The development team's responsible for developing the flight hardware, but the operations team is, you know, is invested in providing the inputs of this makes it much easier for us on the ground in the prelaunch phase or in the launch phase, if we do, you know, solution A versus solution B.  Host: You don't want them to develop a system that is hard to operate.  Charlie Blackwell-Thompson: Correct.  Host: Yeah. The first flight of Artemis, the first Artemis flight, or the next flight, is not going to have any astronauts onboard, so are there significant developments in, or differences, in developing procedures for a flight with no astronauts as opposed to the subsequent flights, which all will have people onboard?  Charlie Blackwell-Thompson: That's a great question. There are differences. The great thing is, you know, we expect to get a really solid baseline from Artemis I on what it takes to configure the ground, what it takes to configure the SLS rocket, the upper stage, and Orion to some degree, from Artemis I, and once we write those procedures, I'm a big fan of we write it once, we use it many times, because once you write it and you use it and you iterate on it, it's kind of working from a proven product and so, to me, that's the great thing about utilizing our launch countdown procedures between Artemis I and Artemis II, but there are absolutely differences. The most notable, of course, is when we close out the crew module, so for when we have crew, just like you see for some of the other vehicles and we saw in shuttle, is that after, in the later part of our countdown, for us in Artemis after we get finished with our tanking phase, you know, the crew will go to the pad. We'll have crew ingress and then we will go through our crew module close out where we do comm[unication] checks with the crew, we finish out our work in the crew module and we begin backing out, closing the hatch and then leaving the pad in preparation for launch. On Artemis I, we don't have that work to do and so, we're all about, you know, buying down schedule risk and technical risk as we go, so we can close that crew module out before we ever tank the vehicle and so we'll do that on Artemis I. So, that would be the biggest change between Artemis I and II is that you won't see that activity post-tanking for Artemis I. We'll have the crew module buttoned up, we will have closed out the White Room, we'll have closed the hatch before we ever leave the pad for tanking on Artemis I, so that'll be a big difference for Artemis II, and it will certainly add some time into our timeline as well.  Host: Or there's less things to do so the timeline will be a bit shorter.   Charlie Blackwell-Thompson: For Artemis I, that is correct.  Host: Yeah. Let's talk more about Artemis I. Tell me -- I referred to the fact that there'll be no people onboard, but you tell me, what are the objectives of this first flight in the Artemis program?  Charlie Blackwell-Thompson: So, the objectives of Artemis I is we're building a capability, right? We're building a capability to send people back to the Moon, and so Artemis I is about testing out some of those capabilities that we need before we send crew into space, and one of the primary capabilities that we're testing out is the integrated vehicle, and the performance and the capabilities of it, because it'll be the first time that we have launched the SLS rocket with the upper stage, with the Orion spacecraft and --  Host: Right.  Charlie Blackwell-Thompson: -- so we'll be testing out that capability. The other piece is the Orion heat shield and how it performs as we go through re-entry, and so I know that my flight director friends will probably talk to you more about that when you talk to them, but those are two of the big objectives as part of Artemis I, and then there's some other objectives related to some payload activities, and then of course the recovery of the Orion spacecraft at the end of the mission. So, it's, in the simplest of terms for Artemis I, it's about testing out critical capability that we will then, once we know that that critical capability is in place and is sound, we'll be ready to put crew on Artemis II, and then, certainly, sending the crew into deep space and checking out the capability there of the spacecraft and how it all performs with the crew interface and the additional systems there and then getting ready for Artemis III and boots on the Moon, so it's an incremental approach for how we build this capability toward returning to the Moon.  Host: Is the launch director particularly interested in what happens after you get it off the ground?  Charlie Blackwell-Thompson: Oh, I absolutely am.  Host: That's not your responsibility anymore, right?  Charlie Blackwell-Thompson: It is at liftoff, at booster ignition and liftoff, the launch director hands off to the ascent flight director.  Host: Right.  Charlie Blackwell-Thompson: And so, from a -- are you directly involved? The answer's no, I'm not. Am I interested? Absolutely, because we're all stakeholders in this and, you know, it really is in some ways like you're handing the baton to your partner and --  Host: Relay, yeah.  Charlie Blackwell-Thompson: -- you know, you want to hand them the best vehicle, the most capable vehicle that you can, and likewise my flight director friends want to hand that, you know, that vehicle back to the landing recovery director at the end and so, we are all partners in this together and, you know, certainly like the nation will be, I will be watching with intrigue and wonder --  Host: Oh, yeah.  Charlie Blackwell-Thompson: -- as we go through the different phases of the mission.  Host: Help us, all the rest of us who don't know yet, help us understand what happens leading up to that launch. Pick some point at, you know, a launch minus however far you want it to be, and give me the story of what's going to happen there around the Kennedy Space Center and what sorts of events and milestones are going to happen as your team gets this vehicle ready to fly?  Charlie Blackwell-Thompson: Well, so let's see. I could start at any point, I would say and --  Host: Pick one.  Charlie Blackwell-Thompson: -- in terms of -- I'm going to say, let's talk about, maybe in the -- I'll talk about some visible pieces in a moment, but if I were to say, step back, you know, a year, maybe --  Host: OK.  Charlie Blackwell-Thompson: -- a year-ish, what are the things that we're doing here to get ready for launch? Well, some of it I talked about already, but it's the -- it's in development, it's receiving the requirements from our flight element sister programs that say here is the services, here are the needs of this vehicle. And so, it is developing the procedures, it's developing the software, it's developing everything that we need to put these flight elements together and to test them out to ensure that they're ready to go fly, and that's not a small undertaking. That's --  Host: No.  Charlie Blackwell-Thompson: -- a fairly significant development effort in terms of the procedures and the software, and of course, you have to -- you, even if I were to back up before that, before you get the flight hardware, you know, over the last many years, we have been developing these capabilities here at Kennedy Space Center for, to support the vehicle, and it's sometimes it's things that you may not think about. I'll give an example.  Host: OK.  Charlie Blackwell-Thompson: We have out at the pad at launch, and you've probably seen this in the past, but at T-zero, or in and around T-zero, during the ascent phase, very close to being off the pad, right, there's an acoustic environment that is created by the booster ignition and there's a big sound wave that kind of bounces off of the deck, if you will, of the mobile launcher, and one of the very simple ways that we mitigate that to create any adverse effects of the vehicle is that we flood the deck with water.  Host: Right.  Charlie Blackwell-Thompson: Now that sounds pretty simple, but there's actually a pretty specific timing sequence to that and when you want to have that deck flooded with water. If you flood it too soon, the water will have, you know, will have run off the sides and down --  Host: It'll be gone.  Charlie Blackwell-Thompson: -- through the flame trench and you won't really have the covering that you need, and so while that sounds simple and easy, it requires testing and so, we have spent some amount of time kind of tuning, if you will, the start of the water and kind of the timing of it because we want to have it just right, and while that sounds pretty simple it turns out to be a number of different tests, you know, to get it exactly where you want it relative to T-zero, and so, there are many, many tests, many development efforts like that, that have been ongoing for many years. We are glad to be working our way through those and get them behind us because we're excited about this flight hardware coming to Kennedy Space Center.  Host: I can imagine that it's kind of the, you know, the more I learn, the more I realize I don't know, and you got to work through those steps in order to figure out when is the right time to turn on the water and how much and from what directions, just as an example of the kinds of procedures that you've got to develop, even if just by trial and error.  Charlie Blackwell-Thompson: Correct, correct. And so, there's all of that work that happens, I would say, you know, years before and probably not nearly as visible. The same thing is true with the software in the Launch Control Center. I mean, developing a new suite of software for a brand new vehicle while you're building the flight hardware at the same time, you know, comes with some challenges, and so, you know, we've been developing that software, we're just about to the finish line on it and so, you know, but that's one of those things that kind of happens that is maybe not as visible, but starts many years before, but kind of bringing it back to what are the visible pieces that'll be maybe here more in the near term --  Host: OK.  Charlie Blackwell-Thompson: -- is a couple things. First, the core stage is due to arrive here very soon. They have finished up their Green Run testing. It was hugely successful. Our team was in Firing Room 1 following along during that testing activity.  Host: Uh uh.  Charlie Blackwell-Thompson: It was amazing to see that stage run the full duration, to see those engines light and gimbal and just run through that full duration run with something incredibly special. And for me, when that test was over and they were in post-cutoff safing, I couldn't help but think, you know, the next time those engines light, it's launch day.  Host: Mhhm.  Charlie Blackwell-Thompson: So --  Host: No more test firings of them until then?  Charlie Blackwell-Thompson: What's that?  Host: There's no more testing of them until then?  Charlie Blackwell-Thompson: There's testing of the engines, but there's no more firing --  Host: Firing of them.  Charlie Blackwell-Thompson: -- of them.  Host: OK. Good. I didn't realize that. That's – yeah, that's interesting to think about.  Charlie Blackwell-Thompson: Yeah. As a launch director, I often have -- I've looked at things with a lens toward launch and so it's not uncommon for, you know, for me to when I think about different milestones, I had the same thought during hot fire and during the wet dress activities, you know, when I was thinking about, you know, the next time we tank this vehicle it's wet dress day, and the time we tank it after that is launch day, and so we are, you know, we're really one tanking away from launch day.  Host: And if I can, when you refer to wet dress, that's another step in the preparation of a test run of a sort.  Charlie Blackwell-Thompson: It is and that's one of those -- when we talk about big milestones, I talked about core stage getting here, which is the last piece of flight hardware for the Artemis vehicle. It'll be the final piece, so everything else is here at Kennedy --  Host: Already there.  Charlie Blackwell-Thompson: -- Space Center. Yup. And everything is in process, either in testing or in preparation phase, so when the core stage gets here very soon that'll be -- that's a big deal for us, and then after it gets here, maybe not quite as visible milestones will be the integration of the hardware and the testing that follows in the VAB. I mean, all very important tests, right, we begin to put, the boosters are stacked up in the VAB right now and just waiting and so, the core stage will come, will get integrated with the boosters, the upper stage will get integrated up on top and then Orion up on top of that, and there's a series of tests that we do -- prior to rollout for wet dress rehearsal, but wet dress rehearsal and the rollout for it, I think will be a really big and very visible milestone for us as --  Host: Yeah.  Charlie Blackwell-Thompson: -- an enterprise, because it means that the vehicle's been fully integrated, the vehicle has been fully tested in the Vehicle Assembly Building, and we are ready to roll to the pad for wet dress rehearsal, and what wet dress rehearsal is, is a wet dress rehearsal for launch.  Host: OK.  Charlie Blackwell-Thompson: So, we will --  Host: And wet, that's wet as opposed to dry and I'm taking that that has to do with fuel.  Charlie Blackwell-Thompson: It does.  Host: OK.  Charlie Blackwell-Thompson: So, we will go through the loading profile for both core stage and upper stage, so we will tank the vehicle. We will go through the launch countdown operations, down to terminal count, and then we will have a planned cutoff. So, we will go down to about ten seconds in the countdown and then we'll call it a day, but it will be an opportunity to go in a wet environment to do a dress rehearsal for launch.  Host: OK. As you -- as we -- you get to -- I'm thinking ahead to the actual flight, I guess, you know, the excitement. [Laughter] You want to think about that, but you said a moment ago that as the launch director, you actually hand off responsibility for the vehicle fairly soon after it gets off the ground. Are there any other responsibilities that your team has then all the way to the completion of the mission, or is that all the responsibility of the flight control teams?  Charlie Blackwell-Thompson: It is the resp -- the flight phase is the responsibility of the flight control team. Now we are there to support them --  Host: Mm-hm.  Charlie Blackwell-Thompson: -- because sometimes there are questions about, you know, did you see this on the ground or, you know, what did you guys observe during testing? And so, we are part of the Mission Management Team meetings that happen on a daily basis and so, we are absolutely there to support our flight control teammates, but in terms of the responsibility for the vehicle, it resides with them.  Host: Does Exploration Ground Systems then come back into play on any given mission once the vehicle returns, once the Orion returns?  Charlie Blackwell-Thompson: It absolutely does and it's actually, there's a handoff at the end of the mission, so the flight control team is responsible for the landing operations, but the recovery director, who is Exploration Ground Systems, and that's Melissa Jones, she is responsible for the recovery of the spacecraft and the preparation of it to return here to Kennedy after the mission is done, and so, Melissa will have a team of folks that will be ready to make those recovery operations, and I think she's -- you're also planning to talk to her a little bit about that -- but absolutely, so we're kind of on the front end of the mission getting ready for launch and then on the back end of the mission as we recover the spacecraft and bring it back here to Kennedy for processing and making ready for any future needs.  Host: So, as we look ahead through this year toward, you know, as we get closer to when Artemis I is going to happen, what kind of milestones would you maybe advise people to keep an eye out for? What big things are going to happen between now and then, that are sending the message that we're getting closer, this is still happening, and we're actually making progress here?  Charlie Blackwell-Thompson: Well, I think the milestone of core stage arriving here at Kennedy is a significant milestone for us because it means, not just to us, but to everyone that is watching that all of the flight hardware has arrived here. It is here at the launch site, and now it is in the final preparations for launch. Likewise, I think once the testing is done, I think that rollout for launch, a very visible milestone, is going to be an amazing sight when that vehicle rolls out of the Vehicle Assembly Building High Bay 3.  Host: And make sure that it doesn't bump its head out on the way out, too.  Charlie Blackwell-Thompson: It is a -- it's a really tall vehicle and I have watched a number of rollouts. You know, as the launch director you are responsible for directing the team and leading the team during those roll operations and I've seen a number of vehicles roll past the windows of the LCC on their way to the pad --  Host: Yeah.  Charlie Blackwell-Thompson: -- and I can't wait to see this one for the first time, because it is going to be something incredibly special. I've been around a long time and it's something I'm really looking forward to because I think it's going to be something that I haven't seen before, and many haven't seen before in terms of just how stately this vehicle is going to look when it comes through those doors.  Host: It's also got a terrific, symbolic importance because of where it's going and what it's going to do.  Charlie Blackwell-Thompson: Absolutely.  Host: Charlie Blackwell-Thompson, thank you so much for helping us understand better what's going on at the Kennedy Space Center and what we'll see when it comes time for Artemis to fly.  Charlie Blackwell-Thompson: You're welcome. It's been my pleasure to be here today. I hope you got a sense that this an incredible vehicle. It's got an incredible mission. We're excited here at Kennedy and, you know, I feel just extremely blessed to be a part of this, so thank you for letting me be a part of your afternoon.  [Music]  Host: Things are coming together more and more as the calendar moves closer and closer to the next launch for Project Artemis. Not happening as fast as some people would like, of course, but you can hear from the launch director that the folks on the ground are seeing progress and getting through the series of tests and in processing and assembly.

                        "description": "Gary Jordan (Host): Houston, we have a podcast! Welcome to the official podcast of the NASA Johnson Space Center, Episode 204, “Women in STEM.” I'm Gary Jordan. And I'll be your host today. On this show, we bring in the experts, sometimes we bring in the folks who will become the experts. On this episode we're bringing in women interns to describe their unique paths from what sparked their interest in different science, technology, engineering or math fields, or STEM fields, to working at NASA. Joining me is Sophia Hahn from Armstrong Flight Research Center in California, Shelita Hall, who joins us at the Johnson Space Center here in Houston, and Emily Anderson from the Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland. There are many ways to find a passion in a STEM field and find a job doing what you love. Here are just a few of the women who pursued this dream and ended up at NASA. Enjoy.  [ Music]  Host: Sophia, Shelita and Emily, thank you all so much for coming on Houston We Have a Podcast. I'm very excited to get into this conversation. It's all about the unique paths. And it's interesting, because each of you have a different way of getting to NASA. You all are in different majors. And you all specialize in different things. And then best of all, you're all in three different locations right now, working at three different centers. So, this is going to be really cool to jump into it. So, I want to go through each of you one at a time, so all of our listeners can get used to your voices. Sophia, I'm going to start with you. Tell me about your major, and where you're working, and what you've, what you’ve been doing lately.  Sophia Hahn: Sure. So, I am Sophia Hahn, I should start with that and I am currently a bachelor's student going for an aerospace engineering degree at San Jose State University. This is my junior year for -- to kind of give a rough estimate. I was a transfer student and I attended Sacramento City Community College before I transferred to San Jose State University. For me, I am working on the Prandtl-M (Preliminary Research Aerodynamic Design to Land on Mars) project. It's a very long acronym. So, what it basically boils down to is we are working on making a glider that will fly on Mars. And we are using some experimental lifting line theories, and some kind of more experimental aerodynamics that hopefully make it work.  Host: OK, that is awesome. I'm definitely going to get into more about that a little bit later, but I wonder, Sophia, do you have something that inspired you to go into aerospace? Why was that something that was attractive to you?  Sophia Hahn: Yeah. For me, I've been very fortunate throughout my life to have kind of grown up in the aerospace industry.  Host: Oh, cool.  Sophia Hahn: My grandfather was in the Air Force, both of my parents are pilots. So, I have strong memories as a child of going around with my grandpa and my dad to various aviation museums throughout the country and looking at all the different planes. And particularly being quite fond of the SR-71 Blackbird. So, for me, heading into the aerospace or aviation industry was kind of a natural thing for me, having just grown up in that environment. I've always just loved planes. I love the stars. I used to look at telescopes with my grandpa, and kind of look at the various stars in the sky. And I recently, about two years ago, got my private pilot's certificate, which is basically like a pilot's license, like an intro-level pilot's license, for those who aren't familiar with the term. So, yeah, so, for me, aviation has just always been there. And I've always loved it.  Host: Very lucky for sure. That's awesome to be --  Sophia Hahn: Yeah.  Host: -- surrounded by, by so many cool people in your life and be inspired by that. So that's awesome. You ended up in the right, right place for sure. So, Shelita, I want to go to you next. You are, let's see, you're more material science and engineering. Tell us a little bit about yourself, and your background.  Shelita Hall: Awesome. Yeah. So, I just received my bachelor's in chemistry last May of 2020. And I immediately went into the Ph.D. program at Norfolk State University for material science and engineering. And so, yeah, it's been an awesome journey so far. I started at Langley in January 2020 with the Chief Technologist of NASA LaRC (Langley Research Center) Headquarters. And I stayed with Julie Williams-Byrd for about six months. I worked with her for the spring and the summer. Then I ended up transitioning over to the Advanced Materials and Processing Branch at LaRC as well. And I started to get experience with radiation transport and computational analysis. And then, I went over to Glenn for this past spring. And I worked on radiation transport as well for thermal electric materials, so that we will, we can protect our power generators, you know, for spacecraft, because they are, they are ultimately exposed to radiation. And so, it will degrade the spacecraft. But my ultimate, ultimate Ph.D. work is based off of studying the neural networks, so that we can know what happens to the brain upon radiation exposure. So, that we can keep our astronauts safe and, you know, create the correct spacesuits in order to shield or absorb the radiation, you know, that's going on in space. So, that we can, you know, make sure they're safe from the long-term mission.  Host: See, that is super cool, but it seems like, Shelita, you made your rounds all around NASA. This is something that maybe, was there something earlier in your life that you're thinking, \"oh, I want to, if I get into NASA, I want to, I want to make the most out of it.\" Was there an early inspiration for you for coming to NASA? Shelita Hall: Yeah. Like I was always interested in working at NASA, but I never thought it would actually happen. And so, like when I was exposed to the Space Medicine Program at Norfolk State, that's when it actually, you know, became, became a reality for me. I was like, \"wow, now I have the opportunity to actually contribute to NASA missions.\" And, you know, I just give thanks to Norfolk State for having that program for students. And that's kind of how everything started for me. And so, once I found out about that, I wanted to kind of see if I can apply for an internship. And then once I got it, I was like, \"oh, my God, this is so cool!” So, I have been enjoying it ever since.  Host: Very cool. And now you're at the Johnson Space Center. Right?  Shelita Hall: I am, yes.  Host: Cool. What are you doing here?  Shelita Hall: So, I am actually in the Human Research Program. My mentor is Dr. Robin Elgart. And so, basically, I am doing a project management kind of project, where I am kind of collecting all of the tissue archives from all of the different institutions around the U.S. who participate in space medicine research. So, we're trying to kind of organize a database, where the different institutions can just go on the database, and find different tissues for space medicine research, and just kind of an organized platform for like tissue archives; just to keep everything organized. And it's kind of helping me with getting used to like animal research in general. And so, it's just a very, a very exciting project. I get to kind of be in the background of how like project management kind of works at NASA, and sort of kind of be doing like the research and stuff. So, I'm just trying to have an overall, you know, an overall experience. So, you know, to try to, you know, get my feet wet in different, different projects. So, it's very exciting.  Host: Very awesome. Well, welcome, and glad to have you, Shelita.  Shelita Hall: Thank you.  Host: And, Emily, you are the last guest from Goddard Space Flight Center in software engineering. Tell us more about yourself.  Emily Anderson: Yeah, yeah. Thank you so much for having me, first of all. I'm really, really excited to be here, but, yeah, my name is Emily Anderson. And I just finished up my third year studying software engineering at Iowa State University in Ames, Iowa. And I interned at Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland. And I was an OSTEM intern. And so, during my internship, I worked on NASA's core Flight System, which is the reusable software framework that a lot of different missions are able to utilize. And that's the cool part about it is that it's just so reusable and so can be adapted to a bunch of different missions. And things as small as a CubeSat can use this framework, and things as big as the Artemis mission can use it. So super, super interesting. Super cool. And, specifically, what I did is I made some code changes, and did some modifications and testing, in order to raise the classification level of the code for the Lunar Gateway mission.  Host: Very cool. So, software engineering, that's an interesting path. What, what inspired you to take that as a major?  Emily Anderson: Yeah, so I actually started off as an aerospace engineering major and during my first aerospace class, we were given a task to build this aircraft. And our aircraft had two propellers on the sides. And the two props on the sides were connected to a joystick. In order to program the joystick to the props on the side, we had to write maybe like 20 lines of Python I think, in order to get that to work. And when we did this with Python, and we did this coding, I just absolutely fell in love with coding and software engineering. And that's when I decided to change my major over to that instead.  Host: Pursue what you love. That's a, that’s a pretty good course of action to take.  Emily Anderson: Yes, definitely.  Host: Very good. So, Emily, you grew up in more in a rural area. Right? So how, how did you think about, you know, tell me about the environment that you, surrounded you? And then how that directed a path to a science, technology, engineering and math field?  Emily Anderson: Yeah. So, my school I grew up, we had about 40 people in my graduating class. And my high school didn't have too much to offer in terms of engineering courses and STEM courses. And I grew up on a farm. So, there was actually a lot of agriculture around. And so, going off to college, I really wasn't quite sure what I wanted to study. And so, before I decided on aerospace, I was actually doing law. And that just wasn't the path for me, I decided. So, then I switched up a bit. And so, after I decided to switch to software engineering, I had never looked at code before. I'd never really, I didn't really know what programming was. And so, I was a little scared and a little nervous at first. My major is about 90% male and 10% female. So, I was a bit overwhelmed, but after taking my first programming course, and just deciding to pursue what I loved, I was able to succeed. And I think it's just important to note that, even if you don't come from a background and a high school with a bunch of engineering courses, and you have this huge background, exhaustive background with robotics and engineering, and all these different things, that you're still able to succeed in the STEM field.  Host: Very cool. And it seemed like you were, you were part of definitely a minority right there. Right? So only 10% of the people in your, in your field were women. So, tell me about that. Like with such a low population, you know, what, what kept you driving? What kept you going that says, \"you know what, I don't really care if not a lot of people look like me. I'm passionate about this. And I want to pursue this.”  Emily Anderson: Yeah, I think just having female role models is so, so important. At my first internship, I was exposed to these female trailblazers. And even in my time at NASA, my mentor did a fantastic job. She, she ran meetings. And she had so many amazing contributions to NASA's core Flight System. And just having great examples of that were able to really, really inspire me to continue on, and try to beat that, and help improve those numbers. And, hopefully, get the female population in my major up to 50% one day.  Host: Very cool. Well, Emily, I'm glad to have you as well. And for all three of you, I want to stick with this theme of inspiring to, to enter into the fields that you did. I think it's a, I think it’s a really good topic to help to kick us off. Shelita, I want to, I want to go back to you for a second. You were talking about some super interesting stuff. Particularly, now, you're looking at radiation in astronauts. It seems like your, your field is just a mix of a bunch of different things. You've got material science, you've got engineering, you've got some biology in there, some human science. So, so what, for you, what was it that made you want to pursue something like that, but then have such a round -- approach to everything? So how did you get started there?  Shelita Hall: Yeah. Well, when I first majored in chemistry, my goal was to actually go with the medicine. I wanted to see if I could apply to medical school. And so, that didn't work out. And so, I was like, \"well, maybe I should just try engineering.\" And then when I was looking into the Ph.D. program for materials engineering, I saw that there was a space medicine program. And so, it's like the perfect mixture of both medicine and both engineering. And I was just so fascinated by the idea to, you know, do this project, and then contribute to NASA's long-term mission. And so, it was just an awesome and just an awesome program. And I actually kind of started in that laboratory in undergrad. And then kind of just eased into the program when I actually started the Ph.D. program. And so, it was a really cool experience. And I get to be exposed to just the medicine involved with long-term missions, because I also collaborate with the local medical school. And so, they kind of collaborate with Norfolk State and NASA as well. So, it's a very interdisciplinary project. And that's what I love about this field, because you can learn about different things, and you're exposed to so many different people, you know, physicist and doctors. And, you know, it's just a whole like large collaboration and that's what I love about space medicine research.  Host: Very awesome. You know, I think, what I pulled from your story, Shelita, is more like when you were thinking about, \"what do I want to do,\" it really, it sounded like what you had to do was sit down and look. Right? So, look --  Shelita Hall: Yeah.  Host: -- like what – you, you didn't have an idea already. I think a lot of people might think, \"oh, all these people were inspired, you know, from early on, they already knew what they wanted.\" But it sounded like you didn't know what you wanted, but it just sort of came to you in the moment. You were looking, and you imagined yourself in this field. And be like, \"ah, that's something that I would be passionate about.\"  Shelita Hall: Yeah, I mean, it definitely wasn't handed to me. I definitely had to look around, and, you know, measure my options to see, you know, to see what was available. And, you know, I kind of had to ask my professors and say, \"what kind of stuff is going on?\" Because, actually, I didn't know about Norfolk State's space medicine program. I had to kind of just look around and search and ask the professors at Norfolk State and they told me about this awesome program. And no one is really in it right now. We have a couple of students. And so, it's kind of just getting off the ground. And so, it's just a cool experience that I got to get to be kind of the beginners in this project. And that's how I became interested in applying for an internship, but I'm just really happy that I kind of asked around. I knew that I wanted to kind of be in medicine, bioengineering and material science. So, it all kind of worked out when I just kind of just looked around and see what was available. So, I'm just really thankful for that.  Host: Very cool. Now, now Sophia, you had the benefit of being surrounded by all this inspiration. You know, you had people, role models in your life already that you looked up to. And you were thinking, \"this is something that I'm passionate about, have always been passionate about, so that's what I'm going to pursue.\" Moving on from there, what did you do? Because I feel like there's a lot of different paths you can take, if you're interested in flying. You know, why go the engineering route? And then what sorts of organizations, and what activities did you do to build up your skillset to pursue this field?  Sophia Hahn: Yeah. So, yeah, like you were saying, I was really fortunate to have a lot of people kind of around supporting me. I think of it less as role models, and more of support --  Host: Oh, cool.  Sophia Hahn: -- because I grew up in Davis, California, which is very close to Sacramento, California, for those who don't know. But they have a really great FIRST Robotics Team there. So, I spent part of my high school career on that team. And something that especially, always really kind of helped me out, too, with finding my passion for engineering was that team. And finding that, while the mentors were really big and really important in helping me kind of discover passion, these students, for me, and my fellow students, both in leadership and just kind of on the design team that I was on, were really, really impactful. And just kind of were all working together to create these robots that are like 120 pounds and require CNC [inaudible] and routers, and the whole nine yards. Right? And having that kind of, seeing around seeing us both male, female, LGBTQ (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and questioning). Just kind of a really great mix of people, just kind of coming together and being able to work really well together on creating these large robots. That sort of support, for me, kind of like as a collective, I guess, is more of a role model to me than more like a traditional role model sense. So, I got really lucky to have all sorts of people who were just kind of supporting my passion along the way, or helping me find it, and just kind of pushing me for it. I also was really fortunate to go to space camp in Huntsville, Alabama, where there was a similar situation. Again, it was just all the counselors there. And I would say that fellow like people in the program along with me were all just really fun, really engaging. And it was just a really great kind of supportive environment for me. And having those people that are kind of like holding your back and like, \"you've got this, you can totally do this,\" for me, was awesome. So that's why I started actually mentoring a robotics team in the Bay Area to do something similar. And basically, hope that I can help kind of inspire the next generation of high school students. Basically like, \"you can do this. Engineering is totally for you. You are 100% like this program 100% is going to help you with the future. And this is totally something you can pursue.\" So, kind of giving back, I guess, a little bit. But, yeah, for me, I've just gotten really lucky to have support kind of everywhere with the different programs I've joined.  Host: You know, I think luck does really have a lot to do with what you're saying, Sophia. But what I love about your narrative here is it's a little bit different from Emily's. Emily's was talking about finding a female role model. Which I think is one, which I think is a fantastic way to be inspired by and pursue something that you love. But I think what's important about your story is that it's not the only way. Right? So, you don't necessarily, it's not like, \"oh, OK, in order to do this, that's, that’s the path that I've got to take.\" There's a lot of different paths. And one of those is finding a culture that works for you. And it sounds like being surrounded by all these very smart people from very diverse backgrounds was inspiring in and of itself. Not so much that you had a mentor that was guiding you, or ushering you through some sort of path, but entering into this exciting world. I can only imagine if you're in this FIRST Robotics thing, where you have all these people from all over, with all these different kinds of backgrounds, all trying to do the same thing; that could be inspiring just in and of itself. You're like, \"wow, I'm a part of this.\"  Sophia Hahn: Yeah, it 100% is. And over the years, too, FIRST has gotten kind of bigger and bigger, to where it's a very much an international program. And, ironically, there's a team based out of Johnson, Team 118, the Robonauts. If you take like a tour of the facility, you can actually see kind of the corner where they work. But, yeah, it's a very big program, because like you need all sorts of people who are all doing something similar. And it's just that kind of electrifying culture that kind of just really like, you just really want to go for it. It really, you feel like you belong. You know, you can look totally different, or have grown up in a very different environment from someone, let's say. From a team in Alabama, for me, it was really a very different environment than like California. But, still, you have this like great common base, you all love engineering. And you all love robotics and you just have this really great kind of collaborative sense, and this great community that kind of just inspires you to keep going forward.  Host: See, that's so important, but, Emily, I love your, your story about looking out and seeking, and finding different role models. And I think that's a really common one. And I think it's a very powerful way to find something you're passionate about, and then have them usher you through it and guide you in certain ways. Can you talk about some of the role models in your life that helped to get you where you are today?  Emily Anderson: So, at my first internship was at a different aerospace company. And so, I met a few very, very important role models there. And they introduced me to these different organizations, and these different clubs and stuff with very, very inspiring women in them. And so, I was able to attend the Grace Hopper Conference, which is a conference for women in computing and women in STEM. And so, I attended this conference, and they had a role model portal, where you could actually just submit to be a mentor or be a mentee. And so, I added myself into that. And through that, I was able to find amazing role models within the industry. And I would set up these meetings and get inspiration from a woman in the actual industry herself. And there's also things like the Brooke Owens Fellowship, which is for women in STEM and women in aerospace specifically. And that is also just a great way to meet role models. Just even through the application process, and having people review your application, and just meeting different women, and kind of just networking and the importance of networking. I was able to, just even through like LinkedIn, I was able to message the creator of Boom Supersonic, which is a supersonic airplane company right now. And so, I was able to meet up with the lead mechanical engineer on their aircraft, who is a female in STEM. And she is just trailblazing her way through, and super, super interesting.  Host: Very cool. It can be really inspiring to, to have all of these people that tell you about their path. And it's not necessarily -- it's not necessarily about copying their path. Right? But it's definitely about finding their own, but they can definitely give you the nudge that, that you need to get you where you want to go. So, Emily, tell me about that nudge that got you to end up working at NASA.  Emily Anderson: Yeah. So, I think that nudge just really came from speaking to these different women and speaking to these different people in the industry. And from that, I was able to believe in myself, and really get inspired to achieve what I wanted to achieve. I kind of, when I applied to NASA at first, I didn't even really think it was a possibility. Like so many people apply to NASA. And it's such a competitive program. And I was a little nervous at first just even applying. But speaking to these women, and just really believing in myself, I think that reflected in the interview process, and throughout the entire process of applying at NASA. And so, I really think that that's what helped inspire me, and wanted me to get that actual position at NASA.  Host: Very cool. Now, Shelita, what about you? What ended up bringing you to, to NASA? With all the different areas that you were exploring, how'd you end up with NASA?  Shelita Hall: Yeah. So, when I actually, you know, joined the Space Medicine Program at Norfolk State, I was like, \"well, let me just try to actually do an internship at NASA,” so that I can kind of get the experience of radiation transport. And, you know, kind of see if I can just kind of get my feet wet with space medicine research, and what's going on actually on [inaudible]. And so, when I applied, I actually got the position with the chief technologist, but I was actually able to network at LaRC. And I was able to meet different people in the radiation analysis department. And so, that's how I ended up getting my internship position for the fall. And so, I was just doing some computational analysis for radiation. And so, now I'm just kind of using that work and kind of just, you know, using it all for my Ph.D. research. And it's just kind of all coming together with the computational analysis, and then the actual space medicine animal research. And so, it just all kind of comes together beautifully. And, like I said, it's very interdisciplinary. So, I get to meet a lot of different people, and a lot of strong women in the space medicine industry at NASA. Like Emily said, I've also, you know, kind of networked on LinkedIn. And I've just met so many women at NASA who are also conducting the same like kind of research in the space medicine field, at Ames, at Johnson, at LaRC. And they're all just very inspiring to me. And it was just very inspiring to just set up a meeting with them, and just talk to them. And they gave me advice on my Ph.D. work, and where I can take my research. And just cool things that I could do to make it better or, you know, what I could do for professional development. So, attending conferences, just kind of gives me like a mentorship kind of relationship with these women. And so, just meeting with them and being able to talk with them, it was very inspiring to me. So…  Host: Very cool. So, tell me about your experience so far, Shelita. Because I think, did you start when, during the pandemic, when everything was remote? So how did you navigate that, and then get to meet some of these inspiring women that, that sort of guided your path through, through NASA?  Shelita Hall: Yeah. At first, I was actually in-person at LaRC. I was in-person up until March. And so as soon as March hit, that's when I was virtual, and when I was in virtual [inaudible] --  Host: Ah ha.  Shelita Hall: So, yeah, I was actually able to meet people in-person. And I would actually just walk over to the next building and just like meet different people. And then seeing what other cool things they were working on. And I actually went to the radiation analysis like, branch or department in one of the buildings at LaRC on center. And I just kind of met with different people. And I actually met my soon to be, at that time mentor. And he agreed to do an internship with me. And he also knew my Ph.D. advisor. And so, I was able to network in-person. And that's one thing that I do miss, but I had that experience. And it was really awesome. You know, just the different events that I was able to attend in-person, but I was able to, you know, have that relationship with my mentor in-person. And she was just very inspiring just the way she carried herself. And she was super intelligent. And she was just a really great mentor. And I just, I just really appreciate her for giving me that first opportunity.  Host: Very cool. Now, now Sophia, tell me about your journey to end up at NASA.  Sophia Hahn: Sure. So, my journey to end up at NASA was kind of a surprise a little bit in a way. I had, basically, applied through the intern website, the intern.nasa.gov website, for a few different times, and didn't quite get it. I had gotten interviewed for a different position and was not selected to go forward for that. So, for me, I was pretty unconfident that I would get, that I would actually get a NASA internship. And so, I joke with my family that it was the best Christmas present I received last year. It was just late December, right around Christmas time, I got an email from my now mentor asking interview for the Prandtl-M project, which the whole long name is Preliminary Research Aerodynamic Design To Land on Mars, but it's kind of a mouthful. So, I'll just be calling it Prandtl-M for here on out. So, yeah, the interview happened. And then I got an offer letter. And I was surprised a little bit, because just from the previous rejections, as well as trying for years, and still not quite getting it, but I am so thankful that I did, because, for me, this is the exact kind of thing I want to be working on. It's the mechanical design of experimental aircraft, essentially. And that is what I'm getting my degrees for, hopefully. So, for me, in my path to NASA, it's kind of an unexpected one, but I'm so glad to be here, because I've always wanted to be here. I've always wanted to work for NASA since I was a kid. To me, NASA was the company that was always purely in pursuit of science and innovation, and not necessarily the bottom line. And that, to me, was like the most ideal thing. And this pushing the innovation and pushing kind of the realms of technology that we have now, has always been something that's important to me, and something that I wanted to do when I grew up back then, for lack of a better way to say it. So, yeah, I'm really excited and really happy. Just kind of stumbled onto a little bit by accident. But, yeah, I'm really happy to be here.  Host: Well, that's awesome. Now, now that you are here, though, you've got your foot in the door for this Prandtl-M, I think is how you pronounced it. Can you tell me more about that project?  Sophia Hahn: Yeah. Yeah. So, it's one of those backronym-type projects. The Prandtl part is from a famous mathematician named Ludwig Prandtl. He came up with two different lifting-line theories, which are basically the way lift kind of goes over the airplane from or an aerodynamics point of view. Long story short, one of the theories has been used for hundreds of years, like since the Wright brothers sort of thing. And the other theory that he released ten-ish years later, is the one that we're using. And it's not very common, because there's a lot of kind of finetuning with it. You have to know certain features about the aircraft. And for a long time, it was thought impossible. But, recently, with the previous chief scientist Al Bowers, who was the previous chief scientist for Armstrong Flight Research Center, he was able to do the Prandtl-D (Priliminary Research Aerodynamic Design to Lower Drag) project that actually made it work. He found out that that second lifting-line theory was what actually worked for and could actually be much more efficient than most of airplanes. We're talking like 11% to 15% more efficient. We are basically taking his theoretical work, that he did with the Prandtl-D project, and creating a practical application, which is a glider that will fly on Mars, that we're hoping that with the new kind of experimental lifting line being more efficient, as well as the less gravity on Mars, we'll actually be able to have functioning gliders that, hopefully, can travel ranges that our previous rovers, or even the Mars helicopter, could not travel in the same amount of time we did. Like we could go so much farther, so much faster sort of thing.  Host: See, this is absolutely fascinating, because I bet you when your friends are asking, \"hey, hey Sophia, what are you doing at NASA?\" You're like, \"eh, not a big deal. Just using this theoretical physics theory to figure out how to fly a glider on Mars. What are you up to?\" So, I feel like that, that must be some serious bragging rights. But, you know, after you get past that, what's really interesting to me is what you're talking about is what NASA is doing, and what you are working on, is pushing the idea of how we understand flight. So that's sort of a, I mean, it's a bigger benefit than just figuring out how to figure out gliding on Mars. It sounds like a lot of, there's a lot of practical stuff that you can pull from there to figure out our knowledge of just how air, how flight works. It sounds like that's something that you're on the precipice of.  Sophia Hahn: Yeah, I actually, just yesterday, we had a small kind of session with the students that I'm mentoring for the Robotics Team [inaudible]. And they actually were asking about the project. And it was kind of one of those really fun moments for me as a mentor, because I got a -- I'm the only female mentor on the team that I mentored for. So, I kind of got to watch all these students, and especially the female students, right, at seeing me as kind of a female engineer working on these really cool projects. And got to explain the parts that I'm allowed to explain. And that to me -- I'm still so happy from that event. Like I'm still thrilled that that happened. But, yeah, so the way we're doing it is telling my students is we're eliminating the need for a vertical tail. So, most people will see the vertical tail [inaudible] on the back of like a passenger aircraft. It's kind of like a little triangle shape, and it's got a little flap at the end of it. Our theory on lifting completely eliminates that. So that cuts weight on the aircraft. That makes it more efficient. There's no longer the drag from that. And this is all kind of going back to birth, more or less. Specifically, Al Bowers cites the wandering albatross. But if you look at the lift distribution on their wings, and like their kind of body shape, they don't have vertical tails, because they don't need to, because they follow this lifting line sort of thing. And they get to travel the world eight times I believe. Yeah, circle the world, essentially, they fly and [inaudible] circle the world eight times in a given year. So, we're hoping that kind of going back a little bit, and looking a little bit at nature, and Ludwig Prandtl's work, that we can completely revolutionize flight in the future, and make it more efficient. Therefore, burning less fuel, making it more green. And, hopefully, help make aviation a little more climate friendly.  Host: See, I'm so inspired by this, Sophia, because you're talking about, you're talking about redefining how humanity views something. Right? And, in this case, it's flight. But another thing I pulled from your story is just how excited you were to, you know, I'm sure during your path to get to NASA, and start working on this stuff, you had a lot of people that inspired you. But it seems like you're already in that position, where you have, I'll say a responsibility, right, to inspire others, because you said you're the only, you're the only woman, mentor right now. And so, you know, people are looking at you and say, \"hey, you look like me. I want to do what you're doing. I want to be like you.\" What's it like to assume that, that role model status already?  Sophia Hahn: Yeah, it's definitely a little nerve wracking from time to time. After all, I'm still going through college myself, and still haven't fully gotten into a full-set career. But I like to see it, especially with mentoring the robotics team, as giving back. For me, my high school robotics experience, and the mentors and the students who were with me on my journey, were the defining, like one of the, if not the most, important defining factor in going into aviation for me. So, if I can even help one student kind of figure out that engineering is what I want to do, or aviation's what I want to do, that's always been important to me. I've been really fortunate to have a family that emphasizes on giving back or helping others. So, to me, this is the way that kind of I like to help others. And that's just mentoring, and kind of helping the students grow in their engineering abilities, as well as, just soft skills like leadership or meeting scheduling, and that sort of thing; budgeting even. That, to me, also in turn kind of inspires me a little bit to keep going on my path. And, hopefully, I've done more than just inspire one student. But, yeah, my goal every day if I can just inspire one student to keep going with engineering, who’s maybe a little bit on the fence, then I'm doing what I need to be doing.  Host: That is awesome. Emily and Shelita, I want to hear more about some of the stuff you're doing at NASA as well. Emily, I'll go over to you first. What are some of the projects you're working on, now that you're here?  Emily Anderson: Yeah. So, I spent some time working on the checksum application. So, what a checksum is, is when the spaceship goes into space, the code on that spaceship sometimes runs into bit flips due to radiation. And so, this radiation can turn a one into a zero, or a zero into a one, and then cause issues for the software program. And so, what a checksum does is it relays that information back and is able to identify if that issue, if there is an issue, if there is a bit flip and something goes wrong. And so, these checksums, and these different applications that Goddard has, checksum is the one that I specifically worked on. But Goddard has 12 applications in total. And so, I worked on the checksum application. And what I did was I modified the code to raise it a classification level. So, it was for the Lunar Gateway mission, it needs to be at the highest classification level, because any mission that has humans involved, or any mission that has a budget over a certain number, needs to have Class A software. And so, I made modifications in the code just to actually help raise that classification level. And did testing, and I wrote unit tests and functional tests, to be able to test that code, and make sure that it was able to be verified against the credentials.  Host: See, that's big, Emily, because I know I'm -- you know, we're working with a lot on the operations side. Part of the reason that a lot of spacecraft, especially the human-rated spacecraft that I'm working with a lot, they have a lot of these redundant systems. Specifically, because of what you're saying. You know, sometimes you can, they can flip numbers. And, all of a sudden, your data becomes unreliable. So, the way they do that is they have multiple systems. What you're talking about is making data that's coming from a spacecraft even more reliable than, than even with these checks and balances that are currently in place. It sounds like you can do it from a software perspective. Which has a lot of, I mean, there's a lot that we can pull from that making future spacecraft more efficient and, and reliable. Now you don't have to worry so much on all these different computers doing redundant calculations. It sounds like you can even trust -- you can trust your systems even that much more, which really helps us out in spaceflight.  Emily Anderson: Yeah, yeah, it's a fantastic system.  Host: Very cool. Now, Shelita, Emily is talking about radiation from a software perspective. It sounds like a lot of the stuff you're working on is radiation/astronauts. Tell me about some of the stuff you're doing.  Shelita Hall: Yeah. So, basically, with Norfolk State, I'll be actually doing work with animals, and exposing them to radiation to kind of see what happens to their brain. And then understanding the behavioral consequences as a result. And from these behavioral consequences, we can kind of know what will potentially happen to an astronaut in space. But with this software technology, we're able to stimulate the central nervous system, and the effects of radiation exposed to it. And we're able to expose the CNS to different types of radiation, GCRs and solar particle agents. And from the penetration, we can know what will happen to different components in the central nervous system. And then we can kind of relate this data with the ground studies with the actual animal research. And we can kind of compare and see the different data from two different aspects. And so, right now, actually, at NASA, [inaudible] the different radiation transport software. And I'm just kind of understanding how it works, and the code involved, because I'm not really too experienced with code. So, I just started kind of, you know, with this computational analysis because, you know, my bachelor's is in chemistry. And I only took like two computer science classes. So, it's definitely a learning experience. But I wasn't afraid. I just kind of took it head on. And I've been learning two different radiation transport software’s right now. And so, with this, I can kind of compare with the actual animal exposure research. And so, you see different aspects. And from this, you can know the risk involved with long-term spaceflight. You know, how can we keep our astronauts safe? That's, you know, really important, because we want to bring them back safe. And we want to make sure that the radiation, you know, we have the correct spacesuits to shield. And so, from this research, we're hoping to promote the correct shielding countermeasures in order to keep the astronauts safe.  Host: What, what I love about each of you is what you've described is just some -- everything you're working on, each of you, is hugely impactful to spaceflight, to what we do on Earth. What you're doing is you're shaping the future. Each of the things that you're working on, you're all shaping the future now. For all those young women out there listening to this podcast, I feel like a lot of them may be thinking, \"man, I'm nowhere near as smart as Shelita. There's, there’s not a chance that I can keep up with that.\" But I feel like maybe people have more ability than they think. And maybe, Shelita, you had some obstacles along the way that you had to overcome to get to where you're working on such cool and innovative things for the future. So, so to, to the women out there listening, and hearing your story, Shelita, thinking, \"I don't know if I could do this,\" what advice do you have to them to say, keep going?  Shelita Hall: Yeah, I would definitely just say just to get rid of that mindset from the beginning. Just don't think that you can't do it. Just believe in yourself. And, for me, I had to instill that, that mindset. It wasn't, you know, automatic. I had to believe in myself and believe that just because it looks kind of weird, you know, engineering classes, I can do it. And if anyone else can learn, I can learn, too. And I just kind of took it head on. And I just learned what I could. And I asked questions. I wasn't afraid to ask questions. And I just kind of got rid of the notion that science and engineering is hard. You know, I just kind of gave myself the mentality like I can learn anything I put my mind to. And that's what I hope that other young women will do as well. And they would, you know, it's OK to be uncomfortable. And it doesn't mean that you're not smart enough. Just keep going and just keep learning all that, all that you can.  Host: Sophia, same, same question to you. Women that are maybe trying, trying to become pilots, and they want to, want to work on spacecraft, but they -- or aircraft rather, but they're hearing your story. And being like, \"man, there's no way that I can do something like that.\" A piece of advice for them?  Sophia Hahn: Yeah. My biggest piece of advice, and something I tell my students all the time, is the knowledge that you have right now does not define your entire career. What matters the most at this moment is do you have passion for what you do? If you do, and like if you really like engineering, and this is something, you really like aviation, and you're hearing what I'm saying, and it sounds like, “wow, I want to go do that,\" in a good way, don't focus on the fact that maybe your knowledge isn't fully up to speed. Or maybe it's great in certain areas or lacking in others. Knowledge will always come. What's important is that you have the passion, because that's what drives getting that knowledge. I have seen students, who didn't even know what a Phillips-head screwdriver was, become the best design students on a robotics team. And be able to create very, very intricate subsystems that require many motors, and lots of moving gears and lots of moving parts, belts, pulleys; the works essentially. And they still only have a high school level education. The knowledge will come, as long as you're willing to seek it. And you can get to wherever you want, as long as you have the passion and the drive to kind of keep going. And as long as you don't tell yourself no, because it's not true. You totally can do it. You'll be wherever you want to be in the aviation or the aerospace field. And from what I have found, through mine, it is a very welcoming field. So, keep pushing yourself. You're doing great. Keep going. Take notes. Do well in your classes. Try to find some kind of physical experience, too, whether it's mentoring a local robotics team, joining -- clubs at your school, trying to get internships, whether it be here at NASA or anywhere else. Just really kind of keep pushing yourself. And you'll be there. You'll be exactly where you want to be in the end.  Host: That's awesome. Emily, some advice from you to the young women out there listening.  Emily Anderson: Yeah, definitely. I think Shelita touched on a very, very important topic that she attacked -- she started programming. And she started this. And she said she didn't have too much experience, but she was able to learn that. And I think that that's really, really key is that no matter what you do, as long as you set your mind to it, you are 100% able to do it. It may have this wrap around it that, I think STEM and I think that engineering, in general, just have this wrap around it that it's hard and it's difficult. And that even programming and coding is just so hard. And who could ever do that? But if you set your mind to it, programming and engineering, they're solving some of the world's coolest problems right now. Like NASA just 3D printed organs. And they're sending human life into space. It's amazing the things that the STEM field is accomplishing. And I think that if you really do -- like Sophia and Shelita said, if you really set your mind to it, you're able to achieve anything. And it's just so also important to bring your full self to work at all times. You do not need to choose between fashion and makeup, and all of these girly things, and science. You're able to have both of them. And you don't need to compromise yourself for anything. Just bringing your full self to work at all times. And you'll succeed no matter what. And I just really, really think that's an important topic. We need females in STEM. And so just keep going, and never give up.  Host: I love it. Keep going. Work hard at it. And if, if you're passionate about something, just go for it, and put the work in. So, so Emily, it seems like a lot of your experiences have led you to, to even, even grander places and different places. And this just goes along with that theme of just keep going. You know, keep diversifying your experience as well. So, tell me about where you are, and some of your hopes and aspirations for the future?  Emily Anderson: So, currently, I'm interning at Tesla in Fremont, California. I'm on the digital experience team here. So just everything tesla.com is what I've been working on lately. And so, I've really, really enjoyed it so far, but I still have four more semesters of school left. So, two more full years. And I really, really hope to be back at NASA someday. I have aspirations, I've always wanted to be an astronaut since I was a little girl. And I still haven't given up on that dream. So, hopefully, I'm able to achieve that someday. And, hopefully, I'm back at NASA.  Host: That's awesome, Emily. So, Sophia, same question to you. Some of the things that that you're aspiring to, what are the some of the next steps for you?  Sophia Hahn: Sure. So, I will basically be doing this internship until the end of summer. After that, I plan to complete my bachelor's in aerospace engineering. And then go on to earn a master's in mechanical engineering at Tennessee State University. Kind of looking at a career-wise, I'm hoping to hopefully make it back to NASA, but I'd like to be a project manager working with the mechanical design of experimental aircraft. I really like this idea of pushing kind of the aviation knowledge envelope forward and seeing if we can have kind of the next generation of planes with these new kind of experimental ideas. And my internship with the Prandtl-M team has really solidified that desire. Like I had kind of a guess that I wanted to do more kind of experimental aerodynamics and that sort of thing, and kind of more experimental-style aircraft. And now, I'm fairly, I'm like completely certain in it that this is what I want to do. So, thank you to the Prandtl-M team for kind of helping me solidify that desire. So that's kind of my academic and career path, hopefully, looking forward.  Host: Very cool. Now, now Shelita, some, some aspirations from you.  Shelita Hall: Yeah. So, I'm hoping to continue the Ph.D. program. And I'm hoping to, you know, continuing on with my space medicine research. And I'll be, hopefully, working closely with NASA LaRC, with the product that I'm working on. And, in the future, I'm hoping to apply to a Pathways position, so that I can get employed by NASA. And I'm just very excited about the different opportunities that will come available. And I'm just very excited about my research. And I'm hoping to just meet more people and network. And I'm just very excited about the future.  Host: Very cool! You all have a lot of great things that you've contributed to so far. And definitely keep pursuing those dreams, just like you are recommending some of our listeners to do, and you're taking the actions yourself to, to go ahead and pursue. So, so to each of you, Sophia, Shelita, and Emily, thank you so much for coming on Houston We Have a Podcast, and sharing your story, and giving some, some wonderful advice. So, I appreciate your time.  Sophia Hahn: Thank you so much. It's been really, really fun. It's been a great pleasure of mine to be here.  Shelita Hall: Thank you so much.  Emily Anderson: Yeah, thank you. Thank you very much. It's been an honor to help, hopefully, inspire the young female generation into STEM.  [ Music] Host: Hey, thanks for sticking around. I had a really fun conversation with Sophia, Shelita and Emily today. I hope you learned something and got inspired by their unique stories to working at NASA.

                        "description": "Gary Jordan: Houston, We Have a Podcast. Welcome to the official podcast of the NASA Johnson Space Center, episode 20, Special Delivery. I'm Gary Jordan, and I'll be your cohost today, along with Matt Buffington, director of public affairs at NASA's Ames Research Center in California, and the host of NASA in Silicon Valley Podcast. Matt, what's up?  Matthew Buffington: Hey Gary, we're doing great, so glad we could team up on this. This is also concurrently episode 69 for the NASA in Silicon Valley Podcast. There's a ton of overlap between our listeners, so I'm really glad we were able to make this happen.  Gary Jordan: Yeah, me too. Today is a very special episode, because we're teaming up with NASA in Silicon Valley Podcast to talk about some of the things we can find in a cargo vehicle when it's shipped to space, which is perfect because SpaceX will be sending its Dragon Cargo Vehicle to the International Space Station here soon. So, who do we have from Ames, Matt?  Matthew Buffington: Over here we're bringing in Dennis Leveson-Gower. He's a project scientist here over at Ames, and has tons of experience working on cargo, working on payloads, and sending them on up to the space station. How about over there in Houston?  Gary Jordan: We'll have Shane Kimbrough. He's a NASA astronaut who recently spent about six months on the space station and landed earlier this year. We've actually had him on the podcast to talk about his landing experience back in episode three. But while he was up there, he had quite a few cargo vehicles visit the station. He had the SpaceX Dragon, Orbital ATK Cygnus, Japanese HTV, and the Russian Progress all within his six-month stay aboard the station. So, it's fair to say he knows what cargo on station is all about. He performed hundreds of experiments with the science that was delivered on some of those vehicles, and even got some fresh food, so I'm excited to ask him about that experience.  Matthew Buffington: Awesome. I'm really excited to get the different perspective on both the science, on the space station, so we can see the astronaut's point of view, and the people who actually design those experiments.  Gary Jordan: Yeah, this is going to be a good episode. So, with no further delay, let's go light speed and jump right ahead to our talk with Shane Kimbrough and Dennis Leveson-Gower. Enjoy.  Okay, all right, it looks like we're all connected, ready to go. How about this, Houston We Have a Podcast and NASA Silicon Valley combined?  Matthew Buffington: Yeah, this is going to be sweet.  Gary Jordan: Sweet, I know, I'm pumped. And we're doing this remotely, so here in Houston, I'm in the studio with NASA astronaut and no stranger to Houston We Have a Podcast, Shane Kimbrough. Shane, thanks for being here.   Shane Kimbrough: Hey, great to be here.  Gary Jordan: Cool, and how about over at Ames, Matt, who do you have?  Matthew Buffington: I'm sitting over here with my buddy Dennis Leveson-Gower. We actually go way back from SpaceX 8, was it Dennis?  Dennis Leveson-Gower: That's right.  Matthew Buffington: I always remember it because it was the first time SpaceX had launched a rocket and landed it on a barge. And Dennis was nice enough as I drove him back and forth from his office to do press interviews and stuff.  Gary Jordan: Nice enough indeed.  Matthew Buffington: Exactly so, I always like to start our podcast with the question of, how did you get to NASA, how did you end up in Silicon Valley. I definitely want to hear about that from Shane as well, but let's start off with Dennis. So tell us about, how did you end up at NASA?  Dennis Leveson-Gower: I really ended up here by accident. I was set to be a professor, discover things, have graduate students. I did a Ph.D. in biochemistry. Then I went to Stanford for a post-doctoral fellow doing bone marrow transplantation, graft vs. host disease, immunology. And slowly over the years, I thought, I'm going to go to industry. I'm not going to do the academic track anymore. It was a slow evolution. So I was out there, had my resume posted on job sites and stuff, looking around. Just got an email saying, are you interested in a position at NASA Ames? And I'm like, this is spam. I don't know anything about rockets, I'm not an engineer. I'm a biologist.   So, talked to my wife. She's like, you have to apply, it's NASA. So I thought, all right, at least I can go and see the base and look around, because I saw it on the side of the highway, so I knew there was some NASA thing here. And yeah, it was when I talked to the hiring manager, she really convinced me this was a really cool opportunity. Got me into a different head space of not just doing basic research, but doing applied research, and working with a whole different cadre of engineers and operations and safety.   And I don't know, it just really appealed to me, so I took a chance and took the job.  Matthew Buffington: That's pretty awesome. I always say, when people think of NASA, they think of rockets and telescopes. Biology is a huge part of that. Speaking of that, sometimes we have humans up in space.  Gary Jordan: Excellent segue. All right, Shane, how about you? How did you become an astronaut?  Shane Kimbrough: I came -- there's several obviously avenues to be an astronaut. I came through the military. I was an Army officer, Apache pilot my whole Army career. I took a little detour toward the end of I would say my conventional Army career when I went to graduate school at Georgia Tech, and then I went to teach math at West Point for a few years.  And then from there, I was called to come work down at Johnson Space Center for a few years. I had applied to be an astronaut that year, didn't get selected. But the good news was, I was I guess somewhat in the highly qualified category, so the Army detachment down here asked me to come down here and work for a few years. And that was to really get ready for the 2002 astronaut selection. Guess what, that selection never happened. So, we went through the whole thing, interviews and everything, and it never happened. Congress decided they didn't need a class that year.  So, we hung around for another couple years, which in a way was somewhat rolling the dice on my Army career. But my wife and I felt it was where we wanted to be and what we wanted to do, so stuck around, and was lucky enough to get selected in 2004.  Gary Jordan: Lucky and persistent enough.  Shane Kimbrough: Yeah, persistence is a big trait, I think. It was my fourth time to apply.  Matthew Buffington: I was going to say, isn't that normal for astronauts? Because we had Steve Smith a while back on our podcast, and I think he had applied three or four times as well.  Shane Kimbrough: Yeah, I think at least it used to be the norm. A lot of times these days, at least in the last couple classes, we've had a lot of first-timers. But yeah, for folks a little older like myself, I think three or four times is pretty normal.  Gary Jordan: I remember talking with the 2017 class, and a couple of them applied multiple times. I know for sure Raja Chari did, but you're right, a couple of them are first-timers. But then you've got folks like Clay Anderson, who applied like, what, eight or nine times or something? So yeah, right.  Shane Kimbrough: Persistence.  Gary Jordan: Exactly, persistence, and it works out too. This is perfect, to combine forces for the podcast today -- Houston We Have a Podcast and NASA in Silicon Valley -- because today's topic is cargo, and cargo going to the International Space Station. And Shane, I feel like you're the perfect person to have on the podcast today, because you've seen your fair share of cargo vehicles on your last mission, right?  Shane Kimbrough: Yeah, we saw everything, and we saw Cygnus twice. We had a lot of vehicles coming and going. And really cargo, when you think about it, it's the way we handle the logistics problem on the space station. It's a big logistics problem, if you think about it, to get equipment and clothes and food and experiments to that orbiting laboratory. So, how do we do that? We used to do it with the space shuttle. It was nice and easy, it could haul a bunch of stuff. Now, we can't do that, so we have these cargo vehicles you're talking about.  Gary Jordan: That's right, because on your way to the space station, you can bring stuff, but now you need stuff delivered. It's a huge complex. It's the size of a five-bedroom house, it needs stuff -- food, supplies, all that kind of things.  Matthew Buffington: That's one of the funny things as we were coming in, especially as we're getting closer for the SpaceX 13 launch coming into it. We see there's the both sides -- there's the people up at the space station working on receiving the cargo or even science experiments, but also on the flipside of, how do you get that stuff prepared? That is a feat in and of itself.  Gary Jordan: That's true. So Dennis, what do you have to do to prepare stuff to go on cargo missions?  Dennis Leveson-Gower: That's a big question, because I mean, it really starts one to two years ahead of the launch, if you think about it, or more, because after you have an experiment defined, you've got to prepare exactly what the science requirements are, then you've got to start making a plan, then you've got to start assessing what the hardware needs are, and the kits' needs are, then you have to design those, then they have to get through safety, you have to plan operations, you have to plan how everything's going to be labelled.  And then, usually I think somewhere between three and six months before a launch is when we're going to actually have things prepared, off-gassed, tested, H-fit, label committee, all those things, and do the early load. And then we start preparing the late load chemicals and perishables that have to be loaded 25 hours before launch. And we do that out at Kennedy Space Center for SpaceX launch, anyways.   So, there's a whole experiment development cycle that happens, and that's just for one payload. And if we have five or six payloads from Ames coming out, that's a lot of work from a lot of people to send a box of something.  Matthew Buffington: It takes a village for it, gathering all that stuff up. But I'm always curious on your guys' side, Shane, for you guys, when you receive this cargo, how exactly does that happen, or how does that work? Like, you're unpacking a trunk from a trip?  Shane Kimbrough: No, we're always excited to open up the hatch and get new stuff. It's kind of like Christmas every time we get one of these vehicles up there. But the way we go about unpacking is very organized, and it has to be that way. We have a great team on the ground that gets us ready and prepared with all kind of documents, and keeps us organized with charts and things on how they want it to be unpacked. And so, we follow that religiously.  We'll have somebody in the crew is going to be called the loadmaster, and that person's responsible for that vehicle. If we just start pulling things out and stowing things where we want to stow them, that's not the way it's going to be, because we'll never find that stuff. We really have to be disciplined, and put things where they're supposed to go. A lot of times, that means we'll take one bag out, and the bag will have 100 different items in it. And we have to go put those 100 things somewhere.  So, it's not as easy as pulling a bag out and stuffing it somewhere. Sometimes it is, but most of the time it's not. So, we've really got to make sure we're all helping each other out. And it's always better to, as I've found with all these cargo ops, to do it as a team versus doing it individually. You're much more efficient, and you can have one person reading the book, keeping control of everything, and the other couple people running things around. And that really worked well for us.  Gary Jordan: So, everything has an order and a destination, right? You've got to unload this first, and put it in this location, and it's all scheduled that way. How long does it take you to unload completely?  Shane Kimbrough: I think we actually set some records for unloading vehicles the quickest, which is a good thing I guess. But, we really -- and we did it by working together as a team. And that's the only way. Thomas [Pesquet] and Peggy [Whitson] and I would knock out a vehicle, no kidding, in a day and a half or two. But, that's pretty unusual. That was kind of if it happened to show up just before a weekend, we used the weekend to do it, so it was a freebie. Where if they had it just playing out during a normal week, it would take a week to two weeks sometimes depending on the vehicle to get it unloaded.  Gary Jordan: That's right, because you've got to fit it with everything else you're doing. Wow, amazing.  Matthew Buffington: Yeah, and a lot of that, I'd imagine it's already complicated enough, and I'm sure it's crazy complicated even just within NASA, but then you start throwing in all these private companies and different groups. Is everybody, how do you keep -- maybe you guys could talk about, how do you keep everybody on the same page on how things get prepared. Because Dennis, you're preparing this stuff for these companies, but then . . .  Dennis Leveson-Gower: I think they all go through NASA. You'll have private hardware developers, but the manifest is controlled through NASA, and the crew procedures are controlled through NASA. Shane, correct me if I'm wrong, but at some certain point has to be layered into the controlled process of NASA, even if it's like -- so, you could think of it as NASA buying things from different vendors, but they'll manage how it goes up, or they'll manage it through SpaceX how it goes up.  Shane Kimbrough: Totally agree. We saw differences, of course, because the vehicles are all different inside, so the way they, location coding is all different, and where things might be on one is different than another. That's the only difference, but bottom line is, you're going to get a bag, you're going to take it somewhere, you're going to take it apart, and take those things somewhere. And if we keep it pretty simple like that, it made it easier on the crew.  Gary Jordan: Definitely. You're the pro mover when it comes to cargo missions.  Shane Kimbrough: I'm going to get a reputation here.  Gary Jordan: So what are some of the main differences, then, in terms of, Dennis, on your end, for qualifications, and we can start with that -- what's the difference to get it on that vehicle? But then Shane, for unpacking it, some of those little tiny things?   Dennis Leveson-Gower: The biggest thing for us is always safety. We go to great lengths to try to have chemicals that will not interfere with the life support system, that won't be toxic to the crew if they're spilled. Everything that has a tox level will have certain levels of containers and containment that have to be layered onto how it's packaged and how it's stored.   Then, we have human factors. We have to make sure that the 5 percent Japanese female and the 5 percent American male can handle the things. And then, even right before it's loaded, there's an expert that comes in with gloves on and feels everything, to make sure there's no sharp edges on anything, and that it's not going to hurt anybody when they start pulling them out of the packages. That's what I've seen on my end, big picture.  Shane Kimbrough: I'd say from our end, it's very similar, like I mentioned before. But there are some things. Every vehicle that gets there, there's some critical items that need to come off first. And we're well aware of what those are, based on the ground team prepping us for that. And most of the time, those are delicate experiments or things like that that have to come off, or are time-sensitive. We'll obviously hit those first, and then after that we'll follow the script that the ground lays out for us, so that we're all on the same sheet of music, and everybody knows what's going on. Even if we're doing it in our spare time, where the ground control team might not be following, we can update them with, hey, we did sections two, three, and four, whatever it was, and they'll be caught back up with us when they get back on console.  Gary Jordan: Yeah, like if you're doing it on a weekend or something. Sweet. So, what's an example of time-critical, since you unpacked so many vehicles, what's an example of a time-critical experiment you had to unpack?  Shane Kimbrough: We had some rodents onboard, so that was one thing we had to get off. Those are always time-critical, just to get them setup in their habitations on the space station. That's one. I think some that just showed up today actually on the space station were things like pizza on ice cream. If you get things like that, those are time-critical, because you need to eat those quickly. Anyway, there's plenty of different, a wide range there I gave you from rodents to ice cream.  Matthew Buffington: And I have to chime in on that, because this isn't just the sad, dehydrated stuff you buy at the museum. This is a legit pizza.  Shane Kimbrough: This is the real deal, apparently. It's the first time I've heard of a pizza delivery going to the space station, so whatever company got that is going . . .  Matthew Buffington: 30 minutes or less.  Dennis Leveson-Gower: It's not going to be the best pizza, but it'll probably taste good to you guys.  Shane Kimbrough: Ice cream's legit, though. Of course, we didn't have any when I was there, but shortly after I left, they got some, and they're getting some today.  Gary Jordan: They waited until right after you left? Oh, man.  Shane Kimbrough: Apparently so.  Dennis Leveson-Gower: After SpaceX 8 launched, all the guys on the ground at KSC had all these Klondike bars filling the freezer. And I'm like, where did these come from? And they go, the CMC team, the cargo team, when they were packing all the cold stowage, if there's any empty areas in the freezers, they start stuffing ice cream bars in there, as a surprise for the crew. So, we have extra boxes of Klondike bars.  Shane Kimbrough: Always a welcome treat.  Matthew Buffington: But, when you're unpacking during this, are you in constant contact with the ground, and they're walking you through it, or it's just a mix of sometimes you are, sometimes you guys get your to-do list and you make it happen and update them later on?  Shane Kimbrough: Yeah, we have a couple meetings beforehand, of course, before the vehicle gets there, and there's a whole choreography they want us to do, and the order they want us to do it in. And so, we're disciplined and follow that to the T. A lot of times we'd have questions, or something wouldn't be where it was supposed to be, and that's where we'd call down real quickly and touch base with whoever was on console for that, so that we weren't getting out of their choreography, even if something wasn't there. But they were always there if we needed them. Usually, we would just tag up at the end of a day, end of a cargo day, and make sure to tell them exactly what we did so they were up to speed on everything.  Gary Jordan: I don't know if you got any Klondike bars. Was there any missions that gave you some nice treats?  Shane Kimbrough: I think almost every vehicle had care packages from our families onboard. Those are always a surprise, so that was kind of cool. We didn't get any ice cream, but we got a lot of fresh fruit, and that was kind of cool. That's another thing I think they hold onto, and if there's any extra space they'll cram them in there. But, some apples and oranges and things like that were really delicious after not having them for quite a while.  Gary Jordan: I was going to say, definitely a treat compared to -- it's fresh, it's literally fresh.  Shane Kimbrough: We ate those really quickly.  Gary Jordan: You kind of have to.  Shane Kimbrough: Yeah, don't want them to go bad.  Matthew Buffington: I'm wondering, as you get into the coordination that's needed, and even thinking on the side when, we have researchers, scientists who are creating science experiments, it's hard enough doing it in a lab on your own. And so, when people are -- I'm wondering, Dennis, from your perspective as people design and put these experiments together, but then Dennis -- or, Shane, on your side, actually conducting these things. Talk a little about that, what goes into making an experiment for someone else to do, and your instructions on how to do it? It seems very complicated. I'm looking at you, Dennis.  Dennis Leveson-Gower: Okay, what I'll receive is basically a grant proposal that had a very high science score from a panel of reviewers. And then I'll start looking at it and saying, can we actually do this in space? Because, crew time is very precious. You cannot do things as quickly in space as you can on the ground. We add a 1.4 margin of how long it would take us on earth, at a minimum. It's all got to be done in a self-contained glove box volume. And, I start working to make little tweaks and adjustments -- like I said, can we replace this chemical with a nontoxic one? Can we simplify this procedure? What's the tolerance of the timeline? Because, if they have to do an EVA, we can't have a time-critical part of our experiment at the same time they've got to be outside the station.  So, we start looking at every single factor, and it takes month to organize that. But then, eventually we get that down into a set of crew procedures, just like written, step-by-step, everything to do, and it should be simple as possible, even though these astronauts are super well trained and super smart. We make these super simple documents to send them. It's kind of funny. And then the training happens at JSC, where an experienced scientist will go and work with the astronauts, and make a fighter pilot into a biologist.  And then we send everything up. And then on my end, we're sitting in a control room watching a live video of the astronauts. It's very cool. And, talking to them. And usually, there's one designated person with the best speaking voice talking, and then there's five people in the room behind them with total chaos, yelling it's storage locker 5B, 6-Alpha, and they go, storage locker 5-6-B-Alpha. And then, we just are in their ear, pretty much, walking them through what we need them to do.  I know there's simpler payloads, where I think Shane would say you just follow written instruction, but for some of the more complicated things, we're actually talking to them, walking them through it.  Shane Kimbrough: Yeah, it's very helpful to have Dennis and his team there talking to us. These scientists in general have spent many years creating whatever the experiment is. The last thing we want to do is mess it up, or mess up any of their data. So, we want to be very careful in all that whole process Dennis explained about getting the experiment approved and then what he's got to do to get it in a crew procedure. That takes a lot of people a lot of time. And so, by the time it gets to us, it's pretty well refined. It's not perfect, because I haven't seen that procedure, and I might read something differently than Dennis would read it. So, it is so nice to have them on the horn, so to speak, right there talking to us in case we have any questions, so we don't mess up any of the experiment or any of the data.  Gary Jordan: That's true. And then off of Dennis' point of making them as simple as possible, a lot of it has to do with the fact that, you're right, these scientists spend so much time getting these procedures ready for this experiment, but that's not the only one you're doing. You are doing quite a few experiments.  Shane Kimbrough: Very true, and in general, we're not trained on all these. We're trained generically on experiments. Like Dennis alluded to, making a pilot a biologist for a day. I was lucky enough to have Peggy there, who is a biologist, so she could help me understand something that normally I wouldn't understand, because it's not in my background. But Dennis and his team can get some really complicated experiment into a procedure that's simple, like he said, so that even I can understand it. That's pretty good.  Gary Jordan: So, what else do you have to train for, besides the scientific experiments? Because Dennis also talked about, you have to train for EVAs, and on this last mission you did four, so that's quite a big chunk of time that takes away for science. And then you've got to train for unloading cargo vehicles. What else are you training for?  Shane Kimbrough: Those are the big ones. Of course, the cargo vehicles when they come up, we actually use the robotic arm to grab them, to capture them. So, a lot of our training is with the robotics team to make sure we do that operation successfully. Grabbing something that's going 17,500 miles an hour is not trivial. But, with our training, we always train of course for the worst-case scenarios, and the vehicles, at least when I was there, behaved very well. It seemed like it was simple, even though the stress is pretty high, the gains are up, because it's a real vehicle and you want to make sure we grab this thing and get it onboard. So, that's another piece of our training we do.  What else? Those are the big-ticket items. Operationally, EVAs, like you talked about, robotics, when we're capturing these vehicles, and most of the other time we're doing experiments. That makes up most of our days onboard the space station.  Gary Jordan: Yeah. Was it different to use the robotic arm to capture the different vehicles, or did it translate pretty well?  Shane Kimbrough: There are differences certainly with every vehicle. So, we had Cygnus, we had SpaceX, we had HTV from Japan, and we had a Russian vehicle, but that one docks automatically, so we didn't have to reach out with the robotic arm to grab that one. But, there are several differences, and the cues you use are different for every vehicle. Again, we get spun up by our training team a week or two prior to each vehicle showing up, so we remember you're looking here, not here, based on whatever the vehicle was, and using certain cues to help get the vehicle onboard.  Matthew Buffington: I'd imagine no matter how much you train on that, and I'm sure there's simulations and different things of remoting the giant robotic arm, I imagine once you're doing that for the first time, it's got to be nerve-wracking, because you're like, this is a very expensive toy, I don't want to mess this up.  Shane Kimbrough: Yeah, it was on the first time. And again, we got several opportunities, so I won't say it became less important, but you got more comfortable with it. But, it is a big deal. And I really wanted Tomas, the French astronaut I was flying with, to get a lot of experiment. So, when we were together, I grabbed the first one, and after that I let him grab all the other ones, to get his experience level up. And he'll go fly again here in a few years, hopefully, and be able to use all that experience to help his crewmates out when he's onboard.  Gary Jordan: Definitely. When you're training to capture these things, like Matt was saying, when you're in the real thing, it's a little bit different, but the training, I've seen it before. It's pretty detailed. There's a projection of, it's like a, I don't know, describe the training.  Shane Kimbrough: We have this, we call it a dome facility, because that's what it is, and the graphics are just fantastic. And it gives you the sense of speed in which things are coming together, and the rats that you're coming are very good. But, it's just not the real thing. It's like our pool. Our pool is amazing to train for space walks, but it's not the real thing. There are differences. And until you get up there -- and now, we're in the Cupola, we're flying almost all of these out of the Kupla, which maybe think about you're upside down flying it, so spatially you've got to get your head around where are the arms moving even though you're upside down, those kind of things. It's not super simple until you actually get up there and do it a few times, and then it becomes a little bit easier on the mind.  Gary Jordan: I can see why they would put you through the training for it, because there's a lot to think about, just being upside down, using the controls, controlling something from a Cupola, but then the arm's over here, I guess.  Shane Kimbrough: Right. So, it's not necessarily right out your window. It is in this case when you're in the Kupla, but you could fly it from the lab as well, and you wouldn't have any windows and you'd just be using cameras. That's what we used to do. That's what we did on my first flight. So, things have gotten a lot better in that regard.  Gary Jordan: I'm sure they write these procedures to be as easy as possible, so Dennis, what are some of the techniques you do whenever you're writing these scientific procedures for the astronauts to make it as easy as possible for them?  Dennis Leveson-Gower: Yeah, I mean, we try to boil it down to step-by-step, but also add in some rationale for why you're doing it a certain way, so they don't have to memorize the exact step, but they can know what the end goal is and why they're doing it, so they know I should make sure I keep this cold, or I should make sure I handle this gently. And then hopefully, that helps.   But I find that most of the time, it boils down to, we have the procedure, but then they say, tell me what to do next, and we're just talking to them.  Shane Kimbrough: Especially when we're in the glove box. We're immobile when we're in there. We can't move around and do things.  Dennis Leveson-Gower: Yeah, and how do you read something when you're doing that?  Shane Kimbrough: Yeah, so it's very helpful to have you guys onboard.  Matthew Buffington: And for me, going back, one thing that occurred to me as you're dealing with some, if it's a sensitive science experiment or the precious pizza cargo, I wonder, when you're packing, obviously there's a little bit of Tetris, where you're trying to place things into the cargo to be very efficient. But it's also, launches are quite intense. So I'd imagine, Dennis, I'd imagine things have to be durable enough to survive such a crazy, extreme, launching, and then it's floating in space, and then the big robotic arm that Shane's operating is grabbing it.  But then also, on the flipside, Shane, I'd imagine for you, being a human experiencing that sensation as well. But what goes into keeping things safe and packed in?  Dennis Leveson-Gower: Yeah, for especially things like the rodent habitat, we strap it to a table and we vibrate the heck out of it. It goes through launch impact testing, it gets put through temperatures, it goes through pressurization, depressurization. Anything like that goes through rigorous testing to make sure it stands up to things. And then, it's usually packed in some foam, into a locker. Then, it's put on a scale so that you can find the center of gravity of that hardware, and also the weight and dimensions. And then from that, some eggheads do some math, and some robots load it into the capsule the right way so it's all balanced. I don't understand all that part.  But, we just make sure that we've tested everything, whatever. And I mean, it's pretty excessive. Whatever could possible go wrong, we test, worst-case, and then we treat it as gently as possible. And yeah, then wrap it up and ship it up.  Matthew Buffington: And how is that, Shane, from your perspective being the human inside said rocket, vibrating and going through those intense pressures?  Shane Kimbrough: On the Soyuz, which is what I just flew on, I was very surprised on the launch how smooth it was. I had an experience on the space shuttle before, and it was rocking and rolling and shaking around like you'd imagine, and you see in the movies. But the Soyuz was super smooth. We pulled about 3Gs going uphill, but the ride itself was very smooth. I was very impressed.  Matthew Buffington: So, not only designing the experiments and getting them up, but you'd mentioned before, Dennis, that it could take years in this process. I'd imagine there's several experiments and ideas that never get into Shane's hands. Or, great ideas that just, either it's funding or different things. It's a competitive process, and everybody wants their cool science experiment to go up.  Dennis Leveson-Gower: Yeah, no, we have a queue of investigators going out to 2022. We're trying to get them flown off as fast as possible, but we're limited by launch vehicles and crew time. Crew time is becoming less of a concern, because we're getting an extra crew member up there. But now it's launch vehicles, and you can only launch so many experiments at a time. But, there's a whole list of reserve experiments, of people that have put their heart and soul into something, and they just need 15 minutes of crew time, and they're just hoping their experiment can get done.  Matthew Buffington: This is stuff that's already up there?  Dennis Leveson-Gower: I think they have over 100 experiments at a time on the ISS.  Shane Kimbrough: Yeah, I think we ended up doing 273, I was told, over the six months. But yeah, at any one time, there can be over 100 onboard, that's about right.  Dennis Leveson-Gower: And I remember someone saying, Peggy's going to get every one of those done. She's going to work through the backlog.  Matthew Buffington: Singlehandedly.  Shane Kimbrough: We took out all the task list and all the things that were backlogged, for sure. So, it was nice.  Dennis Leveson-Gower: Yeah, a lot of people over here appreciate it when you guys give up some of your free time and bang one of those experiments out.  Shane Kimbrough: Glad to do it.  Gary Jordan: That's true. What else, besides if you were to take the weekend to unpack a cargo vehicle, what else are you doing on the weekends?  Shane Kimbrough: Weekends, generally on Saturday mornings, it's spent cleaning. So, it's like your house, about once a week you need to probably do a little cleaning. So, we spend all Saturday morning vacuuming the whole station, wiping things down, and just getting everything back in shape after usually a busy week. And then, Saturday afternoons are generally off, and Sundays are generally off. So, I'm a big sports fan, so I was usually watching games, whether it was football or World Series or anything going on. Tomas got us into watching rugby. So, that was big in Europe at the time. So, we got to watch some of those matches. So, we do that as a crew sometimes, or sometimes individually you'd watch those things. And you certainly can catch up on emails or watch movies or call home or any of those things as well. Or, you can just look out the window, which was always spectacular, something you can't do here on earth. So, I tried to do that more often, because I can always talk to people or email people when I'm on earth, but I can't always look out the Kupla window for a rev around the earth in 90 minutes. That was pretty cool.  Matthew Buffington: I'm curious, how is that setup? You don't have a normal weekend like you would. It's not like you're commuting home and spending the weekend with your family. You're sitting there floating in space, so there's never really a day off. You're always on.  Shane Kimbrough: Correct. So I had to, when I was the commander, I made it clear to my crew that we were going to work from DBC to DBC, which is the morning conference with mission control all the way to the evening conference with mission control, but we weren't going to work outside of that. And there were a few exceptions on the weekends where we'd say, there's this one cargo vehicle, for example, we want to unload. Let's do two hours, and that's it. We're going to work two hours together. If you've got three people, that equates to about six hours of work. And we can do a lot in two hours.  But I would make sure we weren't working all weekend, because as the commander, I've got to make sure the crew is not exhausted, for one, so they can hit the next week's activities when Monday starts. But also, we've got to always be ready for that really bad day, an emergency onboard the space station, where that's in the middle of the night or during the day. The crew's got to be fresh enough to handle that. So, I'm always thinking about that as I'm working the crew and the crew's being worked by the ground. And sometimes, we have to modify what they want us to do in order to keep our reserves, so to speak, to be able to handle an emergency.  Gary Jordan: That's right. So, as a commander, how much jurisdiction do you have on time, because I know they schedule a lot of things for you, but then what power do you have as a commander?  Shane Kimbrough: Big picture, we'll talk. I'll talk with the lead flight director usually before the week, or maybe even two weeks out. We'll talk about the big picture, how things are going to flow, and what they want to get done. And then, the details just kind of flush out. I don't really have too much influence on that. I'll let the flight director know, here's what I want to focus on. Make sure we get maybe a day here or there because we worked last weekend, and those kind of things, because that happens a lot.  And then in general, if something's coming up real-time, day-of, maybe an experiment or something is running twice as long as it was expected -- that happens. And we'll just adjust real-time. Maybe I'll take the activity that Peggy was supposed to do next, if she's buried in this experiment, or vice versa. We'll help each other out to get all the things done. And you do that almost daily. You get done with something early, you go help somebody else if you can, or else you take something else off their timeline by knocking out something down the road for them.  Gary Jordan: Sounds like you guys were really tightknit. You guts needed to be a really tight team to get all this stuff done.  Shane Kimbrough: Totally agree, and I was super fortunate to have Peggy and Tomas onboard for about 90 percent of my time onboard. I was with Kate [Rubins] and Takuya [Onishi] for only a week or so, unfortunately for me, because they were superstars as well. But, they left shortly after we got there. So really, my whole mission was with Peggy and Tomas on the US side. And we did really work well together. We thought the same, our work ethic was the same, and we just loved helping each other out and loved being around each other, which doesn't always happen. So, I was very fortunate.  Gary Jordan: Very true. That makes me -- getting back on track to the cargo stuff, I was actually thinking about, we were talking a lot about when cargo comes up, how to get it, how to unpack it, but then, there's a packing story, and they're different for each vehicle, because some of them just burn up, some of them have experiments running before they burn up, and then some of them actually come back. What are some of the differences there?  Shane Kimbrough: Yeah, so we had all those. The only one that comes back to earth, as you're probably aware, is SpaceX. So, anything that's real critical experiment-wise, or even maybe broken equipment that engineers want to get their hands on to figure out what happened to it, those kind of things we'll put into SpaceX, so they can come back to the ground. A lot of that has to do with experiments we did on our bodies -- blood draws and those kind of things need to come back, as well as rodent research things will come back on SpaceX, because the scientists need to recover them and look at the data and get all that stuff.  That's one thing. All the other vehicles in general burn up, like you mentioned. So to me, I think of it, that's how we manage our trash. That's how we manage trash on the space station. We crate tons of trash, believe it or not, up there, whether it's food trash or clothes trash or experiment trash or waste, human waste. All that stuff needs to get off at some point. And the way we do that is to use these cargo vehicles that are not coming back to earth. And we can't just cram things in there, like you might think. It's a very organized way. And again, we'll get a plan from the ground team and mission control that lays out how they want us to pack it.  And a lot of times there are experiments onboard that will happen once it leaves the space station before it gets burned up, like you mentioned. So, we've got to make sure certain aisle ways are clear, and the airflow is going to be correct, so that those experiments can happen correctly.  Gary Jordan: I see. So, it's kind of like a supply chain, really, because there needs to be new stuff sent up to the International Space Station, and then you need to take some of the old stuff out. That's the cycle that keeps the ISS going.  Shane Kimbrough: Correct. And launch delays and things don't happen, and these launches aren't always happening on time. So, sometimes your trash backlog gets pretty high on the space station. That's not a -- there are some odors and things that go along with that. So, we always like to have vehicles coming frequently, so we can manage our trash, of course along with doing great experiments as well.  Gary Jordan: But you guys have plenty of food and all that kind of stuff, right? So, even if something gets delayed, you'll be set for a while, for at least a lot of things.  Shane Kimbrough: Yeah. I think they have about a six-month reserve onboard. So, we can handle a lot of delays, I guess.   Gary Jordan: Dennis, on your end, when it comes to these experiments coming back to earth, and especially on SpaceX, the ones you actually can get your hands on and don't burn up, what are some of the things you're looking at for those?  Dennis Leveson-Gower: Looking at getting it back as quickly as possible is usually our priority, especially with rodent experiments, cell science experiments. You're trying to study the effects of microgravity on these organisms, and the minute you start getting back into the earth's atmosphere, you're going to start to experience gravity and see molecular changes. So, the clock is ticking to try to get the samples back. So in the future, hopefully return vehicles can land on solid ground, and we get the samples back even faster.   Right now, it's taking about a day or two on a boat in the ocean. But yeah, the priority's obviously for animal experiments, we want all of them alive and happy. And so far, we've done it twice and they have been. JAXA has also done it twice. All the mice did really well on return. And, yeah, intact samples kept at the right stowage temperatures and everything, then we're happy.  Matthew Buffington: On a similar note, and this is a slight pivot, but I love the little catchphrase of working off the earth for the earth. We've talked a lot about how it all happens, from an idea, an experiment, it's created, it's packed, it's sent up, then you actually conduct it. But, I'd love to pick your brain, Dennis and also Shane, of the why. Why is doing experiments in microgravity important? Clearly NASA and the international community is spending a lot of money to put this thing up here. And, what can we get out of that that you just can't do on the ground?  Dennis Leveson-Gower: Yeah, there's a lot that we can't do on the ground. My bias is that we want to go to Mars, and we want to explore space, and we want to make Star Trek real, so we should be figuring out what happens to our bodies, what happens to physical processes on a cellular level, really understand the biology and what changes when the vector of gravity is removed.  Of course, there is objectives to benefit the earth, as you say, and one prime example is, you can't have forced bedrest of research animals, but if they're in space, all the gravity load is off, and it will mimic conditions where people have extended bedrest or unloading on their muscles.  You also, microgravity seems to have an accelerated aging effect, so you can look at age-related factors. You have fluid shifts, and basically high blood pressure in your brain, and that starts affecting the astronauts' vision and things like that, and we want to understand how that works.  So, you have a lot of, like, growing 3D tissues in the lab. To be able to do those kind of things, you may be able to do them better in space, and understand the processes better in space. And I think it directly translates into, benefits the earth. Sometimes, you have to connect the dots a little bit to see how that space research affects the ground, but if you look at every experiment we've done, it always has spin-off benefits.  Shane Kimbrough: Tough to add much to that. It's very true. The way I look at it is, everything we do up there is either for future exploration, like Dennis mentioned, or it's to help humanity in general. If we're not doing that, I think we're really missing the boat. But everything we touch up there and I've been involved with has met one of those two criteria.  One example I like to think of is, we have this machine up there that makes water. It takes every bit of liquid onboard the space station, from urine to sweat to condensation to anything, and it goes into this machine and it makes water that's extremely pure that we use for our food and our drinks the next day, so to speak. It's a great technology for us to have. It's not something we have to have for the space station, but we will have to have something like that for Mars, or the moon, or wherever we're going to go deep space. So, we're working on that now for future exploration.  A side benefit of this whole thing is, we actually use that technology on earth as well. There's third-world countries that don't have clean water supplies, and the same technology is helping them get clean water. That's really a cool thing when you're helping future exploration and you're helping humanity.  Gary Jordan: That's just one example, right? That's one thing on the station that's helping in both directions. Matt, I think that's a really good place to end the podcast.   Matthew Buffington: I think that's perfect, dude.  Gary Jordan: I think that's fantastic, because it kind of sums up why do we do all the science, and why the science goes up and down to the International Space Station. Guys, thanks so much for coming on the show, both to Shane and Dennis for coming on Houston We Have a Podcast and NASA in Silicon Valley, the first time we're doing this together. Matt, I really hope we can do this again.  Matthew Buffington: With our powers combined, it works out. Thanks a lot for helping pull this together. This has been a lot of fun.  Gary Jordan: Yeah, absolutely. Thanks, guys.  Shane Kimbrough: It was great, thanks everybody.   Dennis Leveson-Gower: Thanks for having me.  Matthew Buffington: Huge thanks to Dennis and Shane. Awesome.  [END]  Gary Jordan: Hey, thanks for sticking around. So today, we teamed up with the NASA in Silicon Valley Podcast to talk about cargo missions, and we had a couple different perspectives with Shane Kimbrough as an astronaut and also Dennis Leveson-Gower as a senior project scientist at NASA’s Ames Research Center in California. So if you want to want to check out all of NASA’s podcasts, just go to nasa.gov/podcasts. There’s where you can sign up for the NASA in Silicon Valley Podcast and subscribe to them, and there’s also a new one that just got released – last week I think at this point – called Gravity Assist and it’s hosted by Dr. Jim Green, NASA’s Director of Planetary Scientist. It’ll start with a 10-part series where he starts with the Sun and then goes all the way out to Pluto and makes his stops all along our solar system and then talks about planets beyond. This is going to be a really good podcast, so definitely stay tuned.  We were talking about cargo missions, so definitely tune in to the live coverage of the launch and capture of SpaceX CRS-13. I think SpaceX covers the launch, but you can find the latest times for the capture on nasa.gov/NTV, as in NASA TV, and you can see the latest schedule for when we’re going to be broadcasting that.  Make sure to follow us on social media: Facebook, Twitter, Instagram. Make sure to use the hashtag #asknasa to submit an idea for the podcast, and make sure to mention it’s for Houston We Have a Podcast if you want it answered here.  This podcast was recorded on November 14, 2017. Thanks to Alex Perryman, John Stoll, Greg Wiseman, Kelly Humphries, Megan Sumner, and Brandi Dean from here in Houston. Thanks to Matt Buffington, Eric Land, Abby Tabor, and Frank Tavares from NASA’s Ames Research Center for teaming up for this podcast. And again thanks to Shane Kimbrough and Dennis Leveson-Gower for coming on the show. We’ll be back next week."

                        "description": "Gary Jordan (Host): Houston, we have a podcast! Welcome to the official podcast of the NASA Johnson Space Center, Episode 214, “Hispanic Heritage Month.” I'm Gary Jordan and I'll be host today. On this podcast, we bring in the experts, scientists, engineers, astronauts, all to let you know what's going on in the world of human spaceflight. NASA is committed to diversity, inclusion, and equal opportunity, where employees feel welcome, respected, connected, and engaged. I very much enjoy bringing on guests from a variety of backgrounds, and I like to not only dive deep into incredibly interesting topics but get a sense of these folks' backgrounds and what it took to land them where they are today. Many times on this podcast, we've highlighted different ethnicities, races, and genders to get their perspective. So, with this being National Hispanic Heritage Month here in the U.S., I wanted to bring on a few special guests from the Hispanic community. So, I worked with our Hispanic Employee Resource Group here at the Johnson Space Center to get us a couple of guests. So, joining us are George Salazar and Ana Guzman. George is a veteran of 38 years at NASA and has a wonderful story of getting to NASA and making a difference after struggling in high school. Ana came to work at NASA 13 years ago with a communications background. She's now using her knowledge and skills to help engage the Spanish-speaking community through communication efforts here at NASA. George and Ana give their perspectives on diversity and inclusion at NASA from the Hispanic community, and it was wonderful to get to chat with them. So, let's get right into it. Enjoy.  [ Music]  Host: George and Ana, thanks so much for coming on Houston, We Have a Podcast today.  George Salazar: Thank you for having me. I'm very happy to be here.  Ana Guzman: Great to be here, Gary.  Host: Yeah, yeah. This is going to be a great conversation. Happy Hispanic Heritage Month to both of you. And we have an employee resource group here, and I reached out to them to get both of your names and they, and they chose the both of you to come on the podcast today to, to celebrate this month. And I think it's because you each have very unique and interesting experiences here at NASA. It shows, it shows just the breadth of, of diversity that goes on here. And, and that's the conversation that I really wanted to get into today is understanding both of your contributions to the agency and really have an open conversation about celebrating culture in the workplace, diversity, inclusion. This is going to be great. I'm very excited. I want to start, though, by understanding a little bit more about each of you and your work so far. We'll take it all the way back to, you know, your individual biographies and, and other contributions to the agency. But, George, help kick us off by helping us understand exactly what you do now. What is your role at NASA and, and what are you doing?  George Salazar: I am currently the human computer interface technical discipline lead for the Johnson Space Center. So, in that capacity, I look at not just the hardware systems that are being designed for flight systems, but as well as the functionality of the human interface. And that includes imagery, displays and controls, lighting, audio, as well as wearable technology. I have to say right now that my, two of my key roles are in two major programs. One is the Commercial Crew Program, I’m the SpaceX displacement control subsystem manager, and just recently I was knighted the human lander system computer human interface system manager.  Host: Wow, OK, so you are, you are the person that is helping to make these interfaces, I guess, maybe user-friendly is the right term to use, for Commercial Crew vehicles -- that's the SpaceX Dragon, the Boeing Starliner -- and then the upcoming lunar landers that we're going to be working with. So, you're the guy.  George Salazar: That's correct.   Host: Very cool. So, what does that take to, to make it, I hope I'm using this term right, is, is user-friendly. What all does that encompass? What is your, what exactly do you do to help to make these interfaces user-friendly?  George Salazar: Well, actually, there's a couple of things. One is associated with the reliability of the system, and that encompasses, you know, doing the proper testing to make sure that the hardware as well as software is going to operate properly, especially in the radiation environment that the NASA programs, obviously, that we are pursuing, like, for example, Artemis on the Moon and beyond is going to encounter. And then secondly, is working with our human factors folks in ensuring that the usability as well as the workload does not cause problems associated with what the term used is human error. So, in combination with those two, we try to make it user-friendly; make it reliable and then, secondly, make it, as you say, user-friendly. We call it, maybe call it usability and reduction in workload.  Host: Interesting. OK. And that reliability sounds like it's a very important factor as well. So, awesome. Great description, George. Glad, glad to have you on. I'm going to move over to Ana. Ana, tell us a little bit about your role here at NASA.  Ana Guzman: Yeah, I work as the research integration specialist at the International Space Station's Program Research Office. I work with the communications team in four different areas. I do a bit of web editing in their research and technologies web pages under NASA.gov. I also do some writing, summarizing research results, publications from payloads that were previously on ISS: researchers and scientists, they publish their results, we get the papers, we summarize them, and we publish them so the public can get a little bit of an overview of what the experiment entailed and what the results were. I also support the ARISS (Amateur Radio on the International Space Station) ham radio payload. This is more of a like a STEM (science, technology, engineering and math) engagement effort where amateur radio operators set up events where kids and students all over the world can communicate with the astronauts via ham radio. So, it's very exciting to see the kids' faces, it's very inspiring. The kids absolutely love talking to the astronauts. And finally, I also support the Spanish engagement efforts on behalf of Johnson Space Center. We translate many articles and videos that already come out in English, and we published it in Ciencia.NASA.gov, and we are also on different social media platforms, so we can educate and inform the Hispanic community of what's going on with the space station.  Host: All very important work, Ana. So, it sounds like it's all facing outwards, right? Everything you're doing is, is taking all the great work that we're doing and then turning it into a story so that the general public can understand in one way or another, whether it's through radio, whether it's in the Spanish language, the English language, and, of course, these, a lot of the research. I work with the research office as well. I've transitioned a little bit away from it recently, but I, but I do like those people a lot. They, they are fantastic folks to work with. And one thing that I think is absolutely fascinating is just how much that there is. And, and it sounds like that's probably a big part of your role is I don't think folks probably understand is just the quantity of experiments that are on station --  Ana Guzman: Yes.  Host: -- and how often these research stories are coming out. And I'm sure that's a big workload for you.  Ana Guzman: Yes. Yes. We do not have a dull day in our office. There's always something going on. There's different teams within communications over there. There's a group of people that also are communicating what is about to be on board space station, you know, what's about to launch. For instance, this Saturday on SpaceX, all the science that is launching, they're in charge of informing the media, you know, what's going on, what experiments are going to be there. And, yeah, it's, it's beginning to end, all the way from the time of, that the researchers bring their experiments to NASA all the way to the end. We follow up with them when the results are finally published. We continue communicating with them to make sure if they were happy with the process, what worked, what didn't, what they enjoyed. And, of course, we always want them to come back.  Host: Yeah, absolutely. And it seems like it's, it's in high demand, right? There's a lot going on. And, and I know you guys put a lot of hard work into sharing all that research that's going up on different cargo vehicles because that's, it takes up a lot of space on those vehicles and, which is fantastic. That means that it's, it's in high demand. So that's great.  Ana Guzman: For sure.  Host: Yeah, absolutely. Both of you contributing fantastic stuff to the agency. This for Hispanic Heritage Month, though, I want to dive deeper into your biographies. I think each of you have very interesting stories to tell into how you got to NASA and other stuff that you've been doing. George, I'm going to pass it over to you. Tell us about your early childhood and growing up and eventually just getting us to the path that eventually led you to NASA.  George Salazar: Well, hopefully there's enough time. I have to say that, I have to say that, you know, sometimes I tell students that for some folks, going from Point A to Point B is a straight line. For me, it was jaggedy as the name goes. I'm originally, again, from Corpus Christi, which is, for those folks that are not familiar with where Corpus Christi is at, and it's about 180 miles south of Houston. I am the product of the barrios of a Corpus Christi. My grandparents had no education. My parents, my dad, had a fourth-grade education, my mom had a second-grade education. In fact, she was an orphan at the age of ten. But I have to say that between my grandparents and my parents, they instilled a very strong work ethic and responsibility growing up in the, in the barrio. I have to say that also, not too far from where I grew up, it was actually called a shotgun house, which was not a very big house, roughly about 12-feet wide by 30-feet deep. The place that I used to visit quite frequently with my friends was a junkyard, and that junkyard was a haven in learning in terms of what was out there. We, you know, we built a tree house. I learned how a toaster, or tried to learn how a toaster work. I got shocked in the process. But needless to say, it was a, it was a learning opportunity for me. I, you know, I was very inquisitive at a very young age. I, I also made my own, at the time that I was growing up, there was no there was no such thing as superheroes, so I actually took toy soldiers and using a little bit of bubblegum and glue, glue as well as paint, and I made my own superheroes: Batman, Superman, Wonder Woman. OK. So, one of the soldiers became a woman, so, you know, it was one of those strange things. But needless to say, I learned a lot about, you know, doing hands on as well as, I built my own models starting the age of five. So, I was very inquisitive. I always enjoyed that. I have to say that as well as growing up, that the work ethic, there was no such thing as what they call allowance. And so, I had my uncle build a shoeshine box, and I used to go shoe-shining back when gentleman wore shoes a lot, and they don't do that much often now. I, you know, made a few bucks out of that. So, to, to help me buy magazines, to help me buy materials for making my superheroes and my models. At the age of ten, my dad was able to buy a donut shop and again, because of the belief that there's no such thing as, as allowance, he put me to work, and at the age of ten, actually, he taught me how to make donuts. And actually it's very beneficial because I knew the business pretty well. At the age of 15, he suffered a heart attack and so, I had to take over the business while going to school. And it was, it was a little bit challenging. Needless to say, my, my schooling was not all that fantastic. I graduated 475 out of 605 out of my graduating class. And actually my counselor had recommended that I pursue becoming an auto mechanic at that time. About a year later, the Hurricane Celia devastated Corpus, and we moved to Houston. In Houston I worked various jobs. I did construction with my uncle, sold books door-to-door, went back to actually making donuts at Shipley's Do-Nuts here in Houston. I worked at Kmart in building materials. And I wanted to make a change. I saw that this was not going to be a future for me, and so, I tried going different routes. One was looking at being an electronics technician, so I applied at Xerox for electronics technician. And at that time, the digital electronics was pretty hot, so when I took the test, I looked at it without even knowing what I was going to get into. It was just, it was just foreign to me. Digital logic was something that I had no clue about. Needless to say, I failed that test, and then I tried IBM. IBM, I did quite well actually in the mechanical part, but did not do very well in the electrical part because their systems were rather complicated. I tried doing a, what they call technical college, radio and TV, and it just was not for me. About that time, I got married and laid low so to speak for, for about a year, but then wanted to return to school. And realizing that I had to take an SAT to try to get to college, I did, and failed miserably, but I didn't let that stop me. I actually found out that, you know, trying to go to a junior college was maybe another option. And so, I -- applied at a junior college, which at that time was called North Harris County Community College, and they took me on a probation basis because of my high school records. And they said you have to make an A or better in these 12 hours, or four classes. And so, I did. I actually, I, I excelled there. Within two years I got my degree in electronics technology and then transferred over to the University of Houston, where I first majored in technology but I wasn't happy with the -- what I was learning. And so, I came across a group that actually said, you know, we, you know, we can kind of help you navigate around the school. That was another challenge I had, going from a school of 4,000 to a school of 33,000 was rather a little bit overwhelming for me. But this, the group, helped me navigate and also said, hey George, do you want to challenge? Why don't you switch over to engineering? And so, I did. And, you know, the funny thing is, was a little bit scary, was that I had heard people were going from engineering to technology, and here I was going from technology to engineering. I was saying to myself, what am I getting into? Well, I, I got myself into a whole bunch of challenges, needless to say, but I have to say with a little bit of perseverance and determinism, I was able to make it. Now, during the time that I was going to school, I, I got a part time job as a radio technician at Canon Calculator, a repair technician, rather, at Canon Calculator, and I also had an opportunity to apply at NASA. This was my first opportunity to come work at NASA as a Pathway intern -- at that time they used to call it, I think it was called the Cooperative Education Program. Well, my GPA (grade point average) wasn't high enough. So, I kept applying and there was a company called GeoSource, which was seismic exploration, took me on as an electronics technician. So fast forward, when I was getting ready to graduate, NASA came to, to the university, and the only reason they came was because there were two cooperative education students that declined offers, and so they opened it up to the street. So, there was one opportunity for me to, rather there was one opportunity here at NASA in Houston, to apply. And I think there was another one on the East Coast. So, I was applying, and there were folks that I knew had a higher GPA than I did. My GPA was not all that fantastic. But Mr. Brown, who was the Crew and Thermal Systems branch chief, liked the fact that I had work experience. And he said, your GPA is OK, but we really like your work experience. So, I had an opportunity to, to do my second interview at the Tracking and Communications Division at the NASA Johnson Space Center with a gentleman, division chief, Mr. Ralph Sawyer. And for, for whatever reason, he wanted me to come work for him, and I told him I had some other offers. I, I have to say I was married at the time, I had a child, I was hungry for money, and so I was kind of looking for the highest bidder.  Host: Right.  George Salazar: But Ralph, but Ralph Sawyer insisted that, you know, he wanted me to come work at NASA. And so, he came, and he actually had the human resource lead come and talk to me. And in the end, I was convinced to come work at NASA, and I'm glad I did because it, it's been an incredible experience. So basically, that is my story, so to speak, of how I got to NASA. Again, not a straight line, but I'm glad I'm here.  Host: Unbelievable, George. I love your story so much, and you've been here a while, right? Like 38 years, I think it is?  George Salazar: Yes, sir.  Host: All right. That is fantastic. What I appreciate most about your story, George, is the hustle. There was, there was no point, it seems, since from when you were ten that you ever stopped. You were just go, go, go. And, and I think what I like most about your story is, is, in addition to the hustle, is that if you weren't happy, you worked even harder, it seems like to, to push yourself. So, you, you talked about from an early age that, that a strong work ethic was instilled in you. But, you know, that seemed to never die out, no matter what the struggle, no matter the obstacle. It seemed like you always kept pushing forward. What was always in the back of your mind that, that helped you to do that?  George Salazar: Well, I have to say that a couple of things. One of the things that I always thought about was the, you know, where I came from. You know, it's somewhat of a way of building a foundation of, of moving forward. You know, sometimes the, the saying goes that, you know, you, you advance forward by being on the shoulders of, of giants. And I have to say that the giants for me were, was my family, you know, and where they came from, and I wanted to improve that, in the back of my mind.  Host: That is incredible, George. I love your story so much. Ana, I want to hear from you too, because I think your story is, is a little bit different. So, so tell, tell us about your story, how you ended up at NASA.  Ana Guzman: Well, believe it or not, my road to NASA started before I was even born, and I didn't realize it until I finally got to NASA. [Laughter]  Host: Wow.  Ana Guzman: My parents immigrated from Cuba in 1968 to Miami, Florida. And right when they arrived was, it was during the ramp up of Apollo, and they were able to, you know, see it on TV and, and be involved in the excitement of us landing on the Moon. And ever since then, my parents have always been big fans of NASA and, and learning about space and, and, you know, advancing technology and whatnot. So, by the time I was born, you know, they, they had already included that in their new life in, in the U.S. So as I was growing up in Florida, we would visit Kennedy Space Center every once in a while, and we would get to see the rockets and the launch pads and all that. But at the time, you know, like everybody else, you think, well, I can't work at NASA. You know, I'm not a scientist or engineer. I'm not a genius. So as a child, I thought, oh, OK; well, I'm good at math and science, but I'm not that smart. So I would just admire the launches, and where I grew up down in Homestead, Florida, which is about 40, 40 miles south of Miami, there was one night that my dad took me out into our neighborhood, and Homestead is, I don't know, about a couple hundred miles away from KSC, and at night we were able to see a shuttle launch. We were able to see the long fire come up in, in the blackness of the sky, so it, it was amazing to see. But my childhood in some ways is similar to George's. My parents’ education wasn't that far along. My dad had a fourth-grade education, my mom had an eighth-grade education. And only Spanish was spoken at home. They did not know English, or very little. They were both very good at math, and they were able to help me with math homework. But when it came to English and, and other subjects, I was blessed to have a godmother in the family who had come to the country many years before my parents, and her English was really good. So, during my grade school years, it was a bit of a struggle, you know, to, to get, you know, to get that A or B and, you know, understand the courses. So by the time I was in junior high, though, I was able to handle my homework and whatnot. But my parents, also just like George's parents, instilled a good, solid work ethic in me. And quite often they would emphasize the importance of education, and they would tell me stories of their struggles and challenges in Cuba, you know, because they – lived, a lot of people in Cuba live in poverty; there's not a lot of freedom to, you know, pursue things that you would like in your life. So, you know, they would remind me, we came here so you can have a better life. So that was very inspiring and very motivational for me. So, I continued on in school, and I ended up going into honors classes. Math and science were my strong subjects. I did go all the way up to pre-cal[culus], but that was it. That was my limit. And when I went to college I started as a business major. But then I started taking accounting courses, and I was, I was thinking, OK, this is way too boring, I can't do this. So, I took a break, and I worked some full-time jobs and whatnot, and I finally decided to go back to school. And I remember taking a few courses in high school in TV production and in yearbook. And there was something there, you know, a passion, a joy of working in that. So, I went back for my bachelor's and got a bachelor's in communications with a concentration in TV and video production from Florida International University down there in Miami. So, I started on, off on that career, and I worked in film and video production for quite a while. And then, when I moved out here to Houston, life brought me here, late 2000, and I started looking around for jobs and I found out that JSC has a television operations department and I said, well, let me try and apply. And by February 2008 I had come to NASA and I started as a mission video console operator, which, the primary job was to archive video downlink coming down from space shuttle and the space station. I was in awe. It was never a dull day. And I -- it's, to this day it feels so, it -- feels like such an accomplishment to be able to be part of a community that makes history happen every single day. Every single day that we are flying in space and doing science, we're, we're making history and, and, it, it really feels good to be a part of that.  Host: Yeah, I, what I like about both of your stories is it seems like once you got to NASA, like you, you stayed here. And so, I'm interested to, to dive into the NASA culture to understand more about that. But Ana, I want to pose that same question that I asked George to you, because it was the same thing. It wasn't, you didn't have an easy path to NASA by, by any chance. You know, it was, it was, it was work and you had to hustle, and you had to push yourself to get to, to where you are. So, what was that, what was that thing in the back of your head driving you? Maybe it was that, that early adoption of a love for space that that drove you this way. But what was it in the back of your mind that pushed you to, to keep going and pursue what you love?  Ana Guzman: Well, Gary, I seem to have the personality that I cannot remain stagnant too long. I need to be challenged. I need to, to learn something new. And what better place than NASA to do that. There is always innovation and there's always advancement in technology. There's always something new going on, and that is definitely a motivational factor. And of course, I have my dad's voice in the back of my head saying, I didn't come to this country for you to do nothing [laughter]. I want you to advance, I want you to progress, I want you to do everything you dreamed of. So yeah, definitely. I owe it to my, to my parents as well.  Host: Wonderful. And it seems that's the same for both of you, right? You both had parents that, that pushed you to, to because they wanted you to succeed. And that's, that's absolutely wonderful. George, I'm going to go over to you because we left, when we left off with your story, you had just started at NASA and as we mentioned, you have been at NASA for quite some time. So, I want to understand more about, you know, starting from the very beginning, day one, what was some of the stuff that you had someone that really wanted you to come on board, so I'm interested to see where you started and then what led you to your current position in human computer interface?  George Salazar: Oh, OK. Well, so I first started out in what was called the telemetry and audio section at, at, in the Tracking and Communications Division, which is now the Avionics Systems Division. So originally it started with the Space Shuttle Program, and right off the bat, I have to say that my section chief, Mr. [Richard] Sinderson, saw, I guess, a lot of maturity in myself and, and my ability to, let's say, take on challenges because very, at the very, I have to say, within six months, I was already challenged with taking on the responsibility of supporting the space shuttle module auxiliary data systems subsystem manager. When he left about a year later, I took over that job, but along the same lines, I was also becoming responsible for a speech recognition of the closed-circuit television camera systems on the space shuttle. And I have to, again, I have to give credit to my division management that, that, they, they had confidence in me that I could do it. And so, I took over that project. And so, I, it was my first project in NASA that I was the lead. And here I was, and not only designing part of the system, but also, I was the project manager, I was a systems engineer, I was learning by the seat of my pants on a day-to-day basis. But in, in the end, I was very fortunate that the -- speech control, well it was called voice command system on STS-41, this system was used by Bruce Melnick and Captain Bill Shepherd, was very successful. And so I, you know, that was kind of like the launching board for a lot of other things that I came aboard. I -- became responsible for the X-38 spacecraft vehicle flight computer systems. I also was involved with a cockpit avionics upgrade of the space shuttle display systems. I went on to work space station. I went on to work, at that time, the Constellation Program, and I guess eventually, leading me to where I am right now. So, over the years I became very proficient in hardware, software system design for flight systems, certification of flight systems, and just recently in the last ten years became somewhat learning, on, on my own about the human element of system development. I was not only involved with establishing the, actually the Hispanic Employee Resource Group and getting that established officially at NASA Johnson Space Center, but also I was the developer, or rather the, the co-chair, if you will, founding father, of the Employee Resource Group Human Systems Integration, which is the only technical employee resource group at the NASA Johnson Space Center. But I saw the importance of the, of the human element in developing systems and not just thinking about hardware and software.   Host: Oh, I am very interested to talk about that, George, the, the inception of employee resource groups and the logic behind that. I want to, I want to first start with your, with your progression, though. It seems like if I understand it correctly, your, your career progression is taking on new challenges and constantly learning, learning, learning. And you even mentioned even, even now, later in your career, you're still, you're still learning. I wonder, you know what, what helped you to, to keep doing that, to learn new things rather than just sort of sit in the same place and become a resident expert? But in the same vein, I want to add on to that question is, do you find yourself in a position now where you have people coming to you because you have so much diverse expertise that maybe they come to you for advice?  George Salazar: Yes, they do. And --  Host: Awesome. Awesome. Yeah. Go ahead, please, please expand.  George Salazar: Oh, I was just going to say in terms of knowledge, I have to say, I think I heard Ana talk about not staying stagnant and I'm the same way.  Host: Yeah.  George Salazar: I tell students, I tell students, because I do quite a bit of outreach with students, is that if I haven't learned something new in one day, I wasted my time. There's so much to learn and so little time. And so, every minute to me means a lot, in terms of gaining knowledge and understanding of things that I still need to learn.  Host: And how about, and how about you as a, do, do you find yourself in a mentor role every once in a while, where, because of your diverse experience, you know, all that hard work that you put in towards, you know, pushing yourself and even, even not having a hard, a high GPA, but, but you just kept pushing and pushing it, and now people are coming to you for your expertise? How does that feel?  George Salazar: I – I mean, I feel very fortunate. I mean, I feel very humble about it. I never thought I was ever end up in this situation, you know, coming back from the, you know, I guess going back and thinking about coming from the barrios of Corpus to where I am right now. But I have to say that now in my later years, being a mentor to students is very important to me. I’ve been doing mentorships for, now for, for many years, outreach to students; along the way I've earned a couple of awards, a couple of, actually a couple of words that I'm very proud of. One being the Lifetime Achievement Award for Great Minds in STEM, as well as the John F. Kennedy Astronautics Award for being an ambassador for NASA. So, I'm, I'm very proud of what I've achieved, and more so that I'm helping students. That's, that's the bottom line for me,  Host: Passing on the, the expertise and pushing them to do what you did, which was to push yourself, and hopefully they do the same. That's wonderful stuff, George. Ana, I want to know about your career. It started off very interesting, you're getting these amazing views from space. That's the first thing that you get to experience, and I wonder how it progressed from there.  Ana Guzman: Well, first, Gary, I got to say George is a tough act to follow. What an amazing career.  [ Laughter]  Host: Yeah. Unbelievable.   Ana Guzman: Yeah, when I started in 2008, and I could just stare at the screens and see Earth spinning below, I was a big fan of geography when I was in school, so, you know, when I was working the night shift and bored out of my mind, I would just stare at the, at the views of Earth and kind of guess where on Earth that was, type of thing. But yeah, NASA has been a, a good experience and a good working place for advancement. I was fortunate that within my department I had a supervisor and a manager that were good at seeing employees that were eager to learn more, to do more. And, and I was promoted, you know, every year, year-and-a-half I would get promoted, and it would be great. You know, I started as a console operator, and then I ended up being a Johnson TV operator, which is the, the equivalent to a control room operator in a news station. I would get, route, I would get signals, video signals, from Russia, other NASA centers, and I would send video signals out to other agencies, and the downlink signals I would send over there to your counterparts over there, Gary, in Building 2 at PAO (public affairs office) so they can do their live television broadcasts. And then later on, I got promoted to lead and production coordinator over the video production side of the house in the operations department. And that was a lot of fun because I got to interact with people at the public affairs office, but also, we started collaborating more with outside media outlets and filmmakers. We did a live show with Nat[ional] Geo[graphic] once where they came onboard the space station and they did a live Q&A with the space station. We also have done projects with Discovery Channel and Time Magazine. It just continues to go on. Once one does it, everybody's interested. And of course, you know, we all want for the, the story of space station and for NASA to be out there. So, we were more than eager to help out in getting the story out. So I organized the projects within NASA to get footage out to these entities. I also worked with people within NASA, like in the Engineering Department and the Human Health and Performance Department, to produce videos for them, whether it, whether it be for training, to train their own employees, or simply for public-facing purposes or something that would be going out on NASA TV or social media to inform the public of different projects they were working on. Later on I did work within what was once known as the Education Office, is now known as STEM Engagement Office. We worked with minority students doing outreach, going to different conferences where these minority students, college graduates, would visit the NASA booth, excited and starry-eyed, wondering, how do I get to NASA, how do I get an internship to NASA. So it was very inspiring and exciting to see that eagerness and the, the excitement behind those students' eyes of wanting to be a part of this and, and in talking to them and, and giving them pointers and, and letting them know how to kind of maneuver their way around the career, or starting their career, or getting into NASA. And then now with the Program Research Office, now I have the opportunity to help NASA with Spanish engagement with the general public to, because, for instance, you know, immigrants that are coming over now, it's a similar situation to what I was in. You know, their parents only know Spanish, and the kids are just starting to know, get to know English. So to have this type of content available to them that they both can share and learn from is a good thing, you know? And what better thing about, than space or STEM-related subjects, to motivate students to learn the language and to learn certain subjects? It, you know, I think it's a, it's a great thing, and I'm very happy to be a part of it.  Host: You know, it seems like, Ana, throughout your career, you always played some role in sharing the story, right? But it seems like from, you, you started from behind the scenes and, at least the way I interpreted it, and I, and I don't know if this is completely true, so please correct me, is it seemed like once you started to have that interface with the public one-on-one and see the excitement and understand the, the, there were there was a drive from, from kids that wanted to do what you did.  Ana Guzman: Yeah.  Host: I wonder if you saw something of yourself in them that helped you to keep going because it seemed like from there you started doing more and more projects that were reaching out to the community involving the Spanish-speaking audience, seem like you, you ended up in that path, and I wonder if there was, there was, you were inspired in part by seeing the, the end customer, if you will, of some of the public products.  Ana Guzman: Yeah, certainly. And you know, it's paying it forward. You know, I see me in them. You know, I remember being their age and not knowing or being sure of what I wanted to do in life, and for them to have somebody that looks like them, you know, tell them, hey, you can do it! You know, you're, you, all you got to do is put your mind to it. You know, you've got to dedicate the time to it. And they can do it. And, yeah, I really enjoy doing that. And I do see that, that excitement now on our social media platforms for NASA en Español. There is a lot of engagement there, a lot of comments of interest from the kids and the, and the public in general, the Hispanic market here in, in the United States as well, eager, asking for more information and asking for follow up: oh, where did this experiment end up, oh, we're looking forward to seeing the results. So, it, it is definitely very inspiring and satisfying to see that our effort is, are well received and, and it's making change.  Host: Absolutely. Yeah. And it's all thanks to you, to your work. Both of you have such fantastic stories coming to NASA and even at NASA, just a very round experience. And I want to transition from Ana's experience talking with the Spanish community outside of NASA, and I want to, and I want to go to inside of NASA. Now, George, you mentioned when, in your career, that you helped to establish the Hispanic Employee Resource Group. Give us an understanding of the early culture of, of NASA in your career, you know, what it was like as a Hispanic person here, and then what inspired you, transitioning from that, to what inspired you to push for, you know what, we need, we need a place where the Hispanic community can gather inside of NASA and work together and bring that community together. So, so please, starting, starting there, what it was like at NASA for the Hispanic community.  George Salazar: Well, back when I first started NASA, there was an organization called the [Equal Employment Opportunity office], and it was headed by a lady that I became friends with. At that time, the, that was basically where, you know, what, what is now the different ERGs basically was the focal point for coordinating activities, whether Asia or Hispanic or Afro-American or what have you. But then, when there was an opportunity to, to form employee resource groups, more so for affinity, I thought it was a good opportunity to, to get involved in forming the Hispanic Employee Resource Group and make it a little bit more formal process. I have to say the employee opportunity organization was somewhat informal, so the Hispanic Employee Resource Group actually made it more formal and recognized. And, and so, I was very pleased and, and proud to participate in that. I have to say that, that with the, with NASA backing, I say, NASA Johnson Space Center backing, the employee resource groups we had more clout in terms of participating in outreach activities like the Hispanic, Houston Hispanic Forum, which brings in over 16,000, 17,000 students to the George R. Brown Convention Center.  Host: Wow.  George Salazar: This is pre-pandemic.  Host: Yeah, right, right. [laughter]  George Salazar: But, but, you know, doing a lot of outreach activities, you know, for, you know, to, to try to inspire Hispanics primarily to, you know, to pursue a, a career in STEM. And again, I – I use my story: if I can do it, you can do it too. It just takes determination and hard work. You know, don't let the grades set you back. I, I tell students that grades don't make the person. It's determination and hard work that does. And I think I'm an example of that. So, the Hispanic Employee Resource Group is a great opportunity for, you know, to being a, an outlet, if you will, of, of providing opportunities to, to outreach to, to disadvantaged, economic, especially economically disadvantaged students in the Hispanic community.   Host: Wonderful. And, and you also said that you helped with, with another employee resource group, which is a technical one, human systems integration. So, which, which one is that all about?  George Salazar: Yeah, that was a, that was the little one that was hard to, to sell initially at that time. Michael Coats was the, the center director, but the word was, well, wait a minute, you know, these employee resource groups are associated with affinity, he said, and this one is more technical. And, and the reason for that was because I was starting to establish a collaboration, if you will, and rapport with our fellow folks in the human habitability directorate, in terms of understanding the human element in developing systems. And one of the things that I found through some of the work that I was looking at and as well as talking to the folks in human factors, was that there was a lack of understanding about the human element in engineering. I can, I can vouch for this is that in engineering, you know, we're taught about building the best hardware, the best software systems, and you can make them deterministic because, you know, the person designs to make them operate how they're supposed to. But the human is not like that. The human is not very deterministic. And, and so, yeah, you're trying to design a system that's deterministic with a system for the human that's non-deterministic. And that's where the, the mismatch happens. And that's why you hear about human error, airplane crashes, ship crashes like not too long ago the USS [John S.] McCain colliding with another vehicle, with another vessel, and killing five sailors. And it was associated with a human interface and the lack of understanding of how to operate that system, especially in critical events. And so all this came to, to a head, so to speak, and said, this is an opportunity for us to try and instill more of human systems integration into the NASA culture. And so myself and four other people basically formed the HSI ERG to get the word out and infuse the human systems integration into the NASA development process. And I'm very proud to say that at this point in time, you know, we've, we've actually infused human systems integration requirements into like, for example, the 7123 NPR (NASA Procedural Requirements) NASA Systems Engineer Procedural document. We just recently, I was part of the group that wrote the Human Systems Integration Handbook, as well as updating the NASA Systems Engineering Handbook and including more of human systems integration into the design and development of systems. So, I'm very proud of that. But it's, it, it was not necessarily associated with affinity, but rather the technical need for, for NASA to, I say, let's call it to grow and learn and understand more about the human element, even though NASA has always done human element design since the Mercury program. But it's more to, to further that knowledge.  Host: Very interesting. Yeah, and, and it's, it's all part it seems like about having, having these conversations that say this is why this is important. And then it seems like this group is getting together and injecting themselves into procedures, into handbooks, and that's, and that's important to make sure that, that these, that these conversations are had, that these perspectives are, are received. And so, I want to move from there to over to Ana because I wonder, building off of George's description of, of, you know, building an employee resource group and even, even with this technical workforce, getting together and injecting themselves as part of the conversation, your, your career progression was, you know, you -- moved around a lot, you were pursuing a lot, but I wonder what it was like inside of NASA, as a Hispanic person? What were you doing to overcome perhaps some biases or challenges to, to have difficult conversations to, to be a part of the community, if that was necessary? And why do you think that's important to make sure that we're having these conversations internally?  Ana Guzman: I took it as a challenge and proved them wrong.  Host: Yeah.  Ana Guzman: All kidding aside, no, in my industry, in the media industry, and a little bit at NASA, not too much, I had challenges more as a result of being a woman than a Hispanic.  Host: Interesting.  Ana Guzman: Since it's a highly technical environment and it was predominantly male.  Host: Yeah. Yeah.  Ana Guzman: But fortunately for me, as, as you know, the stereotype, it, it stands true: Cuban women are very strong headed, strong charactered women. [laughter] So, I tend to brush it off and, and prove them wrong.  Host: Good.  Ana Guzman: So, I hustled. I learned things as fast as I could, and I proved that I could do the job. But, in general, as far as NASA goes, really, it has been a great environment to work in. I, I haven't struggled in that way of things. In other areas of my career prior to NASA, yes, there has been some challenges, but it's, you got to see, you got to understand where the person's coming from and where they're getting their information as to why they said or acted the way they did towards you. You know, we all live in a bubble, especially now during COVID. We're all living in our homes. We don't have enough interaction, personal interaction with other people. I mean, like when I moved here in Houston, I've met several people in general outside of NASA that have told me, wow, I have never met a Cuban person before. You know, so that's where, where there's, you know, the importance of having diversity in the workplace and diversity in other areas of life, is to give people the opportunity to have the experience of socializing and communicating and working side to side with someone who looks different than you. It's, it's that's the way to do it. You know, we need to approach things with kindness and, and open mind. And it's a two-way street as well. You know, we have to come into it and say, yeah, I'm different than you, but guess what? I can do the job just as good or maybe even better than you, you know?  Host: Awesome.  Ana Guzman: So that, that's how I've approached things.  Host: Wonderful, wonderful. And now, George, same question to you because and I'm, I'm particularly interested in after the employee resource groups that you mentioned were established, because I think part of that is, is engaging in a conversation, right? And so I wonder after they were established, if maybe you saw a shift in natural NASA culture and especially if, if it was successful, why it is important to continue these conversations to raise awareness and, and involve more people in the community and be one big NASA family.  George Salazar: I have to say that I can't say there was a shift --  Host: Oh, OK.  George Salazar: -- after the Hispanic Employee Resource Group was established. I personally, I have to say that NASA has always been very good in, in providing opportunities. I have to say that I'm very fortunate to be working at NASA. And I tell students that NASA gave me the opportunity, despite my low GPA, to, you know, to come here and work. They provided me the opportunity to take on major challenges. And, and so I have to say, from the standpoint of inclusion and diversity, NASA has always been very good to me. I also, from the standpoint of the employee resource group, I still think it's important to have these groups here, especially for newcomers that perhaps are not familiar with the culture at NASA. I have to say that the culture is just not necessarily associated with, you know, ethnic and all that, but it's the culture of how things are operating from our organizational standpoint.  Host: Ah-ha. Yeah.  George Salazar: Case in point was that when I used to, when I was in module auxiliary data system subsystem manager, early on, I learned that during some of the program requirements review boards, that you, you were only allowed to sit at the front table if you were a certain person, and everybody else sits in the back. And I learned that the hard way because I sat, I sat, I sat up on the desk and they said --  Ana Guzman: I would have done that too. [laughter]  Host: Yeah, yeah, I've made that mistake too. I think we all have. Like, whoops, that seat is not for me.  George Salazar: Yeah. They tell me, what's your responsibility? Well, I'm, you know, I'm the SSM for the MADS system. Well, you shouldn't be sitting up here, you're supposed to be sitting in the back. OK. All right. Well, you know, there was just – [laughter]  Host: Right.  George Salazar: That was just a separation, if you will, of, you know, responsibility and your title and all that. But I do have to say from the standpoint also, in terms of, let's call it the conversation that should continue and diversity inclusion, I have to say that, and I think I'll echo Ana mentioned this to some extent, was that, you know, we, you know, we have, everybody has a different, everybody brings to the table different strengths and, and capabilities. And I had a branch chief many, many years ago, and you know, I have to say, he was probably ahead of his time because he told me that, of course, he was, he was from Alabama, and he had a southern accent, and he said, George, if you got six people that all think alike, you got five people that are not needed.  Ana Guzman: I actually have a good example for having these conversations.  Host: Yeah.  Ana Guzman: When I used to work in Building 8 in television operations during the fall for about a month, every Thursday, I would tell everybody to bring in, we would have a potluck, and we would sign up a sheet for whatever Thursday they wanted to bring in a traditional food from their family or their culture. And I opened it up to everybody. We had people who were Cajun, Mexican, there were people with an Irish background, and English, German background, Italian background. We had everything in that building.  And we would bring the food and we'd come into our, the room where I, where I used to manage the facility, we’d lay out all the food, and we would start, you know, chatting and eating. And you know how, how food is great for social interaction, right? And we would all start talking about our families, and traditions during the holidays, and mom fighting with the kids because we wanted to stick our hands in the pot first -- all those stories we, we would share, and you would see that there was so much more in common and so many similarities amongst us, even though we were coming from different walks of life. And I think that, opening that avenue for conversation and kind of making people feel comfortable and, and ease up and free to speak with each other and share our cultures, I think is a good way for improvement with relations, with whatever it has to do with, ethnicities or races or whatnot.  Host: Wonderful, wonderful. I want to end on, on this note because we're talking about the, the NASA on the inside, especially opening up these conversations, but both of you in your own respective ways have been involved with reaching outside of NASA and working with students and talk, telling your stories and, and trying to reach out to them in various ways. I want to know from each of you, Ana, we'll start with you, the importance of engaging the Hispanic community, the Spanish-speaking audience and students alike who, who may not think that that they can get to NASA, or that they can accomplish their dreams, and try to convince them otherwise the, the importance of doing so?  Ana Guzman: Well, I could start with the census results that just came out a few weeks ago. It stated that the Hispanic population grew 23% since 2010 --  Host: Wow.  Ana Guzman: -- to 62 million people. That is a large chunk of American residency or citizenship. You know, our, our, the United States is indeed a melting pot, and that is a good portion of the public that we need to reach out to and inspire. And we're seeing it. Like the Twitter channel that we have, NASA en Español, is about to reach one million followers. We have half a million followers on Instagram and, and Facebook. So, there is a need there that we are trying to reach out to. And, like I said before, you know, we're in a time where immigrants are kind of in between, you know? They have families that just immigrated that don't know English well. You have children coming into school that might need help, and something like this can help them learn the subjects. It can help them learn the language and, you know, be a thriving and successful part of our society here. So that, that's what I think is important. And NASA is going to continue, from my understanding, is going to continue growing that, that portion of the communications department from headquarters and amongst all the centers. It keeps growing, all of our efforts and all the products that we publish.  Host: Wonderful. George, same question to you. I know you, you're involved with students and you tell them your story. You said, if I can do it, you can do it. The importance of continuing that conversation and continuing to inspire the inspire the next generation.  George Salazar: Oh, absolutely. You know, Ana brought up the statistics about, you know, the Hispanic growing population, and one of the things that it tells some of the students that I talked to is that it's great that, you know, we're growing, but there's also a responsibility associated with that in terms of education and keeping America strong. And, you know, not only taking off technologically, but, you know, military, and of course, you know, there's obviously pros and cons about the military might, if you will, but be that as it may, in order to keep America strong, you know, we need, we need a very strong technical workforce savvy. So, having conversations with students from through Hispanic ERG or whatever, it is important and it's very important to me. I also have to say that I've kind of gone beyond, you know, I reach out to students, but I've also reached out to students from other countries. So, I, you know, I remember the line that's in one of the songs John Lennon wrote many years ago called, I guess “Beautiful Boy.” And it says, “life is what happens to you while you're busy making other plans.” And so here I am, you know, doing Hispanic outreach, and all of a sudden, I get involved with students from India, students from Africa, students from Australia, students from South America, students from Mexico. And so, I've been doing outreach activities and helping, and trying to inspire them to be the best they can. A lot of them want to come work for NASA, that's a challenge, but I, you know, I tell them, you know, you can get, you know, you can get to NASA. It just takes a little bit more effort than if you were a U.S. citizen. But this is what I enjoy. This is, this is what I, you know, in my later years here is trying to help students, I have to say, regardless of, you know, the race, color or whatever is to, you know, be the best they can be.  Ana Guzman: Yeah.  Host: So important, so important from the both of you. Unbelievable. This was, this was such a good conversation. Thank you to, to George and Ana for coming on and sharing your, your stories in detail and your work at NASA. And then I think ending with these, you know, talking about the conversations being had and, and reaching out and inspiring the next generation. I think that's just a wonderful place to end. So, so to both of you, thank you for coming on Houston We have a Podcast. I very much appreciate your time.  Ana Guzman: Thanks for giving us the opportunity, Gary.  George Salazar: Absolutely. Thank you for having us.  [ Music]  Host: Hey, thanks for sticking around! I had such a great conversation with George and Ana today. They shared their stories and we got an inside peek of what it took to get them to NASA and all of their incredible work. So, it was such a pleasure to talk to both of them today.

                        "description": "Gary Jordan (Host): Houston, we have a podcast! Welcome to the official podcast of the NASA Johnson Space Center, Episode 219, “The Crew-3 Astronauts.” I'm Gary Jordan and I'll be your host today. On this podcast we bring in the experts, scientists, engineers and astronauts all to let you know what's going on in the world of human spaceflight. Four astronauts are ready to launch from American soil on board the SpaceX Crew Dragon for the third crew rotation mission and the fourth crewed mission with SpaceX. On board are NASA astronauts Raja Chari, Tom Marshburn, and Kayla Barron, as well as Matthias Maurer of ESA, or the European Space Agency. On this episode we're going to hear from each member of the crew and learn a little bit more about them and what they think about their mission. You'll get to hear about their careers, their family, stories of their training, and you'll hear their thoughts about the importance of the mission that they're on, as well as the thoughts on their crewmates. They were a great group to interview, and they had a lot of energy and excitement. And even though three of the four of them will be first-time flyers, you'll learn quickly that they have a lot to bring to the table. So here we go: the Crew-3 astronauts Raja Chari, Tom Marshburn, Kayla Barron and Matthias Maurer. Enjoy.  [ Music]  Host: First up is NASA astronaut Raja Chari, commander of the Crew Dragon Endurance and the Crew-3 mission. Chari is responsible for all phases of flight from launch to re-entry. Once on board station, he'll serve as an Expedition 66 flight engineer. He was born in Milwaukee but considers Cedar Falls, Iowa, his hometown. He's a colonel in the U.S. Air Force and joins the mission with extensive experience as a test pilot. Over his career, he's accumulated more than 2,500 hours of flight time. This will be the first spaceflight for Chari, who became a NASA astronaut in 2017, and he's also a member of the Artemis Team, so, he's eligible for an assignment to a future lunar mission. Really enjoyed this conversation. So here's a little bit more about Raja Chari.  Host: Raja Chari, thanks so much for coming on Houston We Have a Podcast.  Raja Chari: Thanks. Happy to be here and we get to talk about the Crew-3 mission.  Host: Yeah, yeah. It's coming right up. Not, not too far until you actually launch. How you feeling?  Raja Chari: I'm feeling pretty good. It's kind of surreal knowing that as we do some of these trips to SpaceX or different training locations, knowing that this is my second to the last trip here. This is, it is, yeah. We're counting down, to use a really bad pun.  Host: Wow. So, so after this, so you're at Johnson Space Center now. You go to Johnson Space Center one more time, and then really, it's, you're, you're getting ready for the mission.  Raja Chari: Yeah. Yep. We've got yeah two more trips to Hawthorne, and more trip to the Cape. And yeah, we're pretty much in the final stages.  Host: Wow. All right. Well I want to take this time to get to know a little bit more about you. You grew up in is it Cedar Falls, Iowa?  Raja Chari: Yep. Yeah, so I was born in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. But then moved to Cedar Falls really shortly after I was born because my dad got a job there. And then, yeah, grew up in Cedar Falls, Iowa.  Host: Cool. What was it like?  Raja Chari: It was a mix of a small town and a big city by at least by Iowa standards. So definitely not a, not a farm but also, still had that feeling of, you know, where the community was tight enough to know, you know, people knew each other whether it's through church or school, but not in a creepy way, but in the way there, where people were interested in your success, whether it was teachers or, you know, other parents. Everyone had an interest in, you know, the kids succeeding and doing well.  Host: Yeah. Was there some moment or some series of maybe classes or something that really got you interested in engineering or science kind of field?  Raja Chari: Yeah. So I went to a place called St. Patrick's School. And I think at some point in, you know I, I do have one memory of, you know, getting new tables and new equipment in the science lab there. And that struck, you know, sticks out in my mind. But I think just, you know, I was also, you know, I enjoyed doing math at the time. And so I think both those things were kind of a push towards the engineering direction. And I think, you know, my mom has pointed out that I always, always enjoyed space. I made little, you know, little spaceships out of random metal pieces around the house and would try construct, you know, little airplanes or spaceships. And then try to sell them, you know, kind of lemonade style stand on the curb. I think only my parents bought them from me. But so, some early things like that.  Host: So what, what was the inspiration for going the military route?  Raja Chari: For me it was the idea of, well, twofold. One, I really, I liked the idea of trying to fly. I think really the, the military piece of that, though, was, you know, I definitely had a, I wouldn't been able to put my finger on it I don't think as distinctly until I was more in my 20s. Looking back it's really clear. But I had somewhere this innate, I don't know desire or thought that I had to give back, that I had to serve. And I think it came from, well, I don't think, I know, it came from now, my dad’s upbringing and sort of his background, his journey of coming to the U.S. as an immigrant and, you know, and working his way up, making a job at a place for himself in a new country after, you know, when I reflect on it, it was a hugely risky move for him to come start completely over in a new country. And I think, but the fact that that was something you could do really made me think that was those kind of values and the idea of having a country and a culture where you could do that, was worth, was worth fighting for and preserving. And so, I think that was really the reason that the military route appealed to me, of doing something where I felt like I could give back what I felt I had been given.  Host: Very cool. Give back and then also pursue that love of --  Raja Chari: Right.  Host: -- flying and engineering. So, tell me about your time in the, in the Air Force Academy.  Raja Chari: So I'd say the Air Force Academy was four-year sleep deprivation exercise, basically. The first year, as I think most people expect is a pretty intense experience, but I think what I took out of the Air Force Academy was the idea that I could pretty much do anything or survive just about anything if I just persevere and, and I, you know, I think I learned the idea of resilience is where I first got, you know, that sort of drilled into me. And looking at things as half-full. And so, yeah, it was, it was a wonderful time to look back on; while I was there it was not as pleasant. I think if you'd ask me, you know, then I would have given you a different answer and a list of a litany of complaints. But looking back on it, it sort of one of those things you realize how formative of a time that was. And glad, glad I had that experience. It's definitely colored most of my life after that.  Host: It geared you up for being a test pilot. So what was, what was that like? What do you do as a test pilot?  Raja Chari: So, as a test pilot, I think the easiest analogy I, I use the translator. And the translator is between the person doing the thing and the person who built the thing. And so, in test pilot world it's the people who built the plane and the people who are flying the plane. And so, just like if someone was going to test drive a car, they could, to test drive the car and come back and tell the dealer, like, I don't, I don't like it. Well, that's, that's not very actionable. You know, they can’t change the car based on “I don't like it.” And so, for us as test pilots we're, we're to take it to the next level, like, OK, I don't like this because when, you know, because the human factors interface is bad. And here's how you can fix it. So that's sort of our, our job is to live in both those worlds.  Host: You were not only that, you were not only a test pilot, but you were a leader as well. You were a flight test squadron commander, you a, you were a colonel. So, so what was it like, you know, taking on that role, taking on that responsibility and, and what you had to do to -- master that?  Raja Chari: I'm glad you asked. Because we talked about why did I go to the Air Force Academy, was to fly; I think why I stayed in the Air Force actually became less and less about flying and more and more about people. And so I, you know, people talk about when you're in the military, like, to strive, like you’re, you're, you're end goal should be to become a commander. And you kind of just saying that because everyone says you should do that. But I don't think I really realized until I was in it why, and it was amazing. It was exhausting physically, mentally. But it was, I mean, I think my wife would say the same thing. She was just completely exhausted by the end of that tour. Because, you know, I had the squadron and the test force to take care of; she had the spouses, the families. You know, it is a 24/7 job. And it's not just commanding, you know, the, the actual unit’s actions, but you're taking care of the people, it is a huge family. And that's why it's so rewarding, and, you know, whether it's because you're mentoring young airmen, you know, and helping them, whether it's, you know, coming up with a financial plan or, you know, dealing with sickness or injuries or their job performance, you know, it’s, it is all these things across a huge spectrum. And it's so rewarding to do but so, so exhausting. So, in the military we generally only have people be commanders for two years. And I realized about 18 months into it, like, there's a reason because you could only handle this for about two years, and then you need to just decompress for a little bit.  Host: Yeah.  Raja Chari: But it, yeah, it was a, I loved it. I would, I would do it again in heartbeat.  Host: So then what made you start considering being an astronaut?  Raja Chari: So, I think I'd always had in the back of mind being an astronaut would be a great thing to do; I don't think I thought it was really realistic until I was a test pilot and then and saw that other test pilots had gone on to become astronauts. And that's at the point I think I started really pursuing it. And then the ah-ha moment for me was when I went to do interviews in 2013 at NASA, I was blown away by the people at Johnson Space Center and just the interactions, like, the other people interviewing but also the people, we went to some of the training facilities and every place I went, I, you know, I could see myself, like, this is a place I would like to come to work, this is a, you know, a great culture, a great workforce. And then I started thinking about my time in the Air Force and, also very high-performing organization. And, but it dawned on me that the reason I liked the Air Force wasn't, I liked flying, don't get me wrong, but it was really about the people.  Host: Yeah.  Raja Chari: And that's what made me realize, oh, man I could, there's a chance to do this job. Because in the Air Force at some point I have to stop flying. You know, at some point I'm going to get too old. But you're never too old to hang out with really amazing people. And so, that really appealed to me to come to NASA, and the mission is, you know, clearly, the reason I get in the morning is to help with human exploration, solve humanity problems. It's a pretty good reason to get up and come to work.  Host: And I feel like you got, I mean, just from talking to some of your crewmates, it seems like you guys as a crew really get along together. So, in terms of that people aspect, it seems like you guys are really a good unit.  Raja Chari: Yeah, absolutely. I would, I mean obviously, I would not say don't send us to space. But would, I would also be just the fact that I get to train with these other three people and --  Host: Yeah.  Raja Chari: -- and go on, you know, go on these trips to Russia, to Hawthorne, to SpaceX, and have these experiences, that in itself is great. I mean, I would, again, I'm not saying don't launch us -- please launch us -- but if we weren't to launch in October or November, I would actually still be pretty happy about, about the year.  Host: What are you looking forward to most? When you're up in space, what's really some of things that you're really, really looking forward to?  Raja Chari: I think the things I'm most excited about are, you know, learning, basically, talking with the scientists as we're doing the research for them. And so, trying to actually understand what, you know, what is this helping with? Or what are you, you know, so, our days are packed with, essentially setting up experiments, you know, getting the results, you know, and then setting up the next one. And then we're tearing down something. And so, I think, you know, once we're actually on the loops with them, so in training we don't do a whole lot with the actual scientists because they never know exactly which ones we're going to be doing, and so that's one thing I'm looking forward to is once I'm actually on the loops -- the radio  -- when you're on the headset talking to them like, here's what I'm doing, and then have chance to talk with the them after: like, what, what is that, you know, what is that going to teach you? Or what, what's, what are the implications? And sometimes they don't even know. Like, sometimes it's you know, we don't know. We're trying this new protein and who knows what, you know, vaccine, or you know, treatment it could be used in.  Host: But that's the idea is, it's a, it's a platform to explore…  Raja Chari: Right.  Host: …all the possibilities, is microgravity the only place you could take that out of the equation, let's see what can happen.  Raja Chari: Exactly.  Host: Yeah. Very cool. You got a lot to do, Raja, so what's some of the, you said, you said got some trips coming up until actual launch, and then you've got launch day itself…  Raja Chari: Yep.  Host: …so, so what's coming up?  Raja Chari: So what we got coming up, we have two more trips to SpaceX out in Hawthorne. And out there we'll focus on crew responses to off-nominal situations. And so, out in Hawthorne they have a whole capsule simulator, so that's one of the few places we can do the physical tasks that are associated with those things, like getting the suit on in the capsule and reconfiguring it and stowing things that might be out and pressurizing the suit. All the things that might happen in the event of an emergency. We'll spend a week at the Cape doing water survival. And so that's all having to do with if the capsule came down and we had to get out early, or we came down in a place where we're not expecting to come down, how do you get out of the water, or out of the capsule into the water, set up a life raft, all that, all that kind of stuff. Also while we're down at the Cape we'll also deal with emergency egress from the pad, the launch pad, and the rocket, so if there's anything on launch day that, you know, they want us to get out of the rocket ourselves -- normally they would come unstrap us and do all that for a launch scrub, but if there's anything that it's more time critical, we have to be able to do that ourselves. So basically, dress rehearsals of all those things. And very similar to the, the military in flight test world, we don't think any of those things will happen, we hope they don't happen, but all of our training is focused on what if it does happen? Like, let's make sure we've, we've trained and prepared for all that.  Host: You got to be prepared for it. that's right. Lots to do. And I'll let you get to it. Raja Chari, thanks so much for coming out.  Raja Chari: Thanks very much. Thanks for having me on.  Host: Next is NASA astronaut Tom Marshburn, pilot of the Crew Dragon spacecraft and second in command for the mission. He's responsible for spacecraft systems and performance. On board station he'll serve as an Expedition 66 flight engineer until he takes over as command[er] of the International Space Station. Marshburn is a Statesville, North Carolina native who became an astronaut in 2004. Prior to serving in the astronaut corps, the medical doctor served as flight surgeon at NASA's Johnson Space Center in Houston, and later became medical operations lead for the International Space Station. The Crew-3 mission will be his third visit to the space station, and his second-long duration mission, and the Crew Dragon will be the third spacecraft for Marshburn to fly in after the space shuttle and the Russian Soyuz. He previously served as a crew member of STS-127 in 2009, and Expeditions 34 and 35, which concluded in 2013. A great guy to talk to. So, here's Tom Marshburn.   Host: Tom Marshburn, thanks so much for coming on Houston We Have a Podcast.  Tom Marshburn: Thanks for having me.  Host: Hey, launch is right around the corner. How are you feeling?  Tom Marshburn: Oh, feeling ready to go. I think we all feel ready to launch tomorrow, but we know there's some buffing around the edges we still need to do. And so, we're, we're excited to finish up the next couple months. It feels like it's we're going to launch tomorrow. And this times going to go by fast.  Host: What do you have left to do in this next couple of months to gear up for launch?  Tom Marshburn: We have a few more training sessions. You know, the training ramps up to where we're finally at the stage where we as a crew train together, and not just myself and the commander. And so, we are learning our choreography, our communication skills amongst the whole crew, but also wrapping in mission control both at SpaceX and at Houston for the launch and landing portions of the flight.  Host: OK.  Tom Marshburn: So we're, that's still to come. We'll, we'll have a couple of NBL runs, or Neutral Buoyancy Lab spacewalk training runs. And then a whole slew of things, last minute touches on certain things that are require up to date motor skills, up to date knowledge.  Host: Try to squeeze in as much as possible…  Tom Marshburn: Right.  Host: …before that flight.  Tom Marshburn: Everybody wants to get a piece of the crew before, for good reasons say, don't forget X, practice this one more time.  Host: That's right. That's right. I want to get to know a little bit more about you with this, with this time that we have. So I want to start with some of your, some of your early life. We got, we just got off the camera talking about some of the same stuff, but growing up in, it was North Carolina, right?  Tom Marshburn: Right.  Host: And being an outdoorsy kind of person and…  Tom Marshburn: Right.  Host: …your inspiration for, for space?  Tom Marshburn: So, small town North Carolina. Significantly, the last of seven kids; had a lot of people to look up to. A lot of things that, examples that I wanted to follow or not follow. And, you know, everybody growing up as teenagers and such.  Host: Yeah.  Tom Marshburn: But, had a farm in north Georgia that we're, we had a chance to really explore and go off into the woods, and live outdoors for a while. And that really translated into a love of, of the outside. I became a backpacker and a climber, and, which was just a, just a first step in the whole idea of putting a human being out into a, an austere and maybe dangerous place. So space and learning about space became the most exciting aspect of that that I could imagine.  Host: And so, the way that you decided to pursue that love of space was through physics. Why physics?  Tom Marshburn: Physics, for me, was the most basic science. It was the science that explained it all. Everything else seemed to build up from physics. So, I loved asking those deep, sometimes philosophical questions, and that was why I fell in love with it.  Host: But then, so you started pursuing that in college; your, your bachelor's, I believe, and your master's were in physics. And then at some point you make the switch to medicine.  Tom Marshburn: Yeah, I switched to medicine when I found out that, after spending enough time in the laboratories and engineering, engineering work, that I was missing more contact with people.  Host: Hmm.  Tom Marshburn: I really enjoyed talking to people, getting to know them better. I had friends that were medical students; of course, my family was familiar with medicine, so it was not as such a strange idea to go off into medicine. But I figured that maybe was where my best skills were, what I could be best at. And so, I applied to medical school, got in, and made the transition from this purely analytical world to understanding the human being. And that was a fascinating switch.  Host: But that love of space never went away. And at some point, you were able to merge the two worlds: you got into, into medicine, and then next thing you know, you're working at NASA.  Tom Marshburn: Yeah. The space interest went dormant for a while.  Host: Hmm.  Tom Marshburn: Medicine is so intense that you really have to put all your brain and all of your time and your body into it. But after I'd finished my training, I was in practice in Seattle, I got a letter from a former colleague who said, hey, I just heard NASA has this new training program for turning outside doctors into flight surgeons, to take care of astronauts and pilots. And I thought well, you know, I used to be interested in space; I keep thinking about how I can get into it…this seems like a perfect open door. So, I had to apply, but I got into the first class of the Space Medicine Fellowship at NASA.  Host: Very cool. So, from there, you worked at NASA, you got to learn from a lot of cool people, travel to a lot of cool places as a flight surgeon. At some point you were thinking, hey I could actually be an astronaut. When did that come up?  Tom Marshburn: My desire to become an astronaut kind of grew during that time. The opportunity arose as soon as I got here. And people said hey, you're a doc, why don't you apply? So I applied and I did not get in. And so, over the years, there was three more applications, but my fascination with space, my desire to work with these people that at that moment were my colleagues and patients, but to work with them in space, grew quite a bit. And so, after my fourth application I got in.  Host: Finally. Yes.  Tom Marshburn: Yes.  Host: And then you got to, you know, through a lot of training, you got to experience a flight from the shuttle, STS-127. So, tell me about that.  Tom Marshburn: Right. So, five years after we were selected, I finally got a chance to fly. The mission was very, very intense: 16 days, 11 days docked to the, docked to the space station, most of that time doing robotic operations; five EVAs (extravehicular activity). I mean, something was going on all the time. It was just a sprint. We were busy all the time. Even if you had time to sleep it was hard to sleep because your mind was buzzing with what you had to do and the work that had been done. And of course, it was my first spacewalk, and then I had two more after that, which certainly, kind of wraps up your whole brain. It's hard to think about anything right before or right after a spacewalk other than getting that done.  Host: Especially with a, with a flight that's just so jammed packed with activities. You have to do the spacewalk and then you got to go onto the next thing, right?  Tom Marshburn: Right. As a matter of fact, it all stacked on top of each other also. If we hit a stopping place and we couldn't continue on, we only had a few days to solve it because the other spacewalks had to happen in order to get the work done before we came home. So, it was very intense. The ground team was working like crazy; if we ran into a problem, some bolt was stuck or some…  Host: Hmm.  Tom Marshburn: …object we had in our hands we couldn't fit in the right place, we had to come up with an answer right away.  Host: Now that was different from your long-duration mission. A lot of people compare it instead of the sprint they call it a marathon. Now what was, what was that? This is Expedition 34/35.  Tom Marshburn: Right. Right. Went up there; space station has been growing in its capability to do science, and it was in this, this really exciting phase of some experiments with fluids and material science. And I was a guinea pig as well to where we were, we were, had a fairly punishing schedule. By the end of the work week we were tired. And occasionally working on the weekends. And the station has continued to grow since then. Didn't have a spacewalk planned but at the very end we had an emergency spacewalk that we had to perform, it was only three days before I was supposed to come home. So that was a great surprise that, that had happened, and surprised that they were going to allow us, right before we came home, to get that job done and do that spacewalk.  Host: And so, you're going to be returning for another long-duration mission.  Tom Marshburn: Right.  Host: Now that one was, was the Soyuz. This time you're going on the SpaceX Dragon. So how have you been gearing up for this mission?  Tom Marshburn: Just like for the other missions, getting ready for spaceflight, I think humans kind of know how to get somebody ready. You do some academics, you get in the simulator early, you start working with your immediate crew, and then you build the team as you get closer to launch. There are certain motor skills you got to know like in spacewalking, keep that up, there's some science experiments that require motor skills that we have maintain; robotics operations, how to fly that Canadarm so that you can grab satellites that, your cargo satellites out of, out of space and dock them to the station. So you're keeping all those skills going while you're also learning what science is going to be there so you can operate on a day-to-day basis effectively.  Host: Now you have three rookie crew members that are flying with you. And I say rookie, but just talking to you recently, they're all just super-sharp people and they're all very skilled but you're the only person that has that experience that can share that knowledge of what it's like to fly in space. So, how have you been doing that with your crewmates?  Tom Marshburn: So, making sure they understand at each stage of flight what our, our limitations might be.  Host: Hmm.  Tom Marshburn: What challenges that we might have from a physiologic standpoint, what it's going to feel like? What it's going to feel like to live there? What are their expectations for what they think they're going to get done? And I want to make sure they can get everything done that they want, but I'll be there to help, certainly; I know how I'm going to react, my body’s going to react, when I get to zero g. I know what my limitations are going to be. And so hopefully, I can help them if we have any gaps that need to be filled once we get up there. But also, helping the crew, I, we're all very good at this anyway, but helping them make sure the crew has, that we have a good culture.  Host: Hmm.  Tom Marshburn: That we are, number one, that we're safe. No question everybody's going to want to get the job done. But I want to make sure everybody has a good time too.  Host: Absolutely. And it sounds like you're going to. You have a pretty, pretty good crew with you. And it sounds like you guys get along.  Tom Marshburn: Yeah, we do. And that's one of the values of training together. Not just in the simulator, not just during the workday, but getting out together, having dinner together…  Host: Yeah.  Tom Marshburn: …that's absolutely essential to get to know each other.  Host: Very cool. Well, Tom, I wish you the best on your upcoming mission. Godspeed. Thanks for coming on.  Tom Marshburn: Hey, thanks very much. I appreciate it.  Host: Next, we have NASA astronaut Kayla Barron, a mission specialist for Crew-3. As a mission specialist she will work closely with the commander and the pilot to monitor the spacecraft during the dynamic launch and re-entry phases of flight. Once aboard the station she'll become a flight engineer for Expedition 66 for her first trip to space. Barron was born in Pocatello, Idaho, but considers Richland, Washington her hometown. She earned a bachelor's degree in systems engineering from the U.S. Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland in 2010, and a master's degree in nuclear engineering from the University of Cambridge in England in 2011 as Gates Cambridge Scholar. Lieutenant Commander Barron earned her submarine warfare officer qualification and deployed three times while serving aboard the USS Maine. At the time of her selection as an astronaut candidate in 2017, she was serving as the flag aide to the superintendent of the U.S. Naval Academy. What an incredible person to talk to, and seemingly always full of energy. Here's Kayla Barron.  Host: Kayla Barron, thanks so much for coming on Houston We Have a Podcast.  Kayla Barron: Thanks for having me.  Host: Hey, launch is right around the corner. How are you feeling?  Kayla Barron: Good. I mean it is coming up really quick. I think for me as a --  Host: Yeah.  Kayla Barron: -- rookie it doesn't always feel totally real. You know, we've been in training since I got selected in 2017, and we do a lot of awesome simulated training. And it's easy to forget sometimes that like, I'm going to be on the top of a rocket in a couple months going to space. So I think it kind of hits me in waves where I'll have this moment, you know, like the first time I touched our capsule at SpaceX. Or certain moments in training where it just hits me in this really emotional moment, like, oh I'm going, it's real, I'm doing this thing.  Host: I am going. Yeah.  Kayla Barron: And then it kind of fades back into this, like, I don't know is this real life? Sort of, pinch me attitude.  Host: [Laughter] Well I want to, I want to understand how you got to this moment. How you became an astronaut to, to go on this mission, on the SpaceX Dragon to go to the International Space Station, conduct all kinds of great science. We're going back to your childhood, and your early interest. I want to start with your interest in going into the military. I think it's an awesome story of how, you know, you could have pursued a lot of different things, but there was that moment that inspired you that says a military career is something that I want to do.  Kayla Barron: Yeah, I mean it was something I started thinking about from a pretty young age. I think about twelve or thirteen I first started, you know, having an awareness of what it meant to serve in the military. I have some extended family in the military. I lived near the Air Force Academy during the part of my childhood when I lived in Colorado. And that was kind of something in the back of my mind that I was thinking about maybe going forward. And then at the beginning of my eighth-grade year, I was 14 years old, 9/11 happened. And that was just like this hugely eye-opening moment for me at a super-developmental time in my life. You know, just starting to understand how the world works, how complicated, how scary it can be. And that really traumatic moment got my attention. But then as I watched our country come together to respond to that super-tragic event, and really unite behind what it means to be an American, for me cemented my desire to want to serve. You know, I wanted to continue my education. I was interested in engineering. But I also was interested in how to challenge myself to develop as a leader, how to be a good person, how to support the people around me. And I was thinking about, you know, what can I do with my life that will have the biggest impact? How can I make the world a better place? And for me it felt like the military was the right place to start that journey. And that's how I ended up at the Naval Academy.  Host: So, what were the things you were doing at the Naval Academy, first couple, you know, years? What were you doing?  Kayla Barron: Yeah, you know, at the Naval Academy we kind of have this three-part mission. The moral, mental and physical. So, the moral mission, it's all about developing yourself as a person, a leader, a teammate. You know, being person of integrity, making the right decision even when nobody's watching. Working as a team. Developing your leadership skills. The mental part for me, I decided to study engineering. So I studied systems engineering, which at the Naval Academy is control systems and robotics, a really integrated view of engineering, and got a lot of awesome experience in the classroom and in the laboratories there. And then the physical mission. I got to run cross country and track at the Naval Academy, and my teammates were really the core of my social group. And I got to learn how to push myself beyond my limits; you know, the, you think you're capable of running a certain time in a certain race, and then you find out like how to push those challenging moments and beyond into new capabilities. And so, those sort of major things combined helped me prepare myself to serve in the military after graduation.  Host: That was, that's perfect. Because then you, you had all these skills. I wonder at what point though you started thinking, you know, I'd like to, I'd like to pursue going into a submarine. When, when did that start coming up?  Kayla Barron: Pretty quickly after I got there. When I first showed up I, I knew for sure I wanted to be a naval aviator. I wanted to be a fighter pilot.  Host: Yeah.  Kayla Barron: And the cool thing about the Naval Academy is officers from every single part of the Navy serve there, and we also get a chance to experience those communities during our summer training. And so pretty quickly I found myself drawn to submarine warfare officers as mentors. I just really connected with the way they saw the world. They’re are nerds, funny, you know, kind of sarcastic. And it just seemed like a good fit from that standpoint. But what really cemented it was my chance to go underway on a submarine during summer training. We actually got to go, go out, submerge, kind of do a day’s worth of operations, and I was so impressed by the sailors in the submarine force. You know, the Naval Academy, you're going to be commissioned as a junior officer, a junior leader in the military. And the people you're leading are the enlisted sailors or Marines in the Navy. And these sailors were so smart, so intrinsically motivated, they really cared about what they were doing. And I could tell that they held the junior officers to a really high standard, but also, on the other hand, were willing to invest in shaping those junior officers into the kinds of leaders they'd be willing to follow. And so it just seemed like a super-challenging operational environment to operate a reactor or drive a submarine, with this really complicated equipment, really complicated team, but also, a really supportive team to help me develop along the way.  Host: It seems like that people aspect is something that's super-important to you. And like it, it seems like you, you have a lot of passion for you know, the, the Naval Academy taught you a lot of good skills about systems engineering, you pursued nuclear engineering, you learned a lot. But it seems like that people aspect, just being with the right people surrounded by smart, driven people is something that's pretty important to you.  Kayla Barron: Yeah. I mean I think that's always been the core of where of where I found myself. Whether that was in athletics growing up, in my studies…  Host: Uh-huh.  Kayla Barron: …my family, the people I surrounded myself with. I -- I'm always looking for ways to improve and become a better version of myself, because I want to figure out how to make my career, my life, my relationships count. I want to leave the world better than I found I found it. I want to serve. And so, to figure out how to do that I think you need to be around a supportive team who's going to push you, challenge you, call you out when you make mistakes or have done something wrong, and also help you learn how to be better. And so, for me, I get the most energy from being on an awesome team. And I love working in a nerdy engineering operational environments, if I can with those teams. But for me, the people come first.  Host: I loved your story. We were talking a little bit earlier about, you know, when you went, when you started thinking about becoming a NASA astronaut and you're surrounded, you know, in the interview process, you're surrounded by all --  Kayla Barron: Uh-huh.  Host: -- these super smart people, right? This --  Kayla Barron: Yeah.  Host: -- and you said you had this, this feeling of imposter syndrome. Like --  Kayla Barron: Uh-huh.  Host: -- what am I doing here? But I wonder, you know, if you can a little, share that experience one, but then also if you got that same sense that you're talking about of being in this nerdy, you know, environment…  Kayla Barron: Uh-huh.  Host: …and, and, and you can, you know, call this place home.  Kayla Barron: Yeah. You know, I think when I first showed up for interviews, I really felt that imposter syndrome, like, like you mentioned. You just meet the other candidates.  Host: Yeah.  Kayla Barron: And they're so smart, so accomplished. They've done all these amazing things. Been on all these crazy adventures. And I was just like, I don't, what am I doing here, you know? The, even the idea of applying to be astronaut was pretty new idea to me, so I hadn't had a lot of time to internalize all of the details of what it took to be astronaut, what it took to get selected. And so, I was kind of just like jumping in straight into the deep end. And for me the, meeting those other candidates, I was like, wow, I don't know, they might have called me by mistake; I don't know if I'm supposed to be here right now. But it also instilled sort like a healthy fatalism sort of. Like --  Host: Hmm.  Kayla Barron: -- you know, I'm just going to be myself. I don't know exactly what they saw on my application, why they were interested in meeting me. But if I try to be authentic, genuine, share who I am, good and bad. You know, if the committee of all of these fantastic accomplished people around NASA, in astronaut and outside the astronaut office, think I'll be a good fit, they're probably right; and if they think I'm a bad fit or I'm not ready yet, they're probably right about that, too. So, I kind of took a deep breath and just decided to be myself. But now that I'm here, to your point, it's just a group of super like-minded people.  Host: Hmm.  Kayla Barron: Everyone at NASA, it's just such an inspiring place to work. Everyone cares about the mission. Everyone cares about each other. And everyone cares up -- cares about showing up to be the best version of themselves, to put themselves behind that mission, to improve every single day. And so it's impossible to come here and not be inspired by the people around you. Like even if you're having a sort of a bad day driving into work, maybe you missed your coffee or whatever, you show up and the energy is palpable. Like you feel it and you want to show up for your team. So, it's a great group of people to work with.  Host: And you, you got the astronaut job, you went through the training, and now you get a new set of great people. And that is your, your crew. What are looking forward to doing with your, with this crew, Crew-3, on the space station? Tell me a little bit about them.  Kayla Barron: I'm really excited to work with the other people on Crew-3. Like, I was so pumped when I found out I was going to be a part of that team because it's just an incredible group of people with very different experiences and perspectives that I think are really complimentary. You know, Raja [Chari], he's an Air Force test pilot. He has a ton of leadership experience in the Air Force, and really brings an awesome operational perspective but a really amazing disposition as a person, a teammate and a leader as well. He's great at giving and taking feedback, he brings out the best in everyone around him and incorporates everybody, really utilizes the skills and perspectives of everyone on our team. Tom [Marshburn], he is one of the most experienced astronauts we have at NASA. He's flown to space on the space shuttle, on the Soyuz to the space station, and now he's flying on Dragon. So, he has years and years of experience and he's worked with a ton of people across NASA and across our office, has a lot of unique perspectives. And he also just is an incredible mentor. He's really invested in sharing that experience with us. But he doesn't try to say like, oh, you have to do it this way because that's way I do it; like, he really has gotten to know us. He's a great listener, and he has a way of applying his experience in a way that will work for you. And then of course, Matthias [Maurer], our partnership with the European Space Agency: he's from Germany, he's part of our crew. And getting to know him throughout training, I really, really love working with him because he thinks differently than anyone else I've worked with at NASA. He really has a way of breaking things down to their fundamental elements: understanding, one, how things work, and two, exactly what is try, what we're trying to accomplish.  Host: Uh-huh.  Kayla Barron: And he has a way of figuring out new tools, techniques, ways of thinking about things. And so, I feel like he's really expanded my skill set as an astronaut because I've incorporated a lot of his techniques and ways of thinking into how I do things.  Host: So, what do you have left on the agenda to do with this crew to get ready for launch day?  Kayla Barron: You know, launch day is coming up pretty quick.  Host: Yeah.  Kayla Barron: But we still have some pretty important training. We're going to head to Florida, to Kennedy Space Center, to really see what the launch pad configuration’s going to be like; how we're going to get into the vehicle, we're going to practice getting out of the capsule in the water in case we had to do that in an unsupported landing site. We have more emergency training in the Dragon and here, and for the space station in our mockups here. And then we all have a little bit of spacewalk training left, some robotics training left, and also, just getting our lives together so we can leave the planet for six months.  Host: True. A lot to do, Kayla. And I will let you get to it. Thank so much for coming on Houston We Have a Podcast.  Kayla Barron: Thanks for having me.  Host: Last but not least, we have ESA astronaut Matthias Maurer, who is also a mission specialist for Crew-3 working with the commander and pilot to monitor the spacecraft during the dynamic launch and re-entry phases of flight. He will also become a long-duration crew member aboard the International Space Station. Maurer comes from Sankt Wendel in the German state of Saarland. Before becoming an astronaut, Maurer held a number of engineering and research roles, both in a university setting and at ESA. In 2016 Maurer spent sixteen days on an undersea mission as a part of NASA's Extreme Environment Mission Operations, or NEEMO, space analog. Like Chari and Barron, Maurer will be making his first trip to space with the Crew-3 mission. Overall a wonderful person with a fascinatingly unique perspective. Here's Matthias Maurer.  Host: Matthias Maurer, thanks so much for coming on Houston We Have a Podcast.  Matthias Maurer: Well, thank you for having me.  Host: Your launch is right around the corner, Matthias. How are you feeling? You excited?  Matthias Maurer: Yeah. Yeah. Kind of, but I think the excitement will come on launch day.  Host: That's right. We are recording this pretty, pretty early. So, there's, there's still a lot of work for you to do, a lot more training that you have to accomplish. I want to get to that Matthias. Before I do, I'm going to take a step from the very beginning. I want to learn more about you. Tell me about where you were born, what you studied, some of your early life.  Matthias Maurer: Yeah. So, I born in Germany and I grew up in Germany. Did the civil service as a paramedic. And then I studied in different countries. So, France, in the U.K., in Spain. So, it was all part of an integrated European study program in material science. And that's how I discovered that traveling and learning languages and learning about different cultures, it's a real enrichment.  Host: So you a, you would describe yourself as a people person then?  Matthias Maurer: Definitely.  Host: OK. Very cool. And what's been your experiences traveling around and learning those new languages; what has it taught you that you've implemented in your life?  Matthias Maurer: Well, it's like, the main lesson learned is like they're a lot of different solutions to the same problem.  Host: Huh.  Matthias Maurer: And when you grow up in Germany, it's like, you’re kind of, it has to be done this way. And but looking back from the outside and traveling to countries like India, for example…  Host: Hmm.  Matthias Maurer: …you find that there are very unique solutions, very creative solutions to the same types of problems. So it's, it broadens the horizons, and it also helps to see the world a little bit more globally.  Host: Very interesting. So, what's, what's interesting is you're describing yourself as a people person. I wonder how that folds into some of your studies, because you went for material science. So tell me about some of the things, what interested you in materials, and what are some of the cool people that you got to meet along the way?  Matthias Maurer: Well, actually my initial interest was aerospace engineering.  Host: Oh, interesting.  Matthias Maurer: But kind of like, it's a bit longer story, but when I started studying it was at the time when the Berlin Wall came down.  Host: Hmm.  Matthias Maurer: And so basically, I wanted to sign up in Berlin to study aeronautics. But these were the years when everything changed. And so, basically, I was kind of, I had to choose a different type of study at least for one year. So I started material science engineering. And the guys at the university who told me like, OK, next year you may then be able to switch to aerospace engineering in Berlin. They had told me like it's all the same for the first two, three years; it's basically engineering. And, but then I discovered material science is really interesting. I didn't know anything about it. And basically, the, the origin of innovation is 70% in the material that you choose. So, well, I started it and I got so fascinated that I decided, like, OK, that's exactly what I want to study. It's probably much, much better than aerospace engineering.  Host: [Laughter] Well, you studied it a lot, right? You got a --  Matthias Maurer: Yes.  Host: -- you got a Ph.D. in materials, right?  Matthias Maurer: Yes. I studied in several countries, and I got in total three engineering diplomas, in material science, material engineering, materials technology. And also a Ph.D.  Host: Very good. You threw in a little economics in there as well, right?  Matthias Maurer: That was an add on. Because --  Host: Oh, interesting.  Matthias Maurer: -- like I was dreaming about, like, one day I want to like start my own company --  Host: Hmm.  Matthias Maurer: -- and so, when I studied in France, for example, economics is part of the studies, and I liked this aspect because in Germany when you study an engineering title you, you never get into contact with economics. But I feel like when you want to start a company, you should also know about what's important to also sell your product. So I felt like that's helpful for, to become successful as an engineer. And so, I added all the economics, that was an add on.  Host: Very good. So, I wonder where astronaut comes in. Because it seems like you were thinking about a lot of different career paths sort of along your journey; it doesn't, it's not like, I mean, a lot of the stories I hear are, I always wanted to be an astronaut…that doesn't seem to be the case for you.  Matthias Maurer: Yeah. So as a kid, I grew up in an area where we had a lot of fighter planes --  Host: Hmm.  Matthias Maurer: -- flying across Germany. So, a lot of people know Ramstein, it's the biggest American air base outside of the U.S., and so, I grew up around 50, 60 kilometers from there.  Host: Oh.  Matthias Maurer: So I watched all these people flying up in the sky. And thought like, wow, that's good fun, I want to be become a pilot when I grow up. And later on, it's like I learned how to fly a glider plane. So being always fascinated by flying and exploring the third dimension of our planet. But I also was interested in the technology. So that was why I decided to become an engineer, and to do research. And later on, I also combined my material science background with the paramedic background that I had when I developed new materials for medical applications. So I developed blood filters before becoming an astronaut. So, yeah, I was, I was interested in a lot of stuff, and I wanted to dig into the details and to learn about what is behind.  Host: OK. Well, tell me about your selection when you started applying, and then your interesting path to actually come on to ESA as an astronaut.  Matthias Maurer: Yes. So the selection started in 2008, and I remember well, I came back from work like developing my blood filters, and switched on the TV in the evening, and learned on the news, like, ESA is looking for new astronauts.  Host: Hmm.  Matthias Maurer: And I thought like hang on. It's like I was, I wanted to study aerospace engineering before, and I'm fascinated by flying and technology; I'm an engineer, and I love science. So combining all these facts, I felt like an astronaut today does exactly that. He works, or he or she works, with a lot of, like, technology on the brink of what is possibly, what is possible, and we do a lot of experiments in space, we work in international teams -- I love working in international teams -- and with the excitement and the adventure that you have when flying to space. So this is a very unique package. And I thought like, wow, that's finally, probably, the combination of all my interests in one job.  Host: And so, you applied.  Matthias Maurer: And that's why, that's why I applied.  Host: Very good. And it took you a while to actually get on to, to ESA, right?  Matthias Maurer: Oh, yeah. The selection took one year.  Host: Uh-huh.  Matthias Maurer: And after one year, from the eight and a half thousand Europeans that applied…  Host: Wow.  Matthias Maurer: …only ten persons passed all exams, all tests, and were considered to be suitable as astronaut. But then the director general of ESA told us, guys I only have six tickets, and I need to choose four persons, four of you who will not become astronaut. And so, Matthias, you're unfortunately one of them.  Host: Ahh.  Matthias Maurer: But I want you to work for ESA because I think you guys are all very intelligent, very suitable persons and I want you to work for ESA. My three colleagues who were also not taken decided, no: either astronaut or nothing.  Host: Hmm.  Matthias Maurer: And so, they continued in their job. I was the only one who accepted his offer and started working at the European Astronaut Centre, in the beginning as crew support and Eurocom -- Eurocom is like the equivalent of a Capcom (capsule communicator).  Host: OK.  Matthias Maurer: And after two years, I changed into a more management role. I was responsible for the, the evolution of European Astronaut Centre. So that's when we started also talking to our colleagues in China, maybe to bring in China into the international community. But also developing EAC towards Moon exploration.  Host: Hmm.  Matthias Maurer: And so, yeah, that's a lot of cooperation with universities, with scientists, but also, people within ESA.  Host: Very cool.  Matthias Maurer: Very exciting job.  Host: Yeah. So Matthias how did you go from there to becoming an astronaut?  Matthias Maurer: Well in 2015, the International Space Station program was extended four more years. And so, the director general came back to us and said like, I got more tickets to space, and I actually could hire one more astronaut  -- are you still interested? What a question.  Host: Of course, you were. [Laughter] Now you're an explorer at heart. You got to do a lot of cool things. You're about to launch to space. So you can call yourself an astronaut. But you're also an aquanaut and a cavenaut. Can you tell me about those experiences?  Matthias Maurer: Yes. Part of the training that we are able to do is we go down into a cave, that's in ESA training; we live six days, six nights, in a cave system. We explore this cave system. It's between 10, 20 kilometers long. So much, much deeper and longer than we actually can explore in these six days. And it's a training that is aiming at exploration, but at the same time at, like, strengthening your interpersonal skills --  Host: Hmm.  Matthias Maurer: -- to discover how you are perceived by your teammates, your crewmates, as a member of the team. So you actually work your leadership skills, you work your fellowship skills, and you learn how to work with people in a challenging environment with people that speak different languages, people that have a different cultural background, and how to give feedback when things go wrong, and also, how to request help when you need help.  Host: Hmm.  Matthias Maurer: So it's a very interesting training. And it also allows us access to a very hidden place, a beautiful, like, a beautiful place. These cave systems are so beautiful that you sometimes think like, wow, a master artist created this, and it's all hidden underground, and not accessible to normal people.  Host: That's right.  Matthias Maurer: The same I discovered living in the station, like on the bottom of the sea as a part of the NEEMO training.  Host: Uh-huh.  Matthias Maurer: I was an aquanaut during 16 days. And we explored Mars, so that was the analog simulation that we ran. This station is 20 meters below the surface of the sea, and so, on the bottom of the sea we lived there, and we explore the surface, a new environment. And I remember the very first day it felt kind of awkward having my helmet on, a helmet that actually is, like, locked onto my, my head, so I cannot take it off. So, in the beginning you think like, oh, what will happen if I feel uncomfortable, if I get kind of feeling of panic. But obviously, it's a test, like if you panic in this situation, you're not suitable for space.  Host: Uh-huh.  Matthias Maurer: And then you walk out there, and you concentrate: OK, do I fully understand all the, the, the mechanisms, the technology, what happens if, how can I do, how can I rescue myself, how can I help my colleague if he or she has a problem? The second day I went out there and, walking on the surface of Mars on the bottom of the sea, in our case, I felt like, wow, this is a completely new environment. This is so beautiful. And, and I felt like this is my new environment. I, I belong here; I'm part of this ecosystem. And all the fish that fly by, or swim by, they observe me and, and I enjoyed the beauty of this. And it was kind of a bizarre sensation, like, between the first and the second day: on the first day I was fully concentrated on myself, on being safe; on the second day I accepted being there. And it was very interesting to see that the human brain is so flexible and so fast in, in adapting to a new environment.  Host: Very good. And all, now that all the training, you do those experiences, and all the training that you've been doing so far is going to help you prepare for this mission on the Crew Dragon, Crew-3, going to the International Space Station for a long time. So can you tell me about some of your objectives there -- what are you going to be doing when you're onboard?  Matthias Maurer: Well, the, the flight to the International Space Station, I hope that it will be very straightforward. The capsule is highly automated so there's very little for us to do, actually, in a nominal situation. We have to monitor with everything goes according to the plan.  Host: Uh-huh.  Matthias Maurer: After 24 hours we hopeful, hopefully dock to the International Space Station and start our roughly six months science program up there. I bring around 35 European experiments to the International Space Station. And counting also the American, the Canadian, the Japanese experiments, I hope to participate in roughly 100 to 150 different experiments. Some of them will be unique, only run once or twice. And some of them are continuation of what my colleagues have started several years ago. Because in life sciences you also need some statistics so we repeat like many times the same experiment. We hopefully have also the opportunity to see the station grow: we get new modules, the Russians want to bring two new modules, one of these modules carries the European robotic arm. And that's kind of, like, exciting hardware that we developed in Europe. It's similar to the Canadian robotic arm in kind of, like, performance, it’s a bit smaller, shorter. But, OK, it will not be able to, to catch capsules that are send up with resupplies. But OK, it's a European technology that we want to check out in space and see how it performs. Then we have several spacewalks that hopefully will be upcoming. And we will also see different capsules coming, we will see the Boeing capsule flying to the International Space Station, we'll see spaceflight participants coming with the Russian Soyuz capsule but also with the Dragon capsule. So lots of people, lots of experiments, and lots of excitement.  Host: And lots of excitement! Wow. There's a lot that's going to happen in your mission, that is for sure. And you get to do it with three NASA crewmates. Tell me about your, your crew. How, how are you guys all work together, and you're going to be able to do all of this together. So how do you describe yourself as a crew?  Matthias Maurer: I think we are an extremely homogenous crew.  Host: Cool.  Matthias Maurer: So we are three rookies, but “rookie” sounds like as we are beginners and actually looking at my colleagues Raja and Kayla, they are absolutely experienced operators in piloting very sophisticated planes and piloting or operating a nuclear submarine. So I, I would say anything but rookie to them. Probably I'm the only rookie. Tom Marshburn, he has been twice to space, before becoming an astronaut he worked already as a crew surgeon in the, in the spaceflight program. So he has seen a lot, a lot of different crews, astronauts, different problems. So he prepared us, he helped us to like grow together as a team.  Host: Uh-huh.  Matthias Maurer: To be prepared for certain situations that might come. And so, I think I'm extremely happy with my crew. They are an excellent bunch of people. I enjoy every day of working with them, training with them, and I think we will have a very good time in space.  Host: Well, you're a people person. You, you love exploring new cultures and that's what, that's what's great about the International Space Station. You described all the things the Russians are doing, you have a NASA crewmates, and you're going to see people from all over the world, really, with these, with these tourists and private astronauts. More NASA astronauts. It's, it's going to be an incredible time. All because of international collaboration. You being a part of this now, and this is part of your mission, how, how do you view that, the international, the commercial cooperation, this era that you're going to be a part of right now.  Matthias Maurer: Well I'm very happy to see that our cooperation is actually growing. So, from the space agencies that started the International Space Station program, now, also, like having more and more commercial partners in there, it shows to me that we are on the correct path, on the right path. It's a space program gets more and more robust the more actors we have, and the more clever people we have, the better our technology will become, and the more hardware we have and the more exciting new destinations we can fly to. So, I'm very excited to see also the flights to the Moon upcoming --  Host: Uh-huh.  Matthias Maurer: -- the deep space Gateway station, like, coming to fruition. And so, we'll have exciting, exciting times ahead.  Host: What a, what a cool time to be a part of. Matthias Maurer, thank you so much for coming on Houston We Have a Podcast.

                        "description": "Gary Jordan (Host): Houston, we have a podcast! Welcome to the official podcast of the NASA Johnson Space Center, Episode 220, \"High Flying.\" I'm Gary Jordan, and I'll be your host today. On this podcast, we bring in the experts, scientists, engineers, and astronauts, all to let you know what's going on in the world of human spaceflight. But, let's be honest, we cover a lot more than that. When humans return to Earth on American spacecraft, a high-altitude aircraft is deployed to capture imagery as it heads in, providing early data on the spacecraft's status that helps mission control and recovery operations. That aircraft is called a WB-57. We've talked about the aircraft briefly on this podcast before, but today, we're going to explore the aircraft, its operations, and some cool features in more depth. Joining us for this episode is Carey Scott, goes by CJ; he's the deputy principal investigator of SCIFLI, which is of course an acronym for Scientifically Calibrated In-Flight Imagery, based out of NASA's Langley Research Center in Virginia. We'll talk about the WB-57, its operations, what SCIFLI is all about, and some ongoing work to prepare for Artemis missions with Orion returning from the Moon. Exciting stuff, so let's get right into it. Enjoy.  [ Music]  Host: Hey, CJ, thanks for coming on Houston We Have a Podcast today.  CJ Scott: Hi, Gary. Yeah, happy to be here. Thanks for having me.  Host: So I'm excited to talk about the WB-57. I love this airplane. I got to see it at Johnson Space Center a couple times and see some of the operations. But what I didn't realize is just, you know, there's much more to this, and I never really dove too deep into what it does, and the science, and some of the great investigations on board. So before we go into that, CJ, I want to understand a little bit about you. We were talking with Tom [Horvath], and you can talk a little bit about Tom before, before we get into you, if you want, but he said, you are the person that's going to take over the reins for this SCIFLI thing, so big responsibility. Tell us about yourself, and your career path that got you to where you are today.  CJ Scott: Yeah. Well, I was born and raised in, in California, went to Chico State, graduated in 2010 with a bachelor's in physics. I was actually a high school and middle school science teacher, and then I worked as a curriculum developer while I was pursuing an aerospace graduate degree. During that time I spent a summer working at NASA Ames [Research Center] as an opto-mechanical engineering intern for the SOFIA project, which is really cool. That's the Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared Astronomy; it's, like, the world's largest airborne infrared observatory, and basically it's a 747 aircraft with a huge IR telescope that points out of the aft section.  Host: Oh, cool.  CJ Scott: Yeah, pretty neat stuff. In 2017, I took a little break from school, and got an internship working at NASA Langley [Research Center] in Virginia. And then I was hired as an aerothermodynamics researcher in 2019. That's where I met Tom Horvath and Rich Schwartz. They started the SCIFLI project. Back when it started, it was called HYTHIRM (Hypersonic Thermodynamic Infrared Measurements), and, you know, basically as an aerothermodynamicist I kind of focused on, well, I focused on systems that basically help spacecraft survive, you know, the heating environment during launch or re-entry, you know, to Earth, say, from space station, or from the Moon. And, you know, I've always had a passion for human space exploration, spacecraft design, cosmology, so I'm really grateful to have been given the opportunity to work with Tom, and Rich, and the rest of the SCIFLI team to support NASA's, NASA’s mission.  Host: Were you always into airplanes? Seems like all these opportunities you took, you know, Ames and Langley, you've been in the world of aerospace, right, especially with flight, and NASA's a little bit of everything but seems like your interest lies with, with planes.  CJ Scott: Yeah, I mean, that's funny. You know, as a kid I had a lot of LEGO sets, and didn't matter what was the picture on the box, it was going to be some type of flight vehicle [laughter], whether it was an aircraft or a spaceship, or something. It was always, turned into an airplane at the end.  Host: That's hilarious. Awesome. Well, now you get to do the adult version of that, so that's fantastic. WB-57, let's talk about this particular aircraft, because I think that's a big part of some of, you talk about SCIFLI, we can get into that, but let's first start with the aircraft. You talk about SOFIA. This one is a little different, high-altitude plane. CJ, what is the WB-57?  CJ Scott: Yeah, so, you know, actually JSC, Johnson Space Center, is the home of the WB-57 High Altitude Research Program, which owns the last three of these aircraft in the world. Originally, it was called the WB-57F, I think, by General Dynamics, and these three have been repurposed, and are now based at Ellington Field. Essentially, they are high-altitude research aircraft. They've been flying since the '70s, and, you know, today, they are still an asset to the scientific community in, you know, human spaceflight.  Host: That's right. Now, OK, if I was imagining, you know, being a pilot for this thing, and I was going to do a research investigation, you know, what would that, what would that look like? I'm assuming, you know, I can't just, you know, go in as, like, a passenger, right? I feel like I have to wear something fancy to fly this thing.  CJ Scott: Yeah, so, I mean, the aircraft is pretty unique, right? It's a mid-wing, kind of dual-engine, long-range aircraft. It can fly for really long periods of time, up to about 60,000 feet. It's got a really long wingspan, about 122-1/2 feet, and so it's almost, you know, its wingspan is almost double the length from nose to tail. So --  Host: Oh, wow.  CJ Scott: -- yeah, it really does take some special skill to, to fly these things. For imaging missions, though, the crew, you know, usually operates below 50,000 feet, so they don't have to wear that bulky kind of full-pressure suit. The full-pressure suit is pretty cool. I've seen a few of the crew wearing them, and, I mean, it's, you're pretty much, you're almost like an astronaut, right? It's a whole thing. You got a helmet, and the whole, you know, the whole getup. It's pretty fascinating. The cockpit's got, you know, two members, two flight crew. There's a pilot and a sensor equipment operator, SEO. The pilot, you know, sits in the front, has everything he needs to operate the aircraft, while the SEO, or the back-seater, kind of has all the navigational equipment, but also the controls for operating all the payloads that may be, you know, on the aircraft.  Host: So you got two people flying, and sometimes they get to wear those super-cool suits. Now, in terms of a mission itself, right, I'm guessing it's not just those two folks. They got some, a little bit of help on the ground.  CJ Scott: Yeah, there's a whole host of personnel that really make operating the WB-57 possible. You know, the, the maintenance personnel do excellent work, you know, literally getting this aircraft off the ground, maintaining the vehicle. As far as mission planning goes, you know, we always begin with imaging objectives, and, you know, kind of go from there to develop, develop the mission more fully. But, yeah, there are a lot of people involved at various levels that make this type of work possible.  Host: Yeah, yeah. Let's explore mission planning a little bit more. So say, you know, it sounds like you have a good support network on the ground. You got the pilots ready to go. It's a very large aircraft. When you're getting ready to perform a mission, what goes into that? What do you have to do ahead of time to make sure you're ready to support whatever mission it is?  CJ Scott: Yeah, so, you know, as I mentioned earlier, the mission planning always begins with imaging objectives. So, you know, what part of the flight are we looking at? What locations on the vehicle do, does the customer want to see? Are there any dynamic events, or particular, you know, phenomena that need to be imaged? So the SCIFLI team will typically, you know, collect information. We call that, like, conops, or a concept of operations, from the customer, and then our team will kind of use that data to develop a preliminary kind of mission geometry to meet the derived requirements, or, you know, the scientific objectives. We will use, you know, high-fidelity modeling tools to kind of compile and simulate the geometries of the vehicle, and, you know, the theater of operations, the flight paths of, you know, the target, the imaging aircraft. We can input, you know, the timing of key events. We, you know, put in the payload spec[ification]s, and basically, you know, we put the entire mission into a 3D virtual environment. And that allows us to really communicate well, you know, back and forth with the customer, to make sure that everyone's on the same page for, you know, the imaging mission.  Host: Let's give a couple of examples of missions that at least I'm aware of; maybe you know of a couple of other ones. When it comes to supporting, you know, for the WB-57, supporting various missions: the ones, I mean, we're talking the human spaceflight down here at Johnson, so the ones I'm aware of are particularly for landings of human spaceflight vehicles. So the ones I know of are, you know, SpaceX Dragon, when that lands in the Atlantic Ocean, WB-57 is deployed, and provides some imagery, and the Orion, and that was true for EFT-1, Exploration Flight Test-1, and I know part of the discussion today is really gearing up for Artemis and supporting that in the future. So how do those work? Give us an example of what the team is doing to prepare for SpaceX return or for an Orion return.  CJ Scott: Yeah, definitely. So, you know, each mission really is unique, and depending on the target and the customer, we, you know, we optimize the flight to focus on, you know, the critical events. So sometimes, we're imaging rocket launches, so we want to maybe focus on booster performance. Sometimes we need to collect data to help assess, you know, material performance, so, you know, we may be imaging, like, the thermal protection system of a re-entry vehicle. And sometimes, you know, we focus on late-stage vehicle recovery events, like parachute deployment. Generally, we will kind of develop a flight profile with the WB-57 crew, you know, keeping in mind flight safety is always the primary objective, right, everyone's safety first. So the pilots always provide critical feedback on, you know, performance limitations, hazards, boundaries, and other things like that. The back-seaters will provide inputs to help us optimize the imaging system settings, and, like, the gimbal performance during the mission. Generally, the SEOs will configure the communication system, so it's important to be able to communicate both to and from the aircraft to the imaging support team, you know, that's located in mission control. Sometimes we broadcast images in real time, and sometimes we really need to communicate a message up to the, the cockpit to, you know, modify the flight. We get great support from the Spaceflight Meteorology Group at JSC. They kind of help us navigate through different weather systems, and of course, you know, SCIFLI helps to provide calibration of any of the sensors, we do material analysis. You know, it's really important to make sure sensors are properly configured, so they receive the right amount of light to avoid any kind of overexposure, which would make, you know, the image too bright, or underexposure, which could make the image too dim. You know, overexposure, or sometimes we call it saturation, it reduces the scientific value of the data, and underexposure actually reduces the signal-to-noise ratio, so it makes it a lot harder to pinpoint, you know, what signal you're getting. Ultimately, you know, we can convert thermal signatures into temperature. You know, that helps the researchers kind of verify their systems are performing as expected, or modify their design tools. As far as, like, a Dragon landing, you know, generally, once we've developed all of this kind of pre-mission work, we compile that into a, what's called a mission execution plan, or an MEP. And we, you know, share that with the customer, make sure everyone's on the same page. Then we will receive, like, a family of possible trajectories and splashdown points from SpaceX. The mission execution team will basically get those family of trajectories, process them using the simulation tools that I kind of mentioned earlier, and then provide the information to the WB-57 flight crew, you know, prior to takeoff. Then, you know, the operations team will maintain contact with, you know, lots of different people within NASA, at mission control, or, you know, from SpaceX to kind of receive updated mission information as the, you know, mission elapses. And generally, you know, we get a lot of this information prior to the Dragon undocking from ISS. Any mission updates that we get, including, you know, capsule status, or undock timing, splashdown location, that gets shared to the WB-57 crew, and then they can kind of adjust their flight accordingly.  Host: Would they deploy from, like, Texas? Is that part of the reason that you need it so early, is just because, OK, we need a plan, we need to make sure we're at the right place, right time. Are you guys coming from Texas?  CJ Scott: So, again, you know, that's really mission-specific, but yeah, generally, you know, if we're flying out of Texas, the aircraft has got about six or seven hours of endurance. So depending on the splashdown location, right, if it's on the west side of Florida, you know, maybe somewhere in the Gulf, flying out of Texas is not a problem. Sometimes we need to fly out of Cape Canaveral, so that we're a little bit closer and we have more loiter time in the air. And sometimes, for, you know, splashdowns that are, you know, in the Pacific Ocean, the WB may forward-deploy to a location, you know, in California. So, again, it really is mission-specific, yeah.  Host: OK. That makes a lot of sense. Let's get nerdy with the imaging system for a bit. You talked about that this is one of the capabilities of the WB-57 is it flies really high, and it takes really cool pictures. So let's learn a little bit more about that system. How does that work when you're flying, you know, and when you're flying, how do you point the camera? And what sorts of imaging systems do you, what kind of imagery are you able to capture from the plane? And then, I guess, overall, you know, why is that important?  CJ Scott: So, for, you know, ongoing SCIFLI missions supporting the NASA Commercial Crew, the primary payload is the kind of legacy system, which is a two-channel imaging system called DyNAMITE, and that stands for Day and Night Airborne Motion Imager for Terrestrial Environments, which I really like the acronym, I think it's pretty cool [laughter]. The legacy system is kind of located within the AIRS gimbal; AIRS is the tracking system, so the Airborne Imaging and Recording System, it's a two-axis gimbal system that was originally designed for space shuttle launches. It can change the roll and pitch orientation of the telescope, you know, relative to the aircrame. So it has a really wide field of regard, both in, like, azimuth and elevation; so, I mean, picture kind of a cone of available viewing out of the front of the aircraft, which is about, you know, 200 degrees wide, so to speak. DyNAMITE uses refractive optics, so basically a series of lenses that provide the desired image magnification, and also, you get a really cool, like, continuous zoom capability. There's actually two systems, and either can be modified for use during, you know, night operations. One channel is a visible, and the other channel is an infrared, imaging system. So, you know, if you're not familiar with infrared systems, you know, all objects give off light based on their temperature. So we refer to this as, like, infrared. We don't typically see infrared with our eyes. Our skin actually is an infrared sensor, so you can kind of feel, you know, heat. But IR cameras detect these photons and then turn them into images, so that we can kind of visualize what's going on. So that light in the mid-wave spectrum is really good for acquiring targets at extreme distances, tracking, and then you can infer surface temperature. The visible systems provide really good spatial resolution, so you can get really good detail. So that's kind of the legacy system. The SAMI system, which is currently under development, is a six-channel, multi-spectral imaging system, which uses a reflective telescope. SAMI stands for the SCIFLI Airborne Multispectral Imager, which has been a really neat project. And if you have a moment, I'm happy to tell you more about that.  Host: Please, yeah. Let's dive right in.  CJ Scott: Sure, yeah. So it basically uses, you know, a reflective telescope, you know, which uses mirrors instead of lenses to provide the magnification. Then, you know, the light is kind of filtered into a custom set of prisms, called beam splitters, which separate the light by wavelength, and then kind of direct them into individual channels. And lenses are then used to focus each beam path on separate detectors. So we've got four sensors, which are aligned with the near field of view telescope; that's the reflective telescope system. Those enable spatial imaging in the ultraviolet, the visible, the near-infrared, short-wave infrared, and mid-wave infrared wave bands, simultaneously. SAMI also has a high-speed filter wheel for subdividing the mid-wave infrared channel into even smaller, narrow filter bands. The spinning filter wheel kind of lets us really accurately manage the photons coming from the target. That way, we can infer surface temperature, and, you know, see flow features associated with, you know, launching a rocket that, you know, aren't usually observable with the naked eye. SLS, you know, for example, Space Launch System, will have plumes from the core stage, which contain a lot of water and CO2 (carbon dioxide), and it's really hot. Both of those gases are transparent in the visible, and so, you know, when we image in the infrared we can actually see those kind of invisible plume structures, and then we can kind of see how those are impacting, you know, the vehicle, if they're causing additional heating, or things like that.  Host: CJ, that was incredibly nerdy, and I absolutely love it. Now, taking all of that, you know, here's how it works, right, here's how the imaging system works, and here's, especially the difference between the legacy and the new system; now, particularly with the new system, but really just the imagery in general, why is this important? Why are we deploying planes to support some of these human spaceflight missions?  CJ Scott: Yeah, that's a great question. So, you can actually gain a lot of insight from collecting data from a vehicle while it's in a real flight environment. Generally, you know, engineers will use software tools to kind of model, you know, the physics of the flight that they're planning for: they can use wind tunnels to kind of simulate, you know, narrow regions of the flight profile, but Mother Nature's really good at solving physics problems. And so, what we are able to do using the airborne imagery is collect that data from a real flight, real flight environment, to inform vehicle design specifications. For example, surface temperature can tell us a lot about the performance of a thermal protection system, or a heat shield, right? So for a capsule, as it re-enters the atmosphere, you know, going, like, 17,000 miles an hour, there's a lot of energy which is transformed into heat at the, at the heat shield. And we want to protect the crew from that heat by using thermal protection system, so making sure it's thick enough, and it has the right performance to kind of dissipate that heat, is really important to, you know, for crew safety. You know, if we obtain certain spectral features, it tells us a lot about the gases surrounding spacecraft during entry. This helps us to kind of modify the design tools that we use to make predictions, and explore, you know, other planetary atmospheres. But for human spaceflight, you know, parachute recovery systems are one of the most important and technically challenging subsystems on the spacecraft. They're also one of the highest-risk items, in terms of safety of the crew. So NASA engineers will, you know, collect this, they look at this imagery to evaluate the performance of the parachute recovery systems on a regular basis, ensuring that, you know, we've got a good database of parachute recovery system performance, and from there you can actually develop kind of newer, updated models on just how exactly parachutes work. It's an old technology that, you know, we, that we're still really learning a lot about, to be honest.  Host: Yeah, yeah, parachutes are, kind of do a very magical thing, right? So let's keep looking at it, and see what we can find out. And it seems like you're still learning more and more. All super-critical stuff, CJ, what you're talking about is, I mean, I think the way you described it is perfect. You just, you can replicate a flight environment as much as you want, but it's never going to be quite like a flight environment, as the perfect place to gather such important data. You mentioned this a couple of times, CJ, throughout today's discussion, you mentioned something called SCIFLI; so tell us a little bit about this, this effort here.  CJ Scott: Yep, SCIFLI is the Scientifically Calibrated In-Flight Imaging Team, and we're generally based out of NASA Langley in Virginia. We've got a pretty broad team, with various capabilities from, you know, ranging from, you know, mission support at, in MCC-H, or Mission Control Center in Houston; we've got aerothermodynamacists, to, you know, help us kind of figure out what regions of flight are probably most critical to capture; we've got a lot of imaging specialists that we use to help develop our imaging systems, and tune them appropriately, calibration support, tons of programmatic support. We, and we also can do, like, post-processing of the actual collected imagery. So what you get isn't really, you know, what you get from the camera isn't exactly a temperature image, it's really, you know, radiance, to use kind of a, you know, it's a physical unit, and then you have to kind of convert those radiance values into temperature. And in order to do that you've got to calibrate the system using kind of a known temperature source. So that's how you kind of get from the images to the temperature values. So we kind of do a lot of different things. Generally we facilitate the use of different aircraft or ground imaging platforms for various customers, and we will do the mission planning, you know, try to optimize or recommend optimal sensor settings, actually deploy the, deploy those platforms, collect the data, and then provide that data to the customer.  Host: And you've been doing this for a while now, or SCIFLI at least has been kind of collecting this data for a while, right? You've supported a lot of missions we've talked about a little bit earlier on today's podcast, with SpaceX, mentioned EFT-1, right? And I think SCIFLI even supported a couple of the shuttle flights, some of the last ones, right?  CJ Scott: That's right. So originally, the team was called HYTHIRM, and that was the, that project was started by Tom Horvath and Rich Schwartz here at NASA Langley. And they were doing boundary layer experimentation on the shuttle. So it started with, let's image the underside of the shuttle, where the thermal protection system is, during a re-entry, see if we can get a global kind of picture of what the temperature looks like under there. And it was successful. That led to, you know, follow-on missions where they actually kind of bolted a little piece of metal under one of the wings and were able to image the impact of that little protuberance, or what we call a boundary layer trip, they were actually able to measure the thermal effects of putting a little trip under one of the wings on, on shuttle flights. Yeah, I came to the team in 2017, and since then, you know, we've imaged Dragon capsule re-entry, you know, Falcon-9 launches, Falcon-9, you know, booster recovery, we were part of the Dragon in-flight abort test imaging, we've done SpaceX parachute developmental and qualification drop tests, which helped to, help the Dragon capsule become human-rated, and, you know, we've imaged commercial resupply missions. We were also, supported Boeing at pad abort tests, and also during Orbital Flight Test-1. And, yeah, actually, in 2020, we did an imaging campaign in Australia during the Hayabusa2 asteroid sample return capsule re-entry. So that was pretty fascinating. You know, that was probably the second-fastest man-made object to enter the atmosphere, so that was pretty neat. Yeah. And then, you know, recently, we did a heliophysics experiment, basically imaging some plasma physics that were, you know, there was a plasma emitted from, like, a sounding rocket that was launched out of Wallops Flight Facility here in Virginia, and we were imaging the interaction with the particles, and the, you know, solar wind…really cool stuff.  Host: Yeah, super cool. I'm trying to imagine what it's like for you, CJ. So, sounds like you're very busy, right? You've got a lot of missions that you're supporting. What's the day like, you know, when it's time to get up, and to support a mission? Where are you going? What are you looking at? What's it like for you?  CJ Scott: Yeah, so I have different roles on the team. My primary role, you know, as the deputy PI (principal investigator), I've been really kind of a system engineer, you know, responsible for getting SAMI designed, built and tested. Day-to-day, you know, we're talking with different folks, trying to kind of make progress on our planning. We're always planning something, it seems like. In terms of mission support, you know, it really depends on the role. Sometimes, you know, the mission execution team will be supporting from Houston, be in one of the flight control rooms with, you know, headset on, you've got your monitors, your computers, you're collecting data, processing, processing timing information, etc. Sometimes for ground operations, you know, I'll be out in the field; many times we've been in the desert for many nights in a row, you know, with our telescope system set up, getting calibrated on stars, things like that. I've spent more than a few nights camping in the desert to support a very early imaging, imaging test. So, you know, it really does vary. I get to travel, you know, pretty frequently, which is, which is, it's nice, but also, you know, spending the time away from the family can be tough sometimes.  Host: Yeah, totally get it, but it sounds like you're going on all these really cool adventures. You're camping, you know, you're working with so many people across the United States, you're supporting missions across the ocean, really cool stuff. You talked about really building up the capabilities with this, I think it was SAMI, to support the future, and it has a couple new capabilities. And I think that's what's an exciting takeaway from, from this discussion, is some of the cool stuff that we can expect for missions in the future, particularly with Artemis, right, when we have these capsules returning from the Moon. We're going to have all these very interesting capabilities to collect data on this support for Artemis missions. So, CJ, tell me how, you know, the SCIFLI team and this new equipment is going to help us with Moon missions.  CJ Scott: Yeah, it is very exciting. So, you know, with the, with the SAMI system, it was designed specifically to help assess the heating and thermal environment near the base of the Space Launch System rocket. So, you know, as the rocket is, you know, traveling toward space, the, you know, as you go higher and higher in the atmosphere, the pressure decreases. And as the pressure decreases the plumes, their shape kind of expands out, gets wider and wider. And due to some kind of interesting aerodynamics, some of that plume gas, which is really hot, can actually become, like, entrained in the flow from the, you know, the tip of the rocket, and kind of start to recirculate. And actually, instead of just going away, you know, back from the rocket, it can actually kind of start to crawl up the vehicle, up the core stage. Now, a lot of the avionics, or the, the computers that control the, where the thrusters are pointing, a lot of the avionic systems are near the aft end of the rocket. And so, you know, we don't want that region to get too hot, or else, you know, it could be a bad day. So SAMI's designed to be able to image things that we can't see in the visible, and kind of help us inform what the surface temperature is going to be like in that kind of base heat region, or the aft region of the SLS rocket. You know, again, as things come back from the Moon, they're going to be coming in with a lot more energy than capsules coming from low-Earth orbit, you know, departing from space station. And so, that, that energy has to go somewhere, and, you know, it goes into the heat shield, it goes into the shock layer, or, you know, the, kind of the glowing plasma that, you know, you see on movies and stuff, that kind of goes around the vehicle as it re-enters. So being able to image and collect, you know, temperature values for those regions of flight are going to be really important. Again, parachute recovery systems are critical, so we want to be able to see inflation dynamics, we want to see vehicle/wake interactions, how the wake can, you know, influence how the parachutes are performing, any possible debris contact, or if there's any anomalies, you know, we want to be able to, you know, visibly, or, you know, thermally, see the root cause for any of those anomalies. It's also really, really good to capture these dynamic events, like, you know, heat shield jettison, or drogue deployment, things like that; really helps to verify that all the hard work that, you know, the numerous engineers who design these systems have put into making sure they work, what we do is we provide images to say, hey, look, your system worked as you expected. And if it doesn't, then we also provide, you know, some data so, hey, here's maybe why it didn't perform like you thought. So it's just really, I'm really fortunate to kind of be able to contribute, you know, to the NASA mission. It does feel pretty good, not going to lie.  Host: Seriously, and I think that's the perfect place to end, CJ, is thinking about that. Just what you're talking about is, you're supporting some of the most critical phases of, of these flights. You're supporting launches, you're supporting landings, supporting parachutes, and like you said, you've got a lot of engineers, a lot of smart people relying on the data that you're getting to help make the mission safer, better, more efficient, everything. And that's the work that you're doing, and that's the work that your team is doing. Thinking about that, just, you know, this is a seemingly, you know, maybe from the outside, folks may think that this is a small part of the mission -- oh, there's a plane flying near a spacecraft, right, it's not the spacecraft itself -- but that data is so critical. So thinking about that, your contributions and your team's contributions to making spaceflight successful, and how that all comes together.  CJ Scott: Yeah, it really is an honor to be involved with spaceflight in this way. You know, the old adage, you know, \"failure is not an option,\" right? We only get one shot to get this data, so we try very, very hard to do everything we can to plan for contingencies and all the rest, so that when the time comes, we're in the right place at the right time, with the right sensors, so that we can collect the right data, and get it to the right folks, so they can make the right decisions.  Host: That's some important stuff, CJ, and it seems like you're enjoying it, though. It seems like it's something you're very passionate about, and something you're very knowledgeable about.  CJ Scott: I'm definitely enjoying it [laughter]. There are some perks, right? I get to hang out with airplanes, and spaceships, and play with telescopes for a living. So things could be worse.  Host: [Laughter] All right, CJ, we'll leave it there. This was an awesome discussion. I loved getting super-deep into, into how this stuff works. It's very interesting stuff, and it is critical to the success, and really the continued success of missions, all critical stuff. So, CJ, appreciate you coming on Houston We Have a Podcast today. Thanks for your time.  CJ Scott: Hey, thanks a lot, Gary.  [ Music]  Host: Hey, thanks for sticking around; I hoped you learned something today, and I definitely did with CJ. Awesome stuff, learning about all the imagery capabilities of the WB-57. He's supporting a lot of missions that are going to the International Space Station, as well as Artemis. He talked about the SpaceX Dragon coming down, he talked about some data on the Falcon-9.

                        "description": "Gary Jordan (Host): Houston, we have a podcast! Welcome to the official podcast of the NASA Johnson Space Center, Episode 225, \"Space Communications.\" I'm Gary Jordan, and I'll be your host today. On this podcast, we bring in the experts, scientists, engineers, astronauts, all to let you know what's going on in the world of human spaceflight. When it comes to space travel, one of the critical things you'll need, no matter where you are or where you're going, is communications. Things like sending commands, receiving data, and talking to astronauts are all enabled through a network of assets around the globe and in space. On this episode, we're diving into how all of this works. It's managed by NASA's Space Communications and Navigation program out of NASA's Headquarters in Washington, D.C. Joining us from there is Philip Baldwin, the network operations manager. He discusses how this all works and how we're preparing for the future of human spaceflight in low-Earth orbit and on the Moon, as part of NASA's Artemis program. We have a lot to cover, so let's get right into it; enjoy.  [ Music]  Host: Hey, Philip. Thanks for coming on Houston We Have a Podcast today.  Philip Baldwin: Thanks, Gary. I'm happy to be here. I understand I'm the first member of SCaN (Space Communications and Navigation) that's joining you, so I'm excited to talk a little bit about Space Communications and Navigation.  Host: Excited, but you've got a big task ahead of you. We're going to cover all of SCaN. [Laughter] At least, at least we'll see as much that we can do in an hour. So, big task, but there's a lot to it, so I think this is going to be a pretty informative episode. Before we get into that, Philip, I wanted to learn a little bit about you and what got you into SCaN, and then that, we'll transition that into just what SCaN is. But first, tell us about your history and your expertise that led you to, to where you are today.  Philip Baldwin: That sounds good. I am the operations manager for SCaN. My formal title is network operations program executive, and you know, one of the interesting things is that my dad worked at NASA for about 39 years before he retired.   Host: Oh, cool.  Philip Baldwin: And so, I always had that NASA-ness, that NASA blood in me, where I love the exploration, the science, the technology, and growing up and seeing that really inspired me to, again, to be a NASA person, and have that thought of NASA and what it can achieve. And so, naturally, I ended up at NASA, and I've been a civil servant for about 11 years. I was a NASA contractor for about five years, and so, it's been an enjoyable time, but I'm definitely enjoying the role I'm in now as a operations manager overseeing our communication networks that provide the excellent service to our missions.  Host: Wonderful, and we're going to get into that. You've been with NASA for a long time if you add it up. If I'm doing math on the spot, which I probably shouldn't, you're about 16 years, and your dad was --  Philip Baldwin: I'm coming up on 16 years.  Host: Fantastic! And your dad was well over 30. Do you mind me asking, what did your dad do for NASA?  Philip Baldwin: He had several different jobs, mostly with --  Host: I'm sure, over 30-something years, right? Yeah.  Philip Baldwin: [Laughing] That's right. So, primarily, he worked on the sounding rockets that Wallops [Flight Facility] launches out of their, their launch facility there. So, he worked on the payloads there and the testing.  Host: Fantastic.  Philip Baldwin: But then did software later in his years, and I remember him traveling around the globe, as well, launching sounding rockets in Marshall Islands and Alaska and other places. And so, definitely an interesting career he had.  Host: Interesting, yeah, and an adventure, it sounds like. Very fantastic. Were you always in space communications, or did you sort of progress to, to where you are today?  Philip Baldwin: No, I started off more in a navigation field, working with GPS (Global Positioning System) and formation flying. I started off working in a formation flying testbed, helping design missions that would use multiple spacecraft flying in formation together. I worked on something called a navigator receiver, which is currently flying in a mission called MMS, the Magneto[spheric] Multiscale Mission, looking at ionosphere reconnections, and actually broke a record -- I believe it's in the Guinness Book of World Records for having the farthest away GPS fix, so this is getting GPS signals on the other side of the Earth. You know, we use it directly when we're driving around in our cars, but satellites use the sidelobes is what it's called, where you get signals that are spilling over the side of the Earth, and we're able to use that to navigate our satellites. So, MMS is using that technology to navigate. So, we're actually looking to use that for lunar support. So, I was definitely in navigation, not in communications. I made the switch over to communications; very related, very related fields, but definitely different things. And so I had to kind of change my thinking a little bit to focus more on comm[unications] and getting data back versus how to fly a satellite autonomously.  Host: That's actually an interesting point, because we're talking about SCaN, Space Communications and Navigation. You said they're related but kind of not. So, what is that relationship between communications and navigation?  Philip Baldwin: Yeah, well, you know, timing is a key component to navigation. You know, you need to have a signal, you know, GPS uses timing, they use timecode to get your position, right? We look at pulses, and we time the pulses when it was received, and that's how we get the time delays to determine your location. And so, one way to do navigation for satellites, right, is to get a comm link, a space comm link, to a satellite, and you get the time of flight, basically, the light time, and that's how you do your, your navigation. So, the communications and network parcel we have, where we're sending a signal to a satellite is important, because it can time-stamp that signal reception from the distance to the actual antenna on Earth, and they can use that for, for navigation. And so, though it's not actually sending data, it's just looking at when are those signals received, it's still a vital connection there.  Host: Hmmm, OK, timing. Timing is a very important aspect it sounds like.  Philip Baldwin: Timing is the key, and the more precise your clocks are, the better your navigation is. And so, if your clock is inaccurate, you're going to have the wrong time-stamp, and your, you could be very, very far off from where you think you are. And so, that's a key component.  Host: So, one of the things I think we'll get into here is having very robust systems, robust communication systems. If timing is that important, that means, that means that these things have to work, right? That means you can't be off on that. Exactly.  Philip Baldwin: Exactly.  Host: Overall, I mean, it seems like you said you started in navigation, and then you sort of melded into the communications world. You're exploring both, but I mean, it really does sound fascinating, and it sounds like something that you've dedicated a lot of your career to. What is it exactly that you love about communications, navigation, this aspect of, of space?  Philip Baldwin: Well, it's interesting because when you think about things that are infrastructure, things that are foundational, sometimes it goes into the background and you don't know it's happening. And that's the same with when we think about like our cellphone signals, and they're in our cellphones. Right? We carry our cellphones around, and we basically use them without thinking about how they're connected. It's not maybe even a thought that when you're traveling in your car, and you're driving along, that it's using multiple cellphone towers, and that signal's coming through and it's being routed through, and you're getting the signal. But all you really care about, and frankly, what I care about, is just opening up my phone and having my GPS map, having all those apps I use, and listening to a podcast. I'm not really worried about, OK, is that comm link working? OK, when's the next tower going to come in view? Is it going to come in view yet? Let me wait a little bit to see if the tower's coming in view. And so, basically, it's an invisible network. I'm plugging another podcast there. That really provides that infrastructure that you don't really see, but it's vital, and that was very exciting to me, when I think about that, how we are providing services that are across the board to all of NASA missions. Not just working on a single mission, we're working on all of NASA missions. And so, when I see the Hubble images come back, when I will see, hopefully in the near future, the James Webb images come back, I can think to myself, wow, I had a part of that; I helped facilitate that coming down to the ground, for us to actually see the results of our hard work, of our billions of dollars of investment in space. I have a vital link to that. That makes me proud. I also see the importance of it, so that drove me to the communications area, and even thinking in the future, how can I further help the agency's goals, right? That's lunar. That's obstacle. That's quantum. And so, you know, that's been my driver, that's what makes me excited, and you know, I think it's not often talked about, so we think about the astronauts landing on the Moon, we think about these cool launches, but maybe the invisible thing is the things that facilitate and make it successful.  Host: The things I'm pulling from this, Philip, is invisible, invisible meaning it's happening all in the background, but from what it sounds like is you're touching, really, all aspects of space. You're touching, I mean, if something's going into space, it has to rely on a communication network to navigate, to send data back and forth. You're talking about having an imprint on, you know, Moon missions and telescopes and everything. I mean, you're really touching, touching everything. So, it seems like you have, like, your own fingerprint in every mission, just because of what SCaN is. SCaN is something that is utilized by, I mean, truly everything that we do.  Philip Baldwin: Yeah, yep, and it's a, it’s a nice position to be in to be able to support the missions and be there and to provide that vital link back. You know, one thing we always say sometimes is, kind of more of an internal thing, is, without us, it's all space junk. You can't do anything without that link. If you don't have that link back, it's just going to be flying in space with nothing to do [laughing].  Host: That is true. That is true. Cool. So, let's get into it, then. I mean – and you were foreshadowing a lot of the future stuff, too, so this is going to be fantastic. But let's get into the meat here. What is SCaN? If you had to tell someone walking down the street, who was interested in what is this entire thing, what is SCaN?  Philip Baldwin: Yeah, well, SCaN is a program, where we're looking at Headquarters, and we oversee our communications networks for NASA. That's the Near Space Network and the Deep Space Network. So, we support missions that are close to Earth, ones that are flying around in low-Earth orbit, like the ISS, the Hubble Space Telescope. We also have the Deep Space Network that supports missions like the Mars landing, Perseverance, and things that are going out like Voyager 1 and 2. It's just a vital link in the communications connection to these missions that provide that data connecting the science, connecting space, connecting our exploration, down to Earth for the general public. And so, we provide that link, we provide that communications, we help the missions navigate and chart their ways to exploration. For me, that's SCaN in a nutshell: it's that vital link.  Host: Perfect. Yeah, if I was in an elevator, that would be the elevator pitch, right there, and it sounds like there's two major networks that are a part of SCaN. One that you said, Near Space, and the other one was Deep Space. I'm assuming they are different because they use different assets. Is that a good, is that a good interpretation?  Philip Baldwin: Yeah, that's correct. You know, we recently did a reorganization for our networks. The Deep Space Network was as is, but last year we changed a few things around. We were looking forward to the future, which I'll talk about a little later probably, about commercialization. Previously we had the Near Earth Network, and we had the Space Network. The Near Earth Network had smaller apertures, or smaller antennas, on the ground that talked to our low-Earth orbit and polar orbiting satellites, and we had a Space Network that used the Tracking and Data Relay Satellite system. We combined those to be a more focused network, to focus on low-Earth orbit, and we have a Deep Space Network that remained the same, focusing on Deep Space assets and support. And so, our one really focuses on close, the Moon and closest to the Earth, and one's looking farther out, the Moon and beyond.  Host: So, let's first dive into Near Space Network. You were sort of alluding to it's a mixture of some ground stations, antennas, and assets, and I believe, some satellites in orbit. I think, maybe, and TDRSS (Tracking and Data Relay Satellite System), in particular, I know is geosynchronous. So, what are those assets that make up the Near Space Network, and how are they talking to each other?  Philip Baldwin: So, first, the ground assets. We call them direct-to-Earth, so that's just the ground assets we have, and those are a mixture of government-owned assets and antennas, and also, we heavily use commercial antennas as well, and so.  Host: Oh, OK.  Philip Baldwin: You know, right now, it's about a mixture of 50-50, right, in our support. We use about 50% commercial and 50% government, and in the future, we're going to be moving toward a near 100% use of commercial assets of direct-to-Earth ground stations. And so, we're looking forward to that.  Host: Are they all U.S. commercial assets, or are they a mixture? Are we, are we, Is this like an international --  Philip Baldwin: It's international --  Host: OK, yeah, I figured, right, because you're talking about everything around the Earth. Yep.  Philip Baldwin: Yeah, we want to have full coverage, right? So, you have to make sure you can see all parts of the sky.  Host: Yeah.  Philip Baldwin: And so, we have to have an international component to cover that full view of the space.  Host: And so, if I were to zoom in on a ground station, we're talking about ground stations, right, so what makes up a ground station? How is it run? Who's running the thing? You know, are they giant dishes? What do they even look like? Just focusing on a ground station.  Philip Baldwin: Yeah, in respect to Near Space Network, a ground station basically is the aperture or antenna, a large dish. The largest we have for the Near Space Network is about 18 meters. And so, not, not too large, but definitely a good size to support lunar distances, down to like a centimeter, or a five-meter dish to support some other polar missions. And so, what we have with the ground station is the dish, we have back-end electronics that do all the processing. So, once we receive the signal from a satellite, we have to decode it; we have to process it and ensure that we received it, make sure there's no errors in the data. We have good timing systems, as I alluded to before. We have to have good timing to make sure that everything's in sync, right? And so, that's all a key component. We're not fully automated everywhere, so we do have a crew at the sites, operators, who will view the signals and respond if there's any issues and make sure that things are running OK.  Host: OK, and then when you're sending them around, is it all through different radio waves or are there, are there ground umbilicals or anything that you're sending, like wiring some of the signals to, any different locations, like mission control or anything?  Philip Baldwin: Yeah, so, you know, as we know the Internet is where it's at now, right? We have connections all over, a lot of them are fiber connections, all over the globe, and we, we send that data, connect it back to the various locations. DSN is a little different. Near Space Network is more of a decentralized system, so we send it to mission operation centers, ground control, science operation centers, it pretty much goes to wherever the endpoint or the end customer's at, basically, right? Because our mission, really, is to get the data to the scientists, to the owners of the satellite, so they can process that data and provide it, right? The Hubble, right, if it’s sending a picture down or an image down, we don't want to hold onto it, we want to give it to scientists to process it as quick as possible, and they can use it, and the public can see it. That's what we consider success, when it's available, and it inspires, and it makes progress.  Host: So, you're really sending a lot of the signals. Are you storing anything or saving or archiving any of the signals just at some of the ground stations or when you send them over to different respective sites or anything like that? Or is it really just routing, routing signals?  Philip Baldwin: Yeah, depending on the mission concept we have, you know, for most missions we do a storage for seven days up to 30 days, just in case, right? Just to provide the extra redundancy, in case something happens we have to replay it and send it back out, or there's any kind of issues, we will store it for a little bit. We route it right away, so a lot of the stuff that we do is real time. So, as soon as we receive it we're processing it and sending it as quick as we can, so near real time, I should say, but we do store it for a little bit just in case there's any issues in the transmission back to the endpoint.  Host: Are the ground stations operated 24/7, so you've got rotating crews always monitoring something?  Philip Baldwin: Yes, yes. We are a 24/7 operation, we are always on console, there's always someone who can answer the call if there's an issue. You know, spacecraft emergencies happen just randomly, we don't know when one's going to happen. It happens all times of the day. They're not that often, but when it happens, someone needs to be there to respond.  Host: Are some of these ground stations are in major areas, or are they in remote areas? And what I'm getting to here is I'm trying to think about what it's like in the life of an operator at one of these ground stations, you know? I think they would be in very interesting places around the globe, so I'm curious on what their lives are like in some of these remote areas.  Philip Baldwin: Well, I'm glad you bring that up, because one of the things that we are very thankful is our operators. Not all of our locations, actually the majority of our locations, are in more of a remote area due to, we wanted to stay away from, again, signals, right? We don't want the ground signals, cell phones, you know, TV, anything else to interfere with the signals we're getting from space. And so, we try to keep them away from major cities and populated areas. A lot of the operators will have to live in areas that maybe aren't the prime real estate [laughing], but they do have to travel out sometimes to get to the site. And one of the things we're very thankful for is, during COVID, we didn't shut down. While the world locked down, while the world had to retreat for safety, to be inside our houses, as we were, the operators, every day, since March 2020, went into work. Every single day. To protect not only life, we talked about the ISS, the International Space Station, but also the billions and billions of dollars in investment that the U.S. Government made in space. And we're thankful for that sacrifice they made, because they made that sacrifice to continue to help NASA and to protect NASA's assets. And so, that was a great sacrifice. We're happy, and me, as a manager, sometimes I'm like, oh, man, that's a shame: I'm working from home, and they have to go to work, and so I can only be grateful for the effort they put in to continue to support us and to go into work. This is, you know, ever since the very beginning of the pandemic. We haven't lost a mission, we haven't had any major impacts due to COVID, and we're thankful. That's in great part due to the operators.  Host: That's fantastic, yeah. That's exactly why I wanted to bring it up, I wanted to highlight exactly that, just because of the effort that it takes to, to keep the mission going. We're talking about the ground stations and the folks that are staffing that, and we're talking about some of the ground assets that are part of the Near Space Network. I know there are also satellites. One of them that we talk about a lot in human spaceflight, because it's used on the International Space Station, are the TDRS satellites, tracking, data, and relay. So, what are those assets?  Philip Baldwin: Yeah, so we have, you know, several satellites, and we have a couple that are supporting, you know, basically provide a constant contact, an eye in the sky, to missions like ISS and Hubble and others, and they basically look just like the name says, tracking data relay. They track low-Earth orbit missions and relay the data back to the ground technicians or back to the mission op[eration]s centers or the mission control centers. And so we have them located around the, around the globe in locations that will provide a constant 100% coverage, and so as the ISS mission or a Hubble mission is orbiting the planet, they have a constant connection to a satellite in geosynchronous orbit. Now, a difference from a ground station than from a satellite is that a ground station requires a satellite to be directly above it. That's why we call it direct to Earth. It has to be a single connection straight from the satellite down to the ground. Now, if you're orbiting the planet, and if you look at an image of the Earth, one thing you'll see is that it's mostly water, and so, we don't have ground stations in the water. Actually, in the Apollo days we actually had ships, right, we actually had ships that had antennas on top of them, and they would provide those gaps in the ocean. We don't have those anymore, so what that means is that a mission is heavily reliant on a pass, we call it, over a particular ground station, and that can be problematic. You can imagine for human spaceflight, to be in a vehicle, you're in the ISS, and all of a sudden, you don't have a connection, and you're just there alone; you're saying you're trying to transmit data down and trying to talk to family members, you want to have a constant connection. You don't want to have it breaking up every 30 minutes or every 90 minutes, and so that TDRS spacecraft, which was really focused, at one point, for the shuttle, to have that constant communications to the shuttle missions, provides that 24/7 communication link that ground stations could not provide based on geographics. And so, it's just a vital asset. It's been heavily used by the human spaceflight community, and it continues to be used with the visiting vehicles to ISS, and it's used for nearly all government launches from the U.S. soil. And so, it's a critical asset, and it's been used for many, many years. Very successful and highly reliable.  Host: Yeah, we talk about it all the time when we cover our missions, for exactly that reason. Yeah, there are still gaps when they hand over from satellite to satellite, but they're minimal, right? You're not talking about when you said 90 minutes; yeah, they're nowhere near that, so, yeah, and exactly what you're saying. They're critical to human spaceflight. Are there other space or ground assets that I'm missing that are part of the Near Space Network?  Philip Baldwin: No, that covers most of the Near Space Network. You know, we do have a couple of university partnerships, but we are looking at expanding our network to cover, one of the things we're seeing in the science community is a growing of small sat[ellite]s, and so, when you first think about the Near Space Network and how it was created, right, it came from the old Apollo days, and we didn't have, you know, the focus was on giant flagship missions. Large flagship missions, right? And so, now when you think about small sats, you're like, OK, well, how are we going to support these small sats? And we have these antennas and ground stations designed for large missions like, you know, James Webb, like ISS, and, you know, so what we're looking at now is how we can also include in our support these smaller satellites, because, you know, as we get constellations and, you know, we've heard about the constellations that are occurring in the commercial world, you know, NASA, too, will be doing constellations for science collection. And so, we're looking at how we can increase the number of apertures we have on the ground, the number of antennas, and be able to provide that support to these small sats, which wasn't a philosophy we had previously as we looked at just kind of one-off missions and a single spacecraft, but now we're looking at maybe launching ten science spacecraft that have one mission goal. And so, it's a different paradigm, and we're adjusting to support that.  Host: Different paradigm because it sounds like technology's improving, and we can fill in those gaps of communication with an efficient method. That's kind of what it sounds like. It sounds like it's not, you don't need those giant satellites as much. You can rely on much smaller satellites to do the job, so it sounds very efficient in that manner.  Philip Baldwin: Yeah, and that's what the science mission directorate has been looking at. There's, you know, technology has improved to an extent where you can get a lot of science with smaller, lower investment, frankly, into these small sats that are able to provide great science. You can maybe launch more of them, and the risk is lower, right, so if you lose a small sat, you know, it's still a loss, but your investment is much lower. And so, there's an area where NASA can take a little bit more risk and maybe advance a little higher and get some more science, some great science, based on using these small sats. And so, yeah, it's a different paradigm, but it's one that's been definitely spurred by technology.  Host: Fascinating. Since we're still on the Near Space Network, I want to get to the Deep Space Network first, but one of the things that's on my mind is we're talking about signals, right, and you're talking about signals being sent from ground stations, TDRS satellites; how we always see it, and when we're covering human spaceflight and mission control, is different bands of communication. We see S-band communication, Ku-band, Ka-band sometimes. What are these different types of communication signals that we're talking about?  Philip Baldwin: Yeah, so, what we're talking about is a radio frequency, electromagnetic spectrum, and basically, just a wavelength of light, and so basically, a higher frequency, you know, we have the higher bands; in the lower frequencies, we have the lower bands. Like, S-bands at the lower end and Ka, when you get in the Ka-band, that's the higher frequency. And so what these wavelengths of light allow you to do is to encode more data on a signal, and so when you have a lower frequency, you can't encode as much data in the, in the signal. And so when you have these higher frequencies, your waves are basically going, are close together, you're able to encode more data on the signal. And so, that's why you'll hear, let's say for human spaceflight and ISS Ku-band or Ka-band, where we're able to give a lot more data to the ISS using these higher frequencies. Now, for things like, you know, general housekeeping, we call it, for satellites, that's when you're just monitoring a satellite, checking if it's OK -- are the lights on? are the heaters on? -- just general housekeeping, basically, you can use lower frequencies, because you don't have that much data. You're just checking if a switch is toggled; that doesn't require a lot of data.  But when you want to see 4K video [laughing], when you want to see that high-definition video, you would need the higher frequency. You need that higher bandwidth, which we get in the higher-frequency RF (radio frequency).  Host: You're talking about the lower frequency, higher frequency. I think, from what I've seen, and maybe, maybe, you know, I'm misinterpreting this, the S-band is a lower frequency so you don't have as much data, but you seem to maintain connections for longer periods of time, for whatever reason, but S-band always seems to go through. So that one, you know, in terms of what you're talking about, are the lights on and everything like that, I could see a lot of that using S-band, because a lot of them are critical systems and we can monitor them. I think voice is on S-band, but Ku-band, you know, our video goes out from the space station every once in a while. It's the higher-frequency stuff. Is that true? Is there more, is there any relation between the wavelength and how much coverage you're getting?  Philip Baldwin: Yeah, so, one of the things that probably didn't come across in my comment there was that, for S-band, when we say housekeeping, that really is the vital link. That's the station control, right? That's where you're controlling vital systems. That's the life support, that's the, you know, the power systems, that's the checking the solar panels, checking the control of the actual spacecraft, right? ISS is actually a spacecraft, right? And so, that's where you get those connections, and that's why S ones connected, you know, probably more than the Ka- or Ku-band, because that's the key part where you need to actually need to control and operate the spacecraft. So, that's really the part that's used for the vital telemetry. Ka and Ku, the higher frequency ones, are the ones that are maybe more visible to the general public, the ones that are like the videos, the phone calls, the, you know, exciting experiments, the docking that happens. That's the higher-frequency ones, but the ones that really are the day-to-day keeping the station running and safe for humans, that's the S-band link. So, that one you will see connected far more often and having that more constant contact.  Host: OK, so, it's more so about what the communication is doing, because the S-band is, is a signal for very vital systems. We'll have that connection more often, because it's just a critical thing that we need to monitor, so we need that more.   Philip Baldwin: Correct.  Host: OK, that makes more sense. Alright, so, we talked a lot about Near Space Network. Let's get into Deep Space. Now, what are the assets that make up the Deep Space Network?  Philip Baldwin: So, we have three locations. We have Goldstone, we have Madrid in Spain, Canberra in Australia, and each of these locations have very large antennas. So, we talked about the Near Space Network having apertures the size, the largest about 18 meters; we're looking at, for the Deep Space Network, the largest we have there is a 70-meter antenna. That's about the size of an 11-story building -- large, large antenna [laughing] -- and we have also about four 34-meter antennas at each site. So, those are just very larger apertures, which we need, because when we talk about the things we connect to in space with these apertures, these antennas, we're talking about things like Voyager, Voyager 1 and 2, which are way out there, billions of miles, and, and that signal we get back from them is so, so small that you need a large dish just to collect, just to collect the signal. It's like a lightbulb in your refrigerator. Well, now it's probably LEDs in your refrigerator, but back in the old days, when you had lightbulbs, it was about the power of a lightbulb coming back, and that's just hardly anything. So faint. You need these large dishes, like a 70-meter, to be able to pick up on that signal. And so, you know, we use these mostly for things like Mars, that's probably the most visible things we do, but we also support, you know, things like Juno, which is supporting looking at Jupiter, and other missions that had a great history of exploration throughout the years.  Host: And so, it's really those three major sites on the ground with super-huge antennas that make up the Deep Space Network, and they're a critical asset to filling those gaps that just the Near Space Network, they couldn't pick on signals that faint, or does it have anything to do with distance either? Like picking up some of those cool photos, those high-resolution photos we get from some of the Mars rovers or anything like that?  Philip Baldwin: Yeah, distance plays a large part in it, right? That's just, being so far away, the power that you actually get by the time it reaches Earth is much, much less, and so, you would need a large aperture to, you know, collect that signal and to process it. And, you know, it's a critical difference, right, because one may think that, you know, you could just, a signal's a signal as it is, right, there's no change, but as you go farther and farther out, right, the power that it takes to transmit that energy, basically, you're transmitting energy in the form of radio frequency, it gets smaller. And so, by the time it hits the dish, it's a small, small signal.  Host: For, for human missions, just because this is the world that we're in at Johnson [Space Center], when it comes to Artemis missions on the Moon, would we use more Near Space, more Deep Space, or some combination of the two?  Philip Baldwin: We're going to use a combination. In the recent years we've had, used the Deep Space Network for mostly things like Mars, for deep space exploration. Years ago, in the Apollo days, the Deep Space Network was used for the lunar landings. So, now we're going, after 50-something years, more than 50 years, we're going to go back and use Deep Space Network again for Artemis. And we're going to use a combination of the Deep Space Network but also some assets from the Near Space Network, and we're looking at our loading and capacity, and one thing we constantly have to do at SCaN is to ensure that we have enough capacity to support all the missions, right? We can't just focus on human spaceflight, just science, we have to make sure we have enough capacity to support everyone, so we're adding additional apertures in the Near Space Network, 18 meters, more 18 meters, to be able to allow for additional capacity to support Artemis. As we've probably talked about, Artemis is going to have a lot of things going on at the Moon. There's going to be vehicles, there's going to be astronauts, there's going to be landings, there's going to be a Gateway, there's going to be a lot of activity going on, and it needs to have a connection to a communication asset. And so, we're looking at expanding out, but the Deep Space Network will be our initial primary support for our Artemis missions coming up.  Host: That's such a, I mean, it's just fascinating to think about. It really shows, because, really, I think it's a signal of just where we are, using a Deep Space Network for human missions. I just think that's just so cool, and that's coming up here very soon. I wanted to transition here to talking about, just now that we've really explored in depth what makes up SCaN are the Near Space Network and the Deep Space Network, what are these things; I want to get into more on how it works, how this network is run and managed, because I think, you know, for us at Johnson, especially the Near Space Network with TDRS and everything, one of the things that I'm aware of is, and you've made abundantly clear, Philip, is, is that we're not the only player in town when it comes to using these assets. This is very much a shared asset. There are a lot of players in low-Earth orbit that are fighting for time, you know, and they want to send their signals through the Near Space Network. So, how is this managed? With all of the different missions going on, how do you manage the data that's flowing among all the assets? Because it seems to be quite a lot.  Philip Baldwin: Yeah, so we, you know, we have a great scheduling team that looks at all the requests that come in to ensure that everybody is meeting mission objectives. You know, our primary thing is to focus on mission objectives. So, early on we sign an agreement with the missions to say, OK, this is how much data we're able to provide you; will this meet your mission objective? And we ensure we can cover that, looking at how many assets we have, how much capacity we have in our networks and loading, and we achieve that through our day-to-day scheduling. And so, when we get our schedules, you know, weeks in advance, we schedule up the missions, but occasionally missions ask for more data, which is fine, and we'll fill the capacity with what we're able to provide for them to be able to give them more science return. But it is a juggling act, because we only have a finite amount of ground assets and space assets, so we have to find a nice balance between what we're able to provide. In looking at the Artemis, we looked at it and said, OK, wow, we're going to be behind. We don't have enough capable systems to support it, so we're actually looking at increasing a number of assets to be able to support it. And, you know, just to kind of go off on a little tangent here, back to Artemis, you know, when we looked at even the far-side coverage, not every part of the Moon sees the ground, so how are we going to cover all of the missions that are going to be exploring the far side of the Moon? So, we're also now looking at a lunar relay to be able to relay data, just like TDRS relays data around the globe, we're looking at a lunar relay to relay data back from the far side of the Moon, back down to Earth. And so, we constantly have to look at the coverage, look at the gaps. Where do we need more, and, you know, we can’t do this in a, we have to plan ahead, because it takes time to build up capacity. So, we do projections out ten years, and we're even doing like a projection for TDRS out to 2030 right now to try to see if there's gaps and what we're going to do, and so we really have to plan ahead to be sure that, before the mission launches, that we can support it. Our scheduling team does a great job of making sure everybody's needs are met.  Host: Yeah, OK, so that's how you're managing it, and you're anticipating, just, you're talking about what you're planning for, it sounds like, Philip, is a significant increase in utilization of SCaN and the various networks. It sounds like Deep Space is one of the things, because you're trying to gear up for more presence on and around the Moon. Even Near Space, you were talking about some of the small sats, as well. So, just in your career with SCaN, have you seen utilization of some of the assets change? Go up, go down, stay the same? And is that factoring into some of the considerations that you're thinking about when planning assets?  Philip Baldwin: Yes, we've previously talked about, you know, one of the things that we're seeing increasing is the use of higher frequencies, Ka-band, and so, we have a couple of missions coming on that are going to be, actually, three missions that are in the near term, that will be coming on. So, it's going to be Ka-band polar orbiting missions. One of the missions is going to be 3.5 gigabits per second. That's the most data rate, the highest data rate, we've done at NASA. And so, that's going to be a significant increase in data. So, we're building a Ka-band network basically to increase that capacity. That's going to be completed next year, and the mission launches a year after that. And so, I've seen an increase, and that was a jump, right, so we went from our fastest, our highest data rate, from 300 megabits per second for Ka-band, to 3.5 gigabits, and so a large leap in what we're able to provide, but that also means we need more systems that can provide that support. So, yeah, I've definitely seen an increase, and it's still coming [laughing]. There's more missions on the way that are going to be increasing their need.  Host: So, you have all these different players that want to have this asset. You're planning ahead for that. You have to have some, in terms of the management, right, back to the management conversation, you have to have some sort of standard for all of these different, all of these different players in space that want to use these assets, so do you have data standards that say, OK, you know, we'll provide a signal for you, but here's what we require from you?  Philip Baldwin: Yeah, you know, we have different data standards that we use. One of them, a few of them that we use to make sure everything is interoperable, right? We work with the international communities, government organizations, to ensure that the type of signals that are used are ones that work with our systems. You know, occasionally, we will use other agencies' systems, as well. We have cross-support agreements, they're called, with the European Space Agency. I think we just signed one with JAXA (Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency), the Japanese space agency, and sometimes we'll want to use their assets. When we look out and say, OK, well, we have a conflict, we don't have enough capacity to support this mission, we'll ask ESA, hey, can we borrow one of your antennas for a number of hours? And so, it's important that they have the same standards we have, because if we can't talk the same language then it's not going to work. And so we do have a lot of these standards built into our systems, and we ensure that the missions, when they're built and created, have the same data standards that allow for interoperable communications. That's a big component of what we're trying to do at SCaN is to push for interoperability. As more folks are looking toward commercialization of space, one of the things that's a concern is whether or not we'll all be able to talk together. You imagine again, going back to a cellphone: back years ago, when you went to a different country, you had to either buy a SIM card or buy a phone when you were at that country, because your phone just did not work. But now, you pretty much just go to another country, and you get the international plan, and you're able to connect. That's because your phone is interoperable with multiple networks, and the cellphone industry has adopted that model where phones can interoperate between multiple networks. That's the same thing we want here on Earth and out in space, that even the commercial providers can interoperate with each other, and that's the thing that we are promoting and encouraging industry to take on, and we ourselves are making sure that our systems are open, that we are able to, we publish what our data standards are so others can interoperate with us, and we're looking at industry to follow that same precedent so we can all be great stewards of this great community we have in space.  Host: So, let's go, let’s go into commercialization then, because it seems like this is a very important topic for what is going to be the future of space communication. You talked about transitioning. We're talking about a lot of assets that are NASA-owned and operated and that sort of thing, but you sort of foreshadow from the beginning of this conversation that we are aiming to go 100% commercial. So, talk about the logic behind that and just the process and even what that's going to look like in terms of how space communications will be operated in the future?  Philip Baldwin: Well, you know, looking at commercialization and what we're trying to do for the future, one of the things we've seen in the industry over the last, I'd say, you know, ten, maybe 15 years, is that there's a lot more commercial systems that are available, whereas we now can be one of many. We've heard that term before when we talked about the Commercial Crew, but the reality is, it's true. We can leverage what exists in a commercial market. It wasn't the case years ago, but now it is. And so, you know, we've been asked, well, OK, why are we building when we could buy? And it makes sense. We can work on the next thing. We can work on advancing technology, but if there's a service that exists, it doesn't hurt us just to buy that service. And so, we're looking at commercializing our, first our direct to Earth, our ground stations, simply because we've already, for about the last 20 years, we've already had a mixture of commercial plus government. So, for us to just, you know, pretty much increase the commercial portion of that, that's a fairly simple route to take. And so, and the number of providers that exist in the commercial world has grown significantly, so we're able to leverage that investment that the commercial world has done and just buy services. And so, we'll be looking to do that in the next couple of years here as we migrate on to a more commercial model. For TDRS, you know, a little more difficult. When we talk about the relay satellites that exist in the commercial world, mostly designed for terrestrial use, right, and originally designed for, a lot of them, planes. When you go on your plane, now it's pretty straightforward to get internet. Boats, cruises, remote areas; a lot of these commercial assets are designed for that. Not so much for spacecraft that is orbiting the Earth very fast. And so --  Host: Yeah.  Philip Baldwin: What we're looking at, we have a project called the Communications Services Project, that's looking at how to use these existing commercial assets and use them to support future NASA missions, and so that's a challenge, right, we need to make sure that they can work with our systems. Because when looking at TDRS, we don't currently have plans to replenish our TDRS fleet. So, as the TDRS spacecraft age they'll be decommissioned. And so we're looking at a fly-out of TDRS roughly in the 2035, mid-2030s roughly, where we won't have enough to support all of our NASA objectives. And so, what that means is that we need to have another option, and right now we're looking at a commercial option to replace TDRS in the future, and so that's going to be a paradigm shift. We've all loved TDRS, we've loved what it's done for the many, many years supporting shuttle and now ISS, but we believe the commercial industry can get to a place where it can support NASA as well. And so, we're looking at that now, and we'll be working with industry to assure that is the possibility.  Host: It seems to be a theme, definitely, across much of NASA and spaceflight, is this idea of commercialization. It's shared with a lot of our efforts in low-Earth orbit with the assets there, even we're talking space stations, right? The next space stations.   Philip Baldwin: Yep.  Host: The plans right now are for those to be commercial. Transportation? Already commercial. Cargo? Already commercial. So, it seems to be a model, it seems to be a model that works and that we'll be building on the future -- for the Moon it's going to be a mix of international and commercial partnerships, and it seems to be the way of the future. So, you know, let's all hop on board for all aspects of it.  But you mentioned some of the challenges, right, when it comes to commercialization, especially in SCaN. And so, I think, you know, going forward and planning for that, seems like you've got a decent timeline here to plan for that. What are the major considerations from a NASA perspective on what are the things that we are going to care about as we transition to a commercial model? For example, maintaining standards that can be utilized with all different commercial aspects and all different providers to make sure that we can meet our objectives.  Philip Baldwin: Yeah, I mean, when you look at the commercial world right now, not so much in the, like I mentioned before the cellphone industry, but more of in the space industry of the satellites, the mega-constellations that have been launched recently. Those are not interoperable; you can't use one or the other, right, you can either/or. So we're looking at ways to mitigate the risk of something we call vendor lock-in: when you launch a satellite, and it can only communicate to one type of commercial asset. And then, you're stuck to it. You're basically locked in. That's a concern. You know, not only with the price increases that could happen if there was a major failure in that commercial company. We want to make sure we're able to communicate and interoperate with all of the assets that are available to us, so we're looking at ways to mitigate that risk. Looking at pushing, as I mentioned before, data standards that are open, pushing interoperability. And even on the back end on our side, we're working with missions in designing a wideband receiver, what we call a multilingual receiver, because we want to talk many languages. We want to talk to Company X, Company Y, we don't want to just be able to talk to one particular commercial company, we want to be able to talk to all of the commercial companies, and so we're working on ways to allow for that and to build our systems at the very least to be able to have the flexibility to talk to different signals and data standards. And so, that's how we're trying to mitigate that risk but also working with industry to show the importance of interoperable communications. And so, we're working hard on that, and we're having engagements as we speak with industry on this, and we think we'll be successful.  Host: Yeah, it is a challenge, but it does sound very exciting, and I love your positivity, Philip, for sure.  Philip Baldwin: [Laughing] Thanks.  Host: I want to end with this, because one of the things you mentioned was, especially when you were talking about commercialization, is when it comes to the operations, that's something easily that it makes sense to transition to a commercial model, because there are these assets that exist. So we just have to maintain that interoperability, and we can move forward to that sort of model.  But you still talked about maintaining the ability and the efforts to push technology, and it sounds like that's one of those things at SCaN that's pretty important is making sure that you're always a step ahead and thinking about the latest and greatest technologies. If you can, end with this: give us a preview of some of the exciting technologies in the Space Communication and Navigation network that may be coming to us in the near future.  Philip Baldwin: Yep, sounds great. You know, when people said that we're commercializing, or they hear of us commercializing, they really get nervous, thinking that we're shutting down shop. [Laughing] And that's not the case. You know, our model is changing, our paradigm's changing, but we're going to look toward the future. We're going to look at things that are going to advance technology and provide better data, better connectivity, higher speeds. You know, at some point, we're going to want 8K video from the Moon or from Mars, and so we'll need things like optical. When we talk about the RF and Ka-band, yeah, it's great, but optical takes you to a whole new level of connectivity. That's where you can have that high-definition video, so we're looking at optical communications. We have a lunar, sorry, a Laser Communications Relay Demonstration that's going to launch in a few days here. That's going to be one of our first, actually, our first optical relay satellite that we'll launch and be able to test with ISS in the future. And so that will prove out that concept, and we'll go into optical operations. We're going to do an optical experiment on the Orion for Artemis II, that's currently planned.  And so we are looking toward the future and pushing that technology. But piggybacking on the optical, there's also even more advanced things we can do, such as quantum communications, have that entanglement: we're able to entangle photons as we have that optical communication, we're going to use that for the quantum entanglement, and so now we're looking at how to even do quantum communications in the future, which will be a game-changer for when we look at Mars exploration and human exploration of Mars. And so, we're not going to stay back in the past. We're going to look toward the future, and we have a lot of groundbreaking things that I think are going to change the paradigm for what we have today, and that's where we want to be. As NASA, that's where we want to be. We want to be on the forefront of technology, pushing the bounds. All the stuff that we do will benefit, will benefit the U.S. public. And so, we're really looking forward to being able to provide that, and not only the U.S. public, the globe, as we work on GPS, navigating satellites with GPS, using GPS on the Moon or GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite System), using multiple assets that can help us navigate. Using things like DTN, that is the Delay or Disruption Tolerant Networking; that's another technology that is going to allow us to do something like the internet is on the ground -- why can't we have that in space? Again, why do I have to worry about what our connection is? Let's just have an internet-like system in space. That's another futuristic technology that we want to have, where a astronaut can just send something, doesn't have to worry about where it's going to go; a mission can just communicate to a node, and it just gets back to the endpoint. And so, we are really looking heavily at what we can do to make this all even more invisible [laughing] in the background but provide great service and coverage. We also want to make sure that our future engineers, those coming in with these great ideas, these younger generations, also is excited. And so, we also have an internship program that we do, the SCaN Internship Program, that allows for us to train these future engineers, so they can think outside the box. And some of them have thought about things that were way outside the box, and we're, like, oh, my goodness, this is great, let's use this, and so that's also been a benefit, to make sure that our future generation is excited and can carry on the NASA purpose and goals. And so, a lot of great things are happening: we're pushing the bounds of technology, we're going to commercialize, and we'll continue to provide that great support to all of NASA's missions and even the future Artemis missions that will be happening soon.  Host: Philip, that was, what a way to end, because I feel like, what I want to do is to steal another hour of your time and dive deep into all of those different crazy ideas. Quantum and the Delay/Disruption Tolerant: I mean, you're talking some awesome technologies, and so I feel like we need to do a follow up one just to dive even deeper. But honestly, Philip, this was a fascinating conversation on SCaN and just everything about it, how it's run today and just what we're thinking about for the future, and it seems like a very exciting world. I can tell your passion is, you're very passionate about this world, and I can see why, because it seems like it is very, very exciting. So, Phillip Baldwin, I very much appreciate your time today to talk about SCaN, and I really hope that we can have you on in the future, because those teasers at the end are just too much for me to handle right now. So, but I do appreciate your time. Thanks for coming on.  Philip Baldwin: Yeah, thank you for having me. I really appreciate it, and it was a good conversation.  [ Music]  Host: Hey, thanks for sticking around. I really believe we just skimmed the surface of SCaN, but I definitely learned a lot today, and I hope you did, too.

Welcome to the official podcast of the NASA Johnson Space Center, Episode 26, Can You Hear Me Now?  I'm Gary Jordan and I'll be your host for the very first episode in 2018!  Happy New Year!  So on this podcast, this is where we bring in the experts, NASA scientists, engineers, astronauts, flight controllers, all the coolest people!  We bring them right here on the show to tell you all the coolest stuff about what you want to know, about what's going on here at NASA.  So, today, we're talking about space communications and communication networks with Bill Foster.  He's a ground controller in mission control Houston, and we had a great discussion about how space communication works, what it'll look like in the future, and why it's so important to make missions successful.  So with no further delay, let's go lightspeed and jump right ahead to our talk with Mr. Bill Foster.  Enjoy!    [00:00:45] [ Music & Radio Transmissions ]    [00:01:09] >> Touch on this later if you want to, but one thing that I always wondered about, you know, the Apollo 13, the movie, you see them entering the blackout, and then there's this big tension because they're not talking after they're supposed to be out of the blackout.    [00:01:22] >> This is after reentry, right?    [00:01:24] >> Yep.  Reentry, and everybody's worried and a minute goes back and, you know, the blackout is pretty predictable.  You know when you're going to lose contact, you know when you should get it, so, there's no contact.  Two minutes later or so, they make contact.    [00:01:40] >> Yeah.  But that's a tense two minutes!    [00:01:42] >> So I went over -- I was at the space center Houston the other night when they premiered the mission control film.    [00:01:49] >> That's right!    [00:01:50] >> Which included that aspect of it, and afterwards, Krafton and Kranz and Lonny [phonetic] were all in front taking questions.  Somebody asked them, why was the blackout longer than expected?  And Kranz's answer was, we were so happy to hear them, we didn't really care.  [Laughing] Then somebody finally answered the question.    [00:02:12] >> Yeah.    [00:02:13] >> For reentry over water, there was no ground station nearby, and they used what's called an ARIA, a-r-i-a aircraft.    [00:02:23] >> Okay.    [00:02:23] >> And what they said was, probably the, you know, the areas were always somewhat unreliable in a quarrying contact.  They just may have been pointing -- looking the wrong way or they may have had an equipment issue onboard, but, you know, they came out of the blackout right when they should have, but it just took a couple of minutes for the aircraft to lock up on them.    [00:02:45] >> Oh, wow!    [00:02:46] >> So that was interesting.    [00:02:47] >> Yeah!  Well, how about that?  Did -- are we recording?  Yeah!  [Laughter] We got it!  Awesome!  Well, that's great!  Okay, so for those, yeah, we are -- I have Bill Foster here with me.  He is a ground controller in mission control, and he did -- he's ground control -- at the ground control console in the mission control center in Houston for the International Space Station.  I got to ask him, to start off, how's Major Tom?    [00:03:13] >> We're still looking for him.    [00:03:14] >> Oh, okay.    [00:03:14] >> And we had a big setback early last year, we think we may have lost all hope of finding him when David Bowie passed away.    [00:03:22] >> [Laughing] Yeah.  Oh, that's an oldie, but I had -- I mean, how often can you do that, right?    [00:03:27] >> I bring that up frequently when I'm talking to people, and that's one of the first things, we're still looking for Major Tom.  It's not quite as good as it used to be.    [00:03:37] >> [Laughing] I don't know, I think it's pretty good.  I was dying to say that for -- for this podcast.  But, so today we're going to be talking about space communication, how that works.  You know, when you think about mission control Houston, you know, the center of talking with people in space and other centers, really, how does that work?  You know, that's -- that's really the main question, and the thing I really want to answer.  So, first of all, if you had to describe a ground controller in one or two sentences, what does a ground controller do?    [00:04:06] >> TDRSto toilets.  [Laughter] Three simple words.    [00:04:10] >> Yeah!  TDRS to toilets, okay.    [00:04:12] >> Ground control is responsible for making sure our communications with the space station and any other human spacecraft is maintained, and that's the [inaudible] part of it, tracking and data relay satellite.  That's the geosynchronous communication satellites we use to -- to talk to spacecraft today.  And the toilet reference is just we also are responsible for anything to do with the mission control center facility itself.    [00:04:37] >> Oh, I see.    [00:04:38] >> I have grabbed a mop and headed into the ladies room one time many years ago.    [00:04:42] >> Really?    [00:04:43] >> Yeah, so.    [00:04:43] >> Wow, okay, so that's -- I like that!  So your control of the satellites, the TDRS satellites, and we'll talk about those later, but those -- those are the satellites that are way out in space, right?  23-ish...    [00:04:52] >> 22,300 miles up.    [00:04:54] >> That's it.  Yeah, okay, all the way out there, down to the toilets that are right next to you in mission control?  Wow.    [00:05:01] >> We had a, coincidentally, had a power hit that affected pretty much all of JSC today.    [00:05:05] >> Yeah, we just had it here too!    [00:05:07] >> Yeah, so that was a big thing in the control center this morning, you know?  Fortunately, our -- our backup battery systems and our diesel generators out back all kicked in and there was virtually no disruption to operations in the control center.  So the ISS mission, they lost air conditioning in their room for about half an hour, you know, that wasn't enough time for it to heat up appreciably, but, beyond that, there were no notable impact.  Some of the simulations, like the one that I was on, and the ISS simulation, they were affected, because the simulator building does not have the backup power.  So, yeah, that took about an hour, hour and a half hit to the simulations, but the MCC stayed up.    [00:05:51] >> Alright, all part of your day-to-day jobs, right?  Is maintaining the power.  So you do the -- are you in charge of the backup power too?    [00:05:58] >> We -- we have to be aware of it.  The Center of Operations Director here at JSC provides that power to us.  They -- they maintain and -- and operate all of the systems, the diesel generators, the -- the large banks of batteries that are always online, but if we have a power issue, like we did today, then the GC is the first person that the flight director goes to to find out what's happening, and we'd have to make sure that our backroom support personnel are working with the center ops personnel to understand what happened, and to take whatever steps are necessary to ensure it's no impact, or minimal impact, operations.    [00:06:38] >> Nice.  Okay, well, okay, so, another, you know, a big thing that we really want to talk about today is -- is your responsibility, as ground controller, is the communication networks that gets us, you know, you in mission control, and -- and everyone there, especially CAPCOM oht, talking with the folks in space.  That's really the thing.  So, how is that set up?  How do you go from the headset down in mission control to, you know, whatever the, I forget what the device is called, but where the astronauts talk into?    [00:07:05] >> Well, it's -- it's a complicated system, but, as you said...    [00:07:09] >> It's a loaded question, I guess.    [00:07:10] >> Everyone in the control center has a headset all, you know, our biggest tool is communications, whether it's looking at data coming down to us, being able to send commands up, talking to the crew, or talking to each other.  So we have our voice system that we call, DVICE, Digital Voice Interface Communications Equipment, say that a bunch of times.    [00:07:30] >> Oh, yeah.  Yeah, is it -- you pronounce it device or is it d-vice?  You just do device?    [00:07:35] >> I do device, but some people say, d-vice.    [00:07:37] >> Okay.    [00:07:37] >> But it's just, d-v-i-c-e.    [00:07:39] >> Oh, okay, so, I boxed out the E, there it is.    [00:07:42] >> Sort of stutter into it.  So DVICE is a digital voice communication system.  So when you put on your headset and you plug it into the console, the jacket that connects it to DVICE, and then you log into your DVICE, that's establishing a connection into a computer in another part of the building, and once you pull up a given voice conference, or we call them loops to talk on, when you talk, the DVICE system turns that into -- to bits, 1's and 0's, sends it over a fiber optic cable down to the computer system in the bottom.  Sends it back out to anybody else that's listening on that loop, turns it back into audio.  When CAPCOM talks on it, on the -- the space-to-ground loops, it goes down to DVICE, gets turned into audio, gets sent over to what we call air-to-ground voice equipment, or AGVE, that equipment takes it and modulates it, adds it to the command link that we have going up to the space station.   [00:08:46] So it produces a combined 32 kilobit link that goes up to the station that has two voice channels, and, I'm sorry, 72 kilobit link, has two 32 kilobit voice channels and a 6 kilobit command channel in it.  And onboard the station, the voice is pulled out, turned back into audio that the crew can hear, when they respond, the reverse process happens.  It gets digitized, sent down on the link, sent over to AGVE, turned back into a voice signal, goes into DVICE where it's digitized again.  Goes out on the fiber optic cables back up to the CAPCOM or anybody else that's listening to the space-to-ground and turned back into audible voice that you can hear.    [00:09:30] >> Oh, wow.    [00:09:30] >> So whether you're talking to the crew or I'm talking to someone at White Sands, New Mexico, that's the ground station for our TDRS satellites, or anywhere else in the country, or talking to our counterparts in Japan or Germany, our -- our Marshall Space Flight Center, that same process is happening, converting it into digital signals, sending it through land-based communications lines to other control centers where their voice system converts it back into something that's audible for the controllers on that end of the loop.    [00:10:01] >> Wow!  Okay, so, I'm imagining when it gets through the fiber optic cable to the part where it actually sends it to space, right, so you get -- you get to that, is that -- is that a dish?  I'm imagining a dish.    [00:10:12] >> At a certain point, it goes through a couple of dishes.    [00:10:15] >> Oh, okay.    [00:10:16] >> So -- so from the MCC, it goes out on just commercial T1 lines, basically, just communication lines.  It goes to White Sands, New Mexico, it goes through a lot of processing equipment there, and then it goes into this large dish that's communicating with the TDRS satellite.  So there -- there's a composite K-band signal, and K-band is a fairly large bandwidth signal that we send up to the -- the satellite.  Now the TDRS uplink to the TDRS satellite is much larger because it combines not just ISS for mission control, but potentially other spacecraft users.    [00:10:57] >> Hmm, so you share that -- those satellites?    [00:10:59] >> Yeah, so that one dish going up to the satellite is going to a TDRS satellite that has two single access dishes, and each of those dishes can be pointing at a different spacecraft.  It also has an array of what they call multiaccess dishes that could be going to up to six other additional satellites.  So that uplink from the ground could be supporting up to 6 or 7, maybe even 8 different spacecraft.    [00:11:26] >> Wow.    [00:11:27] >> From the TDRS spacecraft, we always use, for -- for ISS or any human spacecraft, we use a single access dish.  So we're the only customer on that particular dish on the TDRS satellite that's pointing at our spacecraft, ISS this case, and it's sending -- it takes that big KU output going up to it, and breaks out just mission control's communications, which contains the command and voice and video signals, because we're going to also send video or other information up to the space station.  And sends it out on either S band or K band links to the spacecraft.    [00:12:09] >> Wow.    [00:12:10] >> So the S band link has just the commands and voice part of it.  The K band link has two voice channels, typically does not have command data, although it could under certain circumstances, but it also has file uplinks, video uplinks, we can send video programming up to the crew.  Now, the crew was there for six months at a time.    [00:12:31] >> Right.    [00:12:32] >> They get off work at the end of the day, they can't close the door, go get in their car and drive home.    [00:12:36] >> Right.    [00:12:37] >> But just like anybody else, it's nice to relax after work.  So we have the ability to send up sports programming, news programming, depending on the crew, some of them just want to see video coming up from the control center, see the people that are supporting them.    [00:12:52] >> Oh, cool!    [00:12:52] >> So we had the ability to send programming up to them.  They also had a lot of pre-recorded material onboard, DVDs, Blu-Rays, whatever, they can pick a lot of what they want ahead of time, to take up with them.    [00:13:06] >> Very cool!  So how -- I'm guessing this whole thing, right, of sending information on the S bands and K bands, all the way to the...is that instantaneous?  All of that happening, like, as fast as I can snap my finger, or is it happening [inaudible]?    [00:13:19] >> It's happening at the speed of light.    [00:13:20] >> Oh, okay.    [00:13:21] >> But consider light travels 186,000 miles per second, when you're going from here to White Sands, that's not that far compared to the speed of light, but now you go from White Sands 22,300 miles up into space, now you're getting a little bit of distance there.  And then 22,300 miles, maybe 100 miles, back down to the orbiting spacecraft, but, of course, they're not necessarily directly under TDRS, so, you know, it could be a lot further than that.    [00:13:51] >> Right.    [00:13:52] >> So -- so just consider, it's about a 45,000 mile round trip to get there.  Well, now you're talking about a significant fraction of the speed of light, up to a fourth, maybe even a little bit more than a fourth of that, so you are starting to talk about [pause] in the quarter to half a second delay, particularly if it's -- it's roundtrip, we talk to them, and they respond.  Well, now you're going 90,000 miles roundtrip, plus the time it takes for the crew to hear what you're saying and respond to it.  So, if you're talking to the crew from the ground, I've only done this once, and I've seen other people that don't do it often do the same thing, you talk.  They don't respond in what your mind assumes as a normal response time.  So you think they didn't hear you, and you start talking again, and about that time, their response is coming in.  So it's -- it's real easy to talk over each other.  So the -- the experience, CAPCOM, knows, say what you're going to say, wait, the response will be coming, and...    [00:14:56] >> Oh, wow.    [00:14:57] >> ...continue that way.    [00:14:59] >> That's awesome!  I didn't know.  I mean, that -- I would have -- I would have thought it was instantaneous, but when you talk about, you know, the space station is 250 miles above the earth, that's not that far compared to 23-ish,000 miles for the -- for the satellites to go up and down.  So, some recent news, is very soon, I forget how many days, well, at least by the time this comes out, it probably will have already happened, but at the time of this recording, April 13th, it hasn't happened yet, an ultra-high definition video....    [00:15:30] >> April 26th, I think.    [00:15:31] >> April 26th, yeah.    [00:15:32] >> We saw some words on that today, coming up, making sure our ground controllers that will be on console are ready to support that, to go ahead.    [00:15:38] >> Yeah, so does that -- does that use the same network?    [00:15:40] >> Yes.    [00:15:41] >> Oh, and it can support ultra high definition?    [00:15:43] >> Yeah, right -- right now, the -- the Space Station can support up to a 25-megabit uplink to the station using K band.  So that's a pretty big pipe.  But it can support up to 300 megabits downlink.    [00:15:58] >> Oh!    [00:15:58] >> You know, so that 4K ultra video, high-definition video, is going to come through that 300 megabit link down, that same link also supports 6 standard definition video channels down, to normal high-definition channels down, plus a lot of telemetry data, all the voice that comes down, so it -- you know, we're still not using all of it.    [00:16:24] >> Yeah, wow!    [00:16:25] >> However, the purpose of the Space Station is science, and science, sending a lot of the science data down does take a lot of bandwidth, and there are plans in work that are going to upgrade that downlink to a 600 megabit capability.    [00:16:38] >> Oh, very cool.    [00:16:39] >> Yeah, so.    [00:16:39] >> Are you talking about videos for science too?  Or -- or mainly, I guess everything, right?    [00:16:44] >> Everything.    [00:16:44] >> Yeah, like all data and video and audio, everything, so.    [00:16:49] >> Everything in that -- that big pipe coming down.    [00:16:52] >> That's -- it's got to be a big pipe to support all that stuff.    [00:16:55] >> Yes, sir.    [00:16:56] >> So let's go -- let's go back 23,000-ish miles above the earth to the TDRS satellites.  So, you know, we keep -- we keep saying, TDRS , TDRS , TDRS , but, you know, what is that?  What is that network?    [00:17:07] >> Yeah, the TDRS network was established back in the early part of the shuttle program.  You know, prior to that, and I guess you can take a step back to fully understand it, you know, look back at where we were with Mercury.  When the Mercury program came, there was a need to get data from a spacecraft and to communicate to the spacecraft, but nothing existed.  And NASA established a manned spaceflight network putting ground stations around the world, they looked at the -- the orbital track that a spacecraft was going to go on its first few orbits, launching due east from Kennedy Space Center, or, at that time, Cape Canaveral.  And they placed ground stations to cover a lot of that area, in Africa and Australia, Bermuda, across the United States.  So you had ground stations in Corpus Christi, for instance, in California, so when you launched, the spacecraft would go over those ground stations, and -- and if it was a straight overhead pass, it could last as long as eight minutes.   [00:18:21] And during that time, you could communicate with it, but for Mercury, they really didn't have a good way to get the data back to the control center at Cape Canaveral.  So they...    [00:18:29] >> Oh, so this is going to the ground stations, right, not to the...?    [00:18:32] >> Right, so they sent people out there and they had teletype communications between the ground stations and the mercury control center, where information could be passed back and forth to the people on the ground or the people back there.  Well, they knew, as we were moving into Gemini and beyond, that that wasn't going to work.    [00:18:49] >> Right.    [00:18:50] >> Mission control in Houston was designed to have an integrated communications network, which was -- became known as the NASA communications network, or NASSCOM, that would connect all of this together, but you still had the limit that the spacecraft had to be over a ground station.  And because of the way they were placed, for 2 or 3 orbits, you could have maybe not quite half of the orbit covered by ground stations, maybe less, but you'd have a lot of that where you can communicate with it.  And that's how we did Apollo.  Now for Apollo, they also used several tracking ships and aircraft to cover areas where there were no ground stations, but they knew there was going to be critical events happening.  And those were all tied together, and all the data did go back to mission control in Houston.  So we didn't have to send personnel out to the ground stations for Gemini, Apollo, or beyond, all of that came into the control center.    [00:19:48] >> So there were no satellites established at this point, right?  All -- all the information from the moon was going to all these different points on the earth?    [00:19:54] >> That's correct.  When we landed on the moon, when the first steps on the moon, I believe that was coming to us through Australia, through the Canberra, or -- oh, which station?  It wasn't Canberra, but one of the stations in Australia.    [00:20:07] >> Wow!    [00:20:09] >> And all being relayed back to us.  So, in fact, there was a -- a big controversy, not sure it's ever been completely settled about what Neil Armstrong actually said when he landed -- when he took his first step on the moon, was that, one small step for man or one small step for a man.  And he claims he said a man, but you don't hear it, there's a lot of effort, including someone that had tapes from the Australian ground station in his attic [laughing], which probably about 10, 15 years ago were -- were discovered and sent back and I don't think that's still solved the mystery.  The assumption was that it -- it came down clearly to Australia, but it was distorted in the transmission back to the control center.  And I don't think we've ever really resolved that.  So, officially, it's one small step for man.    [00:21:02] >> Right.  Oh, wow!  How about that?  Just a little bit of a -- little bit of a gap there.  I remember seeing that, just because I was trying to come up with a name for this podcast, and I was like -- I was looking through like historical quotes and stuff, and I was like, I wonder if I can take like a, you know, one small step for man, or something like that?  And I found, like, a little parentheses over a, because I guess there was this controversy around it.    [00:21:24] >> And, again, I don't know that it was ever resolved.    [00:21:26] >> Wow!    [00:21:27] >> But we still, again, we still had these gaps in between ground stations that was a concern.  And -- and moving into shuttle, which was going to be a -- a -- it never panned out to be what it was going to be, but a -- a reusable spacecraft that could be launched many times in the same year, you know, 30, 40, 50 flights a year, for the same orbiter.  That would have been nice [laughter].  But communications was going to be even more important and -- and that's where they working to the -- the space network, the -- the -- all the ground stations were part of the ground network.  There's also a deep space network, and when we went to the moon, we used the deep space network that was -- it's based out of the jet propulsion laboratory.    [00:22:11] >> Okay, in California?    [00:22:12] >> Right.  So when you go above -- too far above low-earth orbit, then ground stations, normal ground stations, and their intent is no longer suffice, and you need the -- the very large ground stations, antennas that the deep space network provides, and instead of an antenna so much tracking a spacecraft, it goes across the horizon, the earth is tracking the spacecraft as it rotates around the world, when it gets far enough out.    [00:22:43] >> Yeah.    [00:22:43] >> But the antenna is still moving a little bit, but a lot slower for than something in low-earth orbit.    [00:22:49] >> Were there -- were there large gaps then?  If -- if there were all these [inaudible]?    [00:22:52] >> For when you get far enough away, and the moon's far enough away, there are no gaps.  You handover between Canberra, Australia to Goldstone to Madrid, and those are the three major, the main ground stations in the deep space network, and we will be using that again when we start flying the Orion missions.    [00:23:12] >> Alright!  So, yeah, it would have been -- I went out to JPL back in October, as a familiarization visit, to -- to look at the Goldstone location, to look at their operations at JPL and to start learning how the ground controllers here at Houston are going to be scheduling those assets in a similar way that we schedule the space network assets.    [00:23:34] >> Oh, so the deep space network, you gotta -- you gotta share too, right?    [00:23:37] >> Yeah.  And the difference there, when we -- when we schedule a space network assets, which are used by a lot o of other users in low-earth orbit, we have to forecast roughly 17 days ahead of time to -- to schedule what we think we're going to need for a week's worth of -- of passes, so, tomorrow we'll be sending in a schedule request for a week that begins two weeks from Monday.    [00:24:09] >> Oh, wow.    [00:24:10] >> For the JPL, for the deep space network, you put those types of forecast requests in months in advance.    [00:24:16] >> Oh.    [00:24:17] >> And, you know, one of the things we look at, well, you know, for Orion missions, you almost certainly going to have a launch slip.  So months in advance, we say, we're launching this day, we need this support based on our trajectory here, here, and here, and all of a sudden, we slip a day, and all of that's out the window.    [00:24:36] >> So during an Orion mission then, so, I guess, you know, you'll be communicating with Orion, but then there's going to be periods during that mission, whatever -- whatever it may be, where you're going to have to trade off and maybe someone else is going to have to take priority for a little bit?    [00:24:51] >> It's very possible.    [00:24:52] >> Okay.    [00:24:52] >> Yo uknow, for any mission, you've got periods that are higher priority than other periods.  So you don't have to maintain constant communications with the spacecraft, and we don't with ISS.  You know, we frequently have 20, 30 minute gaps, unless we need to have continuous comm.  Same thing with -- with Orion.  You know, when you're getting ready for a maneuver or an orbital burn or an inner-planetary burn, then you want to have communications, you want to be able to talk to the crew, you want to be able to look at the data coming from the spacecraft, particularly after the burn to make sure that it actually did what you expected it to do.  So, during those periods, we will -- we will have solid communications for as long a period as we need to.  But during quiescent periods, it's not as important, you know, you don't have to stay in touch the whole time, and other users, you know, are out there that, you know, you got to program Pluto, well, they want communications too.    [00:25:54] >> Yeah!  Yeah!  Well, yeah, it makes a lot of sense.  So I'm thinking, I mean, right now, I was just reading about Cassini.  Cassini's going to start making passes on the inner rings and then, you know, make a controlled entry into Saturn to...    [00:26:08] >> Suicide.    [00:26:09] >> Yeah, suicide dive, kind of, so, you know, it doesn't affect [inaudible] or tighten or anything like that, and can cause contamination, so, you know, not to be -- not to be mean, but that's one less spacecraft we have to worry about on the deep space network [laughing].    [00:26:23] >> Well, and you're right.  You know, it's really not a huge issue sharing times, again, for -- for most of the planetary spacecraft that are out there, it's not that difficult for them to plan months ahead of time.  You know, they know when we're going to do this burn in a year and a half.  You know, so they can plan when they need that communication.    [00:26:45] >> Yeah.  You guys must be really good at scheduling, if you're planning that far in advance.    [00:26:51] >> Well, I got to -- got to admit, I admire the people at JPL, because the detail they go to, particularly if they're doing a -- a course correction, you know, want to sling around a planet and get a gravity assess to go somewhere else, you know, just the planning for when to make that happen is incredible, but then you also want to have that communications to verify that it's doing what you're doing.  And, of course, when they do that, you know, when we're talking to the space station, we talked about the delay, it's -- it's near instantaneous, within a -- a quarter to half a second roundtrip.  When you're talking something out of Pluto, it's hours.    [00:27:33] >> Right.    [00:27:33] >> You know, it's literally hours.  It -- it was sort of funny watching some of the Mars landings, and you would see the people at JPL and their control center, and they would get data back that, you know, reentry has started, and they're up jumping and cheering, you know, and I'm thinking, we don't do that!  Sit down!  Behave yourselves!  [Laughter] But, be it, there's nothing they can do at that point.  That reentry started 20, 30 minutes ago.    [00:28:01] >> Right!  At that point, it's like -- it's like a replay.    [00:28:04] >> Chutes are out!  Yeah!  Jump and down!  You know, it's -- come on, you know, but, you know, for us, when the shuttle landed, chutes were out, you know, we still had work to do, and this was virtually real-time, so it's -- you know, you couldn't jump up and down and shout and whatever, but for JPL, yeah, that's okay.  They're watching events that happened.  You know, it may have already crashed and burned by that time, but they don't know it yet.    [00:28:30] >> Yeah.    [00:28:31] >> And, fortunately, in most cases, it didn't, and it lands very nicely and the rovers are wandering Mars, doing great things, years beyond what they were planned to do!  So we got to admire those people out there.    [00:28:42] >> Oh, yeah!  Curiosity...    [00:28:43] >> However, if you go to their control center, right in the center of it, they got this little glass, plexiglass plate with an emblem down there that declares they are the center of the universe.  I don't know about that [laughter].    [00:28:58] >> A little egotistical, but okay.    [00:29:00] >> It's a great place.    [00:29:02] >> Oh, yeah.  So they were using the deep space network then to watch...    [00:29:04] >> Yeah, so they almost exclusively used the deep space network.    [00:29:08] >> Okay, but I would say we use for the International Space Station the TDRS satellite.    [00:29:13] >> Right, the space network.  We -- we use the G and the ground network for space station, very rarely we use Wallops and White Sands and Armstrong, they're VHF radio capability as an emergency voice capability for the space station.  We don't -- I don't think we've ever had to actually use it in an emergency situation, but we schedule passes several times a year to provide proficiency training for the ground stations, and also for the crew and operating the radios to talk to us.  So, you know, we do that, but that's the only time we actually use ground station.  For normal communications, it's all space network, TDRS.    [00:29:58] >> So, the TDRS satellites, you said, you know, some of them are pointing towards the spacecraft and some of them are pointings out towards other things, and this is -- and this is a communication network that you have to share.  But, you know, that -- that's 23,000 miles up, there's -- there's several satellites around the earth, right?    [00:30:16] >> Yes.  there are.    [00:30:17] >> So how many are there, and how do they talk to each other?    [00:30:21] >> We're [inaudible], I say our, the space network, I believe, on their 12th satellite on orbit.  The first one was launched on STS6, back in the 1983 timeframe, I believe.  It had problems getting up there.  The -- the booster that was supposed to take into geosynchronous orbit malfunctioned.    [00:30:46] >> On the satellite?  Or on the...?    [00:30:49] >> Yeah, for the TDRS satellite, it had an inertial upper stage booster...    [00:30:54] >> Oh, okay.    [00:30:54] >> That was attached to it that was going to burn, take into geosynch, then the booster would drop off.    [00:30:59] >> Okay.    [00:31:00] >> And the burn didn't happen correctly.  It ended up in a very elliptical orbit, thousands of miles below where it should have been.    [00:31:09] >> Oh, so I guess it's unreliable at that point, right?    [00:31:12] >> What they had to do on that one, because each satellite has a certain amount of fuel onboard, propellant to basically keep it in its orbitor, to make slight adjustments if they need to drift it to a different part of the earth.  They had to use a fair amount of that propellant to gently boost it up into the right orbit.  So that -- that reduced its overall lifetime, it's no longer operational, but it did provide great support for many years.  So that first one covered the Atlantic Ocean region.    [00:31:46] >> Oh, okay.  So, 23,000 miles up, that's -- you get that sliver, and I guess, you know, they used all the propellant to...    [00:31:53] >> To get it up there, so you get almost a third of the earth.    [00:31:55] >> A third of the earth, okay!  That's decent.    [00:31:58] >> So, and we use that beginning with STS-8, and -- which, before that point, the shuttles were using ground station just like everything else before it, every other spacecraft before that.  So, you know, we had the limitations.  You first orbit, you had a good amount of communications, first three orbits, and then you drifted off range of most of the ground stations.  You might end up with an 8 minute pass every orbit or every 90 minutes.    [00:32:25] >> Wow!    [00:32:26] >> So, you know, from a control center standpoint, you know, that gives you a chance for a bit of a break, but we don't want that long of a break.  We want to stay in touch with them.    [00:32:35] >> That's right.  8 minutes is a long break, but, you know...    [00:32:37] >> So when the first TDRS got up, we didn't cover a fair part of the orbit -- of half of the earth.  Yeah, so starting somewhere with the Pacific to right before the Indian Ocean, you could cover communications.  Then we later put up the next TDRS, and, unfortunately, it was destroyed in the Challenger accident.  So the second TDRS never made it into space.  STS-26, the return to flight, put up for the third TDRS, which became the second operational one, and that closed most of the orbit.  You had a -- a -- sort of a banana-shaped sliver over the Indian Ocean that became known as the zone of exclusion.    [00:33:22] >> Oh.    [00:33:22] >> Where you didn't have communications.  And the biggest problem there is, you've got to, you know, picture the TDRS satellites, they have to communicate through a ground station, and that ground station is in White Sands, New Mexico.  So they have to be able to see White Sands.  So you -- you put one satellite as far east of White Sands as you can, but still maintain good connection with the ground.  You put the other one as far west as you can covering the Pacific Ocean region, but still being able to see the ground.    [00:33:55] >> And then the other one on the other side?    [00:33:57] >> Well, at -- at that point, that's all we had.    [00:34:01] >> Oh!    [00:34:01] >> But we did -- I think there was 7 TDRS that went up on shuttles before they started going through the expendables to put them up.    [00:34:10] >> Oh, okay.    [00:34:11] >> But, you know, we eventually got enough to have spares on orbit and solidly cover the east and west side.  In the late 90's, there was a scientific satellite, it may have been TRN, but I forget specifically, they had a spacecraft emergency.  And as part of the recovery of that, they really needed to have continuous coverage around the earth.  So that zone of exclusion was a big hindrance to them.  And they took one of the spare satellites, drifted it over the Indian Ocean, they brought up a ground station in the Canberra, Australia, one of the old deep space network stations, I think we still use it for deep space, but they put a capability there to talk to TDRS.  And then sent back that -- sent that back to White Sand, so we -- we were able to close the ZOE.    [00:35:03] >> Nice.  That happened when?    [00:35:07] >> I want to say '99, but it was the late -- it may have been, maybe it was the early 90's.  Somewhere in the 1990's.  So when I started as a GC, it was already there, and that was '97, so it was before '97.    [00:35:22] >> Okay.    [00:35:24] >> They -- yeah, we need this, and so they built a permanent ground station on Guam, which is known as the Guam Remote Ground Terminal, GRGT, and so we have that today, there's, you know, and so we have that today, you know, for space station, we have a satellite we call 275, it's -- which is the longitude that it's at.  And we use it to cover the gap.  For a long time, there were limitations to that, for instance, the ground link between Guam and White Sands didn't have enough bandwidth to cover video.  So if we were only 275 satellite, we could cover the -- the telemetry and command and voice gap, but you couldn't get video up or down through that.  Last year, I believe it was -- they upgraded the link between there and now we can have full video service, full bandwidth, so regardless of where we are in the world, we can have a full communications with the International Space Station.    [00:36:28] >> Nice!    [00:36:29] >> There's five satellites that we -- that the ISS uses.  There's two over the eastern region, what we call TDRS East and TDRS Spare.  There's two over the western region, TDRS West and a TDRS that we just refer to it by longitude, 171.    [00:36:47] >> Okay.    [00:36:47] >> And then we have 275 over the Indian Ocean.  So we'll use three of them, you know, one east, one west, and one in the Indian Ocean to cover the entire orbit, if we need to, for -- for EVAs and spacewalks, for robotics operations where we need to have a good link to the ground.  We'll declare a TDRS critical period, and for a period of several hours to maybe a day or more, we will schedule constantly during that period.  If we don't have critical activities going on, then we'll schedule around important events.  If there's a private conference with the crew, we want to make sure that we have good S band coverage, preferably good K band coverage if it's a private family conference where we're setting up a video teleconference capability, then we want to have that K band covered.  So, the -- the ops plan control -- controllers in there that look at what's being planned, one of their backrooms generates the TDRS coverage request that says these are the times we really need to have that coverage, which is given to another position called pointing, which then uses tools that they have that -- that takes in the altitude timeline of the space station.   [00:38:10] Which is important, because you need to know how the station is pointing it in a particular side to know whether it has a good -- a good view of a TDRS satellite or whether there's blockage to some of its antennas.  And then they design which satellites were used at any given time, and that all goes into a forecast request that's provided to my position, the ground controllers, and then we work with the people out of White Sands to physically schedule those satellites for the time required.    [00:38:40] >> I see.  And so the ops planner, that's -- that's another flight controller position, right?  Your ground control, ops planner, they're the ones planning out and they -- they determine those times and they send the information to you.    [00:38:50] >> They take inputs from the increment lead team that says this is what the crew needs to do at any given time, and they pull all the science inputs and the crew inputs and everything into one, big package and have to come up with a plan of what coverage is needed to support that.  And then it goes, like I said, to pointing, who determines what works and what doesn't work.  You know, we have to be in view of the satellite, but we also have to have good antenna coverage for S band, S band is a lower data rate, and its -- doesn't require as precise pointing.    [00:39:29] >> Okay.    [00:39:29] >> So, the coverage for S band is a lot better, generally.  K band is a very much higher rate signal that has a dish antenna on the space station that has to be precisely pointed at the dish antenna of the TDRS.  And depending on the attitude of the space station, there's plenty of times where solar rays, trusses, or other structure of the space station block that.    [00:39:54] >> And those are predictable, right?  So even though you schedule, you prioritize the schedule for, say, a spacewalk, and you prioritize the schedule, you're still going to have little periods of -- of interruptions, and it's because of that?    [00:40:06] >> Exactly.  And -- and because of that, you know, you have two satellites over the east, two over the west.  Sometimes you've got bad KU coverage over one of those satellites, but just because of a slight difference, maybe 3 to 4 degrees difference on orbit, but that's at 23,000 miles up, so that's quite an angular distance.  You may have better coverage over the other -- from the other satellites.  So pointing, they'll look at their tools and they'll say, well, normally, we would use TDRS East to cover this part of the world, but for this particular request, or requirement, TDRS Spare is going to provide better coverage.  :45 Or normally we would take TDRS East until we run out of view of it, and then if we needed 275, hand up to it, or maybe that last portion of the pass is bad coverage, but 275 is good, and since we can do video through that now, then we can move on.  They'll say, let's schedule this for that period of time.    [00:41:05] >> Right.  So there's a lot -- there's a lot going on behind the scenes that creates that clean coverage that we're just not aware of.  There's handovers and all kinds...    [00:41:13] >> That's all the forecast period.  That's saying nothing ever changes, but it does change frequently.  So in the real time period, you know, we -- once the forecast is scheduled and set, you enter the real time period about a week before you actually start using that.  Which means pointing outcomes and says, well, the trajectory has changed a little bit since we generated that forecast request.  Or this spacewalk has been added here, or something else, due to some reason that wasn't predicted ahead of time, and now we need different coverage.  So that then comes into a -- a system where they generate a -- what we call a flight note that says, change up our coverage based on this, and the flight director will have to approve that, and then the GC, my position, will go work with White Sands and say, we -- we need to give up this time, but get this time, and White Sands may say, well, another user has that time, so what's the priority?   [00:42:16] You know, can we bump the other user or, you know, is it a TDRS critical period that's driving that?  In which case, we probably can bump the other use, because human spaceflight has higher priority, in general, than scientific spacecraft.    [00:42:31] >> I see.    [00:42:32] >> But not always.  It -- there's lots...    [00:42:35] >> But in -- in times of like a spacewalk or something, then I guess it would take -- it would kind of trump it?    [00:42:40] >> Yes.  It would -- it would trump it.  Sometimes we have to get the management at Goddard involved to go arbitrate or -- or, you know, help us with our request.    [00:42:51] >> Oh, you guys got to fight over the....?    [00:42:52] >> There are times we do.  And we -- we can never know who the other users are.  You know, that's -- that's their business, not our business, they don't know who we are when we're asking for their time.  So the terminology is a higher priority user needs this.    [00:43:08] >> In general, who are some of the other folks that use the TDRS satellites?    [00:43:11] >> Most of them are like Hubble space -- space telescope, TRM was a good example, different satellites doing earth sciences.  But Department of Defense also uses them.    [00:43:23] >> Oh!    [00:43:24] >> And sometimes when you get a higher priority user, they really are a higher priority user, and we -- we can tell from the way things are being told to us that we don't need to go fight this battle, we're not going to win [laughter].  But if we have a spacecraft emergency, that bumps us up to the highest priority user.    [00:43:43] >> Totally makes sense.  So, we're running out of time just a little bit, but I do want to talk about one more thing before I let you go, and that's, I know, you know, we're talking about how the International Space Station has near instantaneous, you're saying quarter of a second-ish, roundtrip communication.  I know if we go to Mars, when we go to Mars, that's going to take a long time.  We're talking about way longer than just a fraction of a second.  Are we -- are we training for what that's going to look like?    [00:44:13] >> Yes, we are!  That certainly is a consideration, we actually began several years ago with an experiment.  I think it's been a while since we've done it, but we've put delay equipment into one of our space-to-ground channels up to the crew.  We -- only one of them though.  And it was a planned experiment with the crew where we would talk from the ground, and it would sit on the ground for 10 minutes before being sent up.    [00:44:42] >> Yeah, right.    [00:44:42] >> And the crew would respond, and it would sit on the ground for 10 minutes before being put into our voice system.  So you'd have a 20-minute round-time delay.  And -- and they would practice with simple tasks.  You know, and that's depending on circumstances.  You know, a 10 minute or longer one-way trip time is very possible as you head toward Mars.    [00:45:04] >> Right.    [00:45:05] >> The other day, when I was at that mission control film, Dr. Kraft was asked, you know, what the next step for NASA should be?  And he says, I don't know why we're going to Mars?    [00:45:16] >> Oh.    [00:45:16] >> He said, you go to the moon and explore its resources, you're a 3 second voice time away.  If you go to Mars, you're 40 minutes away.    [00:45:25] >> Yeah.    [00:45:25] >> And, you know, and there's a lot of other reasons on that, but -- but that's a good example.  So -- so we're thinking along the lines of, well, right now, we talk to the crew, and we say, they're having a problem, and someone on the ground, well, this procedure says they should go do this, so we tell them that.  Then they go do that, and then it doesn't work, and they say, well, that didn't work, what should I do next?  And, well, go try this.  Well, you can't do that real time when you're a 20 or 40 minute round trip voice path away.    [00:45:57] >> Yeah, you have a problem, you're not getting an answer for 40 minutes.  So you've got to frame your questions and your directions a lot differently.  You know, we -- we want you to try this step, if that doesn't work, go to this part of the procedure, if that doesn't work, go to that part of the procedure.  You've got to understand and think of what the problems could be ahead of time, and you want to package that conversation one way to include as much information and as much alternate things that they can do as possible, and they get that and they try it, and they'll have to package their response back in a similar way that says we did this and we did that and we did this, and maybe this worked, or maybe we got this indication, not that indication, you know, and so instead of a quick, 2 second voice uplink, you may have a 2 or 3 minute voice uplink to them, to give them a lot of options, they can go work, and then respond back.   [00:46:58] So those types of things are part of the planning process, and -- and how do we handle this obstacle?  We can't beat physics.  So, how do we work with it to the best of our advantage?    [00:47:10] >> Right.  So the main thing really you discovered is that talking on Mars is going to be really, really annoying, so.    [00:47:16] >> It will be.    [00:47:17] >> [Laughing] But you're coming up with all the right techniques to make sure it's...    [00:47:20] >> But we go back to the JPL session, you know, when they -- because they send back something say it worked, you can jump up and down and cheer, because, you know, you're not affecting anything real time.    [00:47:31] >> Yeah.  Very cool!  Okay, well, I think that's -- that's about all the time we have.  Bill, thank you so much for coming...    [00:47:37] >> It's my pleasure.    [00:47:38] >> ....and talking about space communication.  Learned a lot, I'm sure there's much more to this topic.  If there's anything we missed, stay tuned to after the outro music here, and we'll tell you about how to talk to us to see if there's -- if you have any suggestions for questions or topics that we can answer.  So, Bill, thanks again for coming on the show, and hopefully we'll see you next time!    [00:47:58] >> You bet!  Y'all have a great day!    [00:47:59] >> Thanks!    [00:48:00] [ Music & Radio Transmissions ]  Hey, thanks for sticking around!  So, today we talked space communication with Bill Foster, and you can learn way more about it if you go on the internet!  A great place to go for more information for pretty much everything, including learning about space communication.  So I have a website here called, deepspace.jpl.nasa.gov, or you can just go and search for DSNow, that's deep space network now.  It's a really cool website where, if you go, you can actually see which satellites are being used for which things in the deep space network.  That was one of the main things that Bill and I talked about today.  If you want to know more about the International Space Station, where we are sending a lot of our space communication now on a day-to-day basis, you can go to nasa.gov/iss, and learn everything about all the latest updates about the International Space Station.   [00:49:13] We have blogs and articles and scientific updates on a day-to-day basis, so make sure you go there.  We're also very active on social media for the International Space Station, on Facebook, it's -- the title of the page itself is called, The International Space Station, on Twitter, it's @space_station, and on Instagram, it's @ISS.  If you go to any one of those, you can find some great information, but you can also use the hashtag, @asknasa, on any one of those platforms, and we'll take a look and you can submit an idea for a podcast topic or maybe you just have a question, and we'll try to address it later on a podcast, just make sure to mention, Houston, We Have a Podcast, in that hashtag.  This podcast was recorded on April 13th, 2017.  Thanks to John Stohl, Alex Perryman, and Matt McKinsey for helping with the script, and thanks again for Bill Foster for coming on the show.  We'll see you next time!"

                        "description": "Gary Jordan (Host): Houston, we have a podcast.  Welcome to the official podcast of the NASA Johnson Space Center Episode 28, Three Weeks in a Capsule.  I'm Gary Jordan, and I'll be your host today.  So this is the podcast.  We'll be bringing the experts.  NASA scientists, engineers, astronauts, all to tell you the coolest information about what's going on here at NASA.  So today we're talking about what it will be like to live and work in the Orion Capsule with Jessica Vos.  She's a crew systems engineer here at the NASA Johnson Space Center in Houston, Texas, and we had a great discussion about how astronauts will operate in the Orion capsule for missions that can go up to three weeks.  Like how they'll eat, sleep, exercise, work, and if needed be prepared for the worst.  So with no further delay, let's go light speed and jump right ahead to our talk with Ms. Jessica Vos.  Enjoy.     [ Music ]    Host: So living on Orion is going to be, it's going to be tough.  How long are the missions that you're going to be living, if you were to say you're going to live on Orion for blank, what are you planning for?  How long of a mission?    Jessica Vos: The longest that we're really thinking, it's designed to do four crew for 21 days.  The longest that we're really thinking, that will really work out, is probably in that like 15-, 16-day range.    Host: Huh.    Jessica Vos: Because once you start docking to DSG, you've facilities there, so you would just basically kind of shut down or close off the Orion and go use your habitat module.    Host: Okay.    Jessica Vos: The much bigger, spacious, better stuff, right.    Host: Yeah.    Jessica Vos: And this in thing, you're going to be on a transport vehicle when you're going that has some sort of a habitat kind of feature to it when you're going to Mars.    Host: Right.    Jessica Vos: So, the just Orion piece, probably the longest you'd really need to be living in there is, it's designed for 21 days.    Host: Okay.  And the 21 days takes into account in case something goes wrong and you need some extra time, or is it just the redundancy aspect of things?    Jessica Vos: Well it was more like the sizing.    Host: Sizing, okay.    Jessica Vos: You can try to squeeze a mission in that's right up to your 21 days and then you just have no margin for, you know, anything, but--    Host: Yeah.    Jessica Vos: But the size of all of the consumables and how much, you know, CO2 scrubbing and how much water you need and stuff, it's for four crew for 21 days.    Host: Okay.  So then more likely it'll be like a 16-day thing. Cool.  So today let's talk about just Orion, living on it, and what that's going to look like.  You know, like you said, the 21-day mission profile, it can support someone for 21 days and what that's going to look like if you were to live there for, you know, up to that much but probably like you said, shorter, 16 days, so let's start with Orion, like what, what is it.  Because we talked with Najude and Morancy about this in a previous episode, but for those who didn't listen to it, let's talk about like what is Orion, what's the shape of it.  Like if you were living in it, what's this house look like.    Jessica Vos: Okay, so basically volume wise you're talking about maybe like a double minivan, you know.  So like if you take the size of a minivan, if you've ever been on a road trip, you try to squeeze four to six people in a minivan, it can be kind of tight, but if you double that volume, that's kind of what we're talking about.  It's about 300 cubic feet of space.  We are talking about putting four people in, and the shape is very similar to what you saw in the Apollo days in terms of that cone capsule, right.  Physics kind of dictates that in terms of when you're coming back from deep space, there's a lot of energy that needs to be released through the atmosphere, and particular blunt body shape does that really well.  So you've got, you know, the wide bottom with the skinnier top makes it look like a little cone.  So, very similar to that.    Host: Okay, cool.  But it sounds like, you said double minivan for four people, that's more space than I would think.    Jessica Vos: Yeah, and, you know, what's even better about it is the fact that you've got all of the volume to work with once you're in microgravity.    Host: That's right.    Jessica Vos: You don't just have the floor space.  You now have this really truly 3D space to do whatever you need to do in, so it's not just the four people in a double minivan in their seats and rocking around on the bottom of the car or being strapped in their seats, it's truly floating within that space, so.    Host: Okay.  So you got this double minivan sort of space, let's-- how about the lay of the land.  I'm imaging the one in building nine is the mockup of it.  Once you enter through that hatch, what are you looking at, like where are the seats, where are the screens, where is all that stuff?    Jessica Vos: Yeah, so we are fortunate enough to have a full-scale Orion mockup here in building nine at Johnson Space Center, and the space vehicle mockup facility it's like a big playground for spacecraft.  When we enter our mockup, you enter through the side hatch, and as you enter, you first step on a step.  And when you get in, you'll see there's a little bit of a space between your foot and the seat pan, the leg pan of the seats for the crew.  And there are four of those seats aligned two and two.  So two of them kind of, they don't stack like lay on top of each other like bunk beds, it's not like that.  But they're aligned two and two in like rows to your left.    Host: Okay.    Jessica Vos: If the crew were laying in their seats to see you as you come into the side hatch, they would need to turn their heads to the right.    Host: Okay.    Jessica Vos: So their feet--    Host: So the first, yeah, the first thing you see are their feet, and their heads are kind of towards the wall.    Jessica Vos: Right, yep.    Host: Okay.    Jessica Vos: So their legs are kind of oriented towards the center of the spacecraft, and their heads are toward the outside so that their heads can line up pretty much directly underneath the displays and controls as well as the windows.    Host: Oh.    Jessica Vos: So without moving their head a whole lot, they have visibility to look out the windows for orientation during, you know, dynamic phases of flight and understanding where they are relative to the stars, through the window, and then they also have all of the information that they need to execute those maneuvers on the displays and controls right in front of them.  It also is, a real interesting thing about that design of the seats, they don't have to do a whole lot of manipulation, like if you think about, oh, well why don't we do really super fancy touch screens.  Well, if you're in a vibration environment like during launch, your hands are really heavy actually, and your fingers are going to be moving around if you unstrap them from that seat and then try to go touch the screen.    Host: Right.    Jessica Vos: So they much prefer, of course, the switches and the dials and the buttons, which we have on the outer edges of our displays and controls.  We recently did some testing.  It was just, I think it was last year, about this time last year, where we did a legibility under vibration test with the crew, and so you had the whole system of the seat, the suit, and the human all vibrating under what we would determine, what we had determined to be our launch loading condition, the vibration condition, and then they have to tell us basically are they able to read the screen and execute what they're supposed to be doing based on those commands under the vibration condition.  So the whole point is that they're able to do what they need to be doing under all the dynamic phases of flight.  So the seat is, the design is for that purpose.    Host: All right.  Yeah, I'm imagining like a, I don't know if you've ever been like in the car or something, you see the clock like going up and down, like the digital clock, and it's really hard to read, and you're like what time is it.    Jessica Vos: And if you do need to reach and push the button next to the clock like can you, you know.  Are you going to push the right one.    Host: That's true, because when they're launched, you got all this weight on you.    Jessica Vos: So then after that you got the, you got the screens.  So then they have these buttons around the screens, right, that you can press?    Host: Yep.  So that's, and that's part of the design, right, three screens?    Jessica Vos: Yes, that is part of the design.  You've got two people monitoring those three screens, so you've got a little bit of that kind of ability for both people to operate both screens.  Now, I would say two screens at a time.  So that middle screen, you're going to get people being, reach and access wise, those two crew members, you know, copilot and pilot are going to be able to both see and touch at least those two screens in front of them, and then you kind of got the outer screens being monitored by one person at a time.    Host: Okay.    Jessica Vos: The switches are very important.  That's what gives them that tactile feedback of knowing that they actually done something while they're wearing, while they have their gloves on.  So it's easy for us, you know, with the fancy iPhones to just really gently feel a tap on the home screen button, right.    Host: Yeah.    Jessica Vos: But that's the same when you've got layers of a suit going around your hands, right.  So for them to know that they indeed have actuated something, they really like that switch feel.  And so there are specific designs around how those switches feel to the crew member to make sure that they know that they have in fact actuated what they were supposed to actuate.    Host: Yeah.  It's the space version of responsive design, where like, as if your phone, but a lot of other things to consider.    Jessica Vos: Yep.    Host: Awesome.  So that's like the, that's the pilot area, and that's where you would, you would, I guess, quote unquote fly Orion, right.  So then, so is the rest of the area that you're looking at, like you said when you go through the hatch, this whole area, is that the living area or is there more?    Jessica Vos: So there is space that's up back behind their heads.    Host: Okay.    Jessica Vos: And, now recall that the ECLS wall, ECLS is environmental control and life support, so there's like a wall back there that houses all of that equipment, and then in front of that is a bunch of stowage, a bunch of webbing kind of material.    Host: Yeah.    Jessica Vos: Like you know kind carabineer or hook to different D-rings in places to kind of stow stuff in and kind of keep it stowed back there.  Underneath the pallet, the floor, underneath the floor is more stowage.  That is also where some of the avionics bays are, I believe, and then some of the other systems for the vehicle that humans require such as the waste management system.    Host: Very important.    Jessica Vos: Very important.  So, yeah, somehow it all squeezes in there.    Host: Okay.  And that's really the, that's really what Orion is, is trying to, trying to get, you know, like this camper that you're going to be living in for 16, 21 days, whatever, and just squeeze all this stuff in that you need for all of that stuff, knowing that it's not like you can stop at a convenience store or gas station along the way to pick anything up.    Jessica Vos: Exactly.  In fact, as I speak to you this afternoon, there's a team of engineers at one of the off-site mockup facilities that are doing a stowage evaluation.  So they're literally right now playing that 3D game of Tetris and trying to figure out where all this mass and stuff is going to go.  Because you also have to think about the CG of the vehicle, both on launch and on landing, it's got to be very specific, so things have to be put in certain places.  And then there's also another very good consideration or important consideration, and that is, with respect to reach and access with the crew coming home and going through this dynamic phase of flight, there are certain things that you're going to want them to be able to get to pretty much right away.  So there's some stowage that is literally right on their seats.  There's stowage of things that's right next to them or such that one particular crew member can get there in a very quick amount of time.  So it's not like you can just put stuff wherever you want to.  There's also consideration, right, for not storing things like food next to things like the [inaudible].  So it gets tricky, and so they redo these evaluations as the designs for all of this equipment, crew equipment matures.    Host: All right.  Yeah, I'm going to have to, I'm going to have to get some tips from you for my dad because to, how to pack a camper for a camping trip, to make it the most efficient way possible.  He could definitely appreciate that because he's an expert packer, but not compared to an Orion crew system [inaudible].    Jessica Vos: Yeah, these guys have got it down, I'm telling you.    Host: Wow, all right.  So obviously, you know, you're maximizing the limited space that you have and thinking about every component about where things are stored and where things are, so, you know, the living portion of things, right.  What is, what's the lay of the land for, you know, now you can get out of your seat, and it's time to go do stuff.  Where is everything else?  Like food.    Jessica Vos: So there is a series of lockers both on that kind of ECLS wall that I was telling you about and a few more underneath the pallet on the floor, and I think portions of the food are stored in both of those places if I understand correctly.  It could be that all of it maybe went in one of lockers underneath the seats now that I'm thinking about it, but they need to, they're each stored-- the way that the food is going to be stored is very similar to what we see currently on the space station, which is that they're flown up in very specific sized compartments.  I think they call them CTBs, and they'll be organized either by crew member or by, you know, type of food that it is, and each of those gets put into a certain locker and given a certain, you know, spot to be.    Host: Yeah.    Jessica Vos: That's the same for a lot of the equipment actually.  It's just, it's all going to be in a particular locker.  There's a few different sizes of lockers and a few different kind of orientations, but it's all stowed away.  I think more interestingly there is the exercise device, and the exercise device is this neat little box that is going to be, going to serve as the step to the side hatch as well.  So in zero gravity, of course you don't need a step, right, to do anything with the side hatch.  You're not using the side hatch.  You really don't want that hatch to open on orbit.  But on landing, when the crew is somewhat deconditioned after having been in microgravity for 16 to 21 days, they might need a step to get up and over that edge.  So the idea is that this box that's taking up space serves two functions.  It's going to be the step to allow the crew to get in and out, and the recovery crew as well, and it's the exercise device.   And right now the exercise device is planned to be, it's kind of cool because it doesn't require any power.  It's just a flywheel-based device that's got some smart settings to it that allow the crew to execute different prescriptions that the ASCRs give them.  That's the astronaut strength and condition rehabilitation specialist I think.    Host: Got to have acronyms.    Jessica Vos: The ASCRs.  They provide the exercise prescriptions, and that one box alone will allow the crew members to get at least 30 minutes of exercise activity that will challenge their cardiovascular systems and their musculoskeletal systems as required, so--    Host: All right.    Jessica Vos: Yeah.    Host: So a little tiny box, and it's kind of like a, I'm imagining a rowing machine, right, that you would see in the gym, kind of like that, but obviously more advanced so it can do aerobic and resistive exercise, meet all the needs that you need.    Jessica Vos: Right.    [00:19:52] Host: Because the space station right now has the advanced resistive exercise device--    Jessica Vos: Absolutely.    Host: Which is like a big weightlifting machine.  You don't have room for that.    Jessica Vos: No, we don't have room for that.  [laughter]    Host: And it's got a treadmill, I mean, from what Nujoud said, you could potentially stand up, right, if you were to like touch the base, like there's enough room where you can stand up straight?    Jessica Vos: Yes, yes.  You can.  I believe, I know I can, but I'm only five three.    Host: Oh, okay.    Jessica Vos: So I don't know that the, I believe the crew module is sized for I think up to a six four individual.    Host: Wow.    Jessica Vos: If I'm correct.    So, yeah, you don't have to be particularly short.  You will, you know, there is limits to which seat we can put you in if you are on that taller edge.    Host: Oh.    Jessica Vos: But, and I do believe that I think somebody at least up to six foot would be able to, like Nujoud said, stand in the center of the capsule.    Host: Wow.    Jessica Vos: But you're right, when you're rowing, you're still going to get into a standing stature position, but in zero gravity, we're going to have you do it through the center of the spacecraft.    Host: So you're not going up to the tip of the cone, right, you're going, yeah.    Jessica Vos: You're not going up, yeah, you're not going up to where the docking hatch is on the top at the very, at the tip, you're going to the other side of the spacecraft.  So you're starting at the side hatch, right underneath the side hatch, and you're extending your body long out to the other side of the spacecraft.    Host: Ah, okay.  So that's, so that takes up a decent amount of real estate, right, that's the, that's the working out real estate.    Jessica Vos: It sure does.    Host: And where is everyone else while someone is working out?  I guess they're all in the same room, right.    Jessica Vos: Yeah, they absolutely are.  And it's funny because when you think about how much time is really going to spent each day when you have four crew members doing at least 30 minutes each, it's like a couple hours that that person is going to be basically occupying a good chunk of the space while they exercise, and everyone else is going to have to be kind of staying out of the way, right.    Host: Yeah.    Jessica Vos: So it's going to be interesting.    Host: Plus the noise, I'm thinking of a rowing machine, right.  So plus the noise of rump, rump, for hours.    Jessica Vos: Oh yeah, absolutely.  That's a good topic actually.    Host: Really?    Jessica Vos: There are several acoustic requirements imposed on every system that goes into the cabin for just that reason.  Like it's very hard to concentrate and focus and get real work done, right, if you are constantly, you know, having to deal with a buzz.  You know how annoying that can be.    Host: Yeah.    Jessica Vos: So there are a lot of acoustic requirements placed on all of the different systems that have to be continuously operating, and yeah, the exercise device is one of them absolutely.    Host: So there's an acoustic, it has to be, it can't exceed like this noise level or something.    Jessica Vos: Yep.    Host: Interesting.    Jessica Vos: Yeah.    Host: So have you simulated something, like an environment where people are living in Orion for a couple days already, or is that still to come, like so you can understand the acoustic environment and say, hey, that's annoying or something like that.    Jessica Vos: So there hasn't been, there has not been to my knowledge any day in the life of type of tests specific to the Orion capsule.  However, there have been a series of analogue tests being done in terms of the isolated environment.  So right here at Johnson Space Center, the human research program owns the HERA, which is the Human Exploration Research Analogue.    Host: Yeah.    Jessica Vos: And they do study how humans behave in isolation and the effects on team dynamics, and they try to stress them out a little bit, right, and try to see how they can improve on the team dynamics basically.  It's very BHP, behavioral health and performance oriented, not as much as hey, you know, is the Orion design adequate or sufficient.  We haven't gotten to that point with the Orion design yet in terms of verification and validation.  We will with EM1 and EM2.  We've got sensors on the EM1 mission that uses the Orion capsule that will measure acoustics and radiation and all that good stuff.  But in terms of the people aspect, we study it here through the human research program in HERA, and unfortunately the volume of that is just way beyond what-- it's huge in there.    Host: Yeah.    Jessica Vos: So they have way more volume in space to live and work in.    Host: Yeah.    Jessica Vos: The acoustics though I would say is probably one of the things that they do tweak to try to see if it stresses the crew out, but I couldn't speak to the results of that, but I'm sure that it's one of the things that they try to tweak, as a variable, to see what kind of impacts in terms of stress it has on the crew.    Host: Definitely, we actually just had Lisa Spence and Paul Haugen here earlier today to talk about HERA, and by the time this comes out, I believe there's the HERA episode already, Space Habitats.    Jessica Vos: Awesome.    Host: So there should already be a little bit more anybody that, and I was picking her brain, but obviously there's still, there's still researching.  They still have to collect the data--    Jessica Vos: Oh, yeah.    Host: So they haven't, they haven't like, you know, consolidated everything into a published paper quite yet, and more to come, but absolutely, totally transferrable to an Orion environment.  The human element to that.    Jessica Vos: Yep, yep.    Host: So, what other sorts of living systems are on, are on Orion.  I guess, well, okay, I'll lead in the right direction for, for example, environmental, right.  So to live you have to, you know, you're in space, but it's got to be a certain temperature, right?    Jessica Vos: Yeah.    Host: You got to have oxygen and carbon dioxide removal and stuff like that.    Jessica Vos: Yeah, those humans are rather picky, right.  Like we take an exact just so much of a temperature swing or a pressure swing, and we just get uncomfortable really fast.  So, there's comfort and survival, right.    Host: Yeah, yeah.    Jessica Vos: So, Orion will be pressurized at 14.7 pounds per square inch, or PSI, which is exactly what you would see here in Houston, Texas, because we live pretty much at sea level.  So that's fantastic.    Host: Yeah.    Jessica Vos: We don't really have to deal with any sort of feelings or impacts to performance due to changes in pressure.    Host: Cool.    Jessica Vos: The air is also the exact same concentration of oxygen and nitrogen and all the rest of the trace contaminants, well we should be cleaner, honestly.  But, yeah, so we're looking at 21 percent oxygen and the rest nitrogen for the most part, so.    Host: All right.  So it's, okay, so it's emulating all of that, and all of this is in a tiny, is the environmental systems, do they have to be designed to be more compact, or was it kind of a cut and paste sort of technology?    Jessica Vos: Great question.  So I believe that what we are flying on Orion is a fairly new and more compact system.  It is a mean swing bed, it's a solid mean swing bed technology, which we have three units, and it's designed to be, as most systems are on this spacecraft, anything that's needed in different nominal missions, and nominal mission duration for four crew for 21 days, we try to design redundancy into, so that if something happens and you're just not quite sure what it was, okay, you know what, we're going to switch to this other thing instead, or we're just going to use the second one that we, you know, built into the system.  So that's how the ECLS system is.  We have three units, and each unit has two beds that swing.  So, what the purpose of the solid mean is to basically remove the CO2 from the air.  There's other kinds of filters within that system that'll take out other types of contaminants, but the main thing that we really worry about from a human health perspective and human performance perspective is that CO2. So, it'll take out the CO2.  It basically attaches, the solid mean is really sticky.  It likes the CO2, and then when we flip the bed and expose it to vacuum, all of it goes away.    Host: Wow.    Jessica Vos: Yeah, so once the bed is full, you turn around and expose it to vacuum, I think it's like 20 minutes or something max, and then you flip it around again, and we have three different units that do that same process.    Host: All right.    Jessica Vos: Yeah.    Host: All right.  So, pretty efficient then, I would guess, right?  Because you're right, you built in the redundancy.    Jessica Vos: Yep.    Host: And talking with Nujoud before, that redundancy is built like, all right, we can have this amount, but if we go, if we do, you know, more redundant systems, then that's more weight, so what's the right amount, and then, boom, you locked in on the three, you said, right.    Jessica Vos: Yep.    Host: Yeah, very cool.    Jessica Vos: Yep, and like every single system has to have that trade of how much tolerance you're going to build into it.  Some systems we just say, you know what, we're going to have to, we can't afford it, we're going to have to fly in terms of mass.  We don't have the spare mass for this one versus this other more important one that we need the mass for, so we are going to decide to control it via operational controls in flight instead.  Just make sure that we only operate it for this much time or we only use it for this much, and you can, you know, there are, those are some of the other ways that you can manage the resources and the consumables that you don't have extra of, right.    Host: Yeah.    Jessica Vos: Power is like that quite a bit.  It's the same way on the space station right now.    Host: Yeah.    Jessica Vos: Like you have to know exactly what you're plugging into and how long you're plugging into it because you could short something else out over here, you know, so.    Host: So, I'm guessing Orion has power constraints too, right.    Jessica Vos: Yeah.    Host: Is it going to be solar powered?    Jessica Vos: Yes.    Host: Okay.  Very cool.  So how is the solar panels now.  Because I've seen various pictures in the past of, you know, you got the ones that are more circular and ones that are more like an X.    Jessica Vos: We're the X.    Host: We're the X now.    Jessica Vos: Yeah.    Host: Cool, I like that one.    Jessica Vos: Yeah, yeah, we are the X. We've got four.    Host: Sweet.    Jessica Vos: You know, that kind of do the pretty unfolding thing.    Host: All right.    Jessica Vos: So, yeah, but they go, they extend out fairly long, I don't know the exact numbers, but yeah.    Host: Okay, and that will, it'll be solar powered and--    Jessica Vos: Um-hum.    Host: Okay, very cool.  So another big one that I know about is, and you were talking about all of the important stuff being around, the waste management, right.    Jessica Vos: Um-hum.    Host: Right.  So you're going to be on there in the one room with four people for quite some time.    Jessica Vos: Yep.    Host: So how is the bathroom situation?    Jessica Vos: Tiny.  It is a very tiny, like smaller than a telephone booth like closet thing.    Host: All right.    Jessica Vos: It is very tiny, and it's really funny too because I believe as it's oriented right now, just because you only have so much room in the spacecraft, right, I think the exercise device sits right above the door for the WM.    Host: No.    Jessica Vos: So you may have to interrupt somebody's exercise session to go in and then, you know, interrupt it again to get out, so you know.  But, you know, that's what it's like when you're camping and living in a camper.  That's how things go.  So--    Host: It's true.    Jessica Vos: But, yeah, the design of the actual system itself, of the potty itself, is similar in, you know, concept to what we use on station today.    Host: Okay.    Jessica Vos: It's basically purposely driven airflow that's being intentionally directed in a certain way, you know, to help stuff get out and not get all over the place.    Host: Also very important.    Jessica Vos: Yes.  And then it gets contained into a canister that's got some odor control features to it, and then once that canister gets full, it can be sealed and closed off and then you stick a brand-new one in, and so--    Host: All right.    Jessica Vos: It's kind of a fancy bucket with a hose on the end of it and some odor-control features.    Host: Hey, that's going to come in handy, because that's right next to the exercise [inaudible].    Jessica Vos: Yes, I know.    Host: That whole area, I know I would hang out on the other side if I was at Orion for the most part for sure.    Jessica Vos: But, yeah, in general I'm not sure that there's a whole lot of privacy going to be offered on this vehicle.  I mean, of course there's always the option of hanging up your sleeping bag.  I mean you had a question about that, and it's really more of just a blanket with Velcro straps on it that allow you to adjust the squeezability, right, how tight it is on your body, and then some D-rings to adhere it to some pieces of structure so that you don't go floating off into each other when you're sleeping.  But there is the option of hanging that up, you know, putting the D-ring up, or getting it unfolded and sticking out so that you want to be behind it.  But I'm just, I can't imagine that with 21 days of taking that much time and energy to make sure that you get, you know, behind your little curtain, I don't know.    Host: Well, you know what, I would assume with a crew of four astronauts that are going on these missions, I would assume that they are going to be a very tight-knit group of people.    Jessica Vos: Yeah.    Host: And just talking with space stations astronauts and even HERA, just talking with them too, whenever you're with people in these environments, you learn to, you know, teamwork is very important.  Camaraderie is very important, and all of that sort of translates into if you're going to the bathroom, respect each other, so--    Jessica Vos: Yeah.  Absolutely.    Host: Yeah.  Just out of curiosity, I’m thinking about the movie Apollo 13. So when they were on that trip, they didn’t have the water recycling system that we have on the International Space Station, they literally ejected it out into space. And it had this sort of cool crystal effect as it was floating away. Is that what’s going to happen on Orion?  Jessica Vos: It absolutely is.    Host: Ah that is so cool.  Jessica Vos: Yeah, I’m not sure that they’re going to be able to see it the same way. You know, just based on where the windows are and where that ejection port it, but – or the evacuation port I guess – but that’s how we’re going to do it.  Host: Ah, okay. I hope they get some good views – this kind of sounds weird to say – but it is kind of cool to see the crystallization of pee.  Jessica Vos: Yeah, so I’ve heard!  Host: Very cool.  There's a, you know, one thing I was thinking about actually is, we just moved right from flying the thing and like how, where everyone's going to be sitting to just kind of living, but I know there's going to be a launch and entry suit that you have to wear at first, right.  So these bulky like orange suits, right.  It's kind of like the, it's an upgraded, new, fancy pumpkin suit, right.    Jessica Vos: Right.    Host: Kind of.  So once you're wearing that and now you're in orbit and now you're transitioning to living on Orion, where does that pumpkin suit go?    Jessica Vos: So it has, it has another locker.    Host: A locker, okay, cool.    Jessica Vos: Yeah, just another locker, but that suit becomes really important in some of the, on orbit, in the event that some emergency happens like a depressed cabin, so if something happens that causes your cabin to depress for any reason, all of the systems in there including the food system and everything are meant to be, to provide for 144 hours of depressurized cabin survival.    Host: Oh, okay.    Jessica Vos: So 144 hours, basically six days.    Host: Yeah.    Jessica Vos: That's kind of like, yeah, worst case you're on the far side of the moon and something happens, your cabin depresses, and you have six days until you can get home.    Host: From the far side of the moon though, how long until you get home?    Jessica Vos: Six days.    Host: Oh, okay.  So it's literally planned for exactly that, in worst case scenario.    Jessica Vos: It's meant to cover that worst case scenario, absolutely.    Host: Got it, okay.    Jessica Vos: So, in that event, you're getting in your suit, and you're living in your suit.  So that suit also has some unique features to it that the pumpkin suits from the space shuttle program did not have.    Host: Oh, okay.    Jessica Vos: That would allow for, you know, the collection and mitigation of human waste.    Host: Wow.    Jessica Vos: Yeah, because that's six days' worth of living, right.    Host: Um-hum, yep.  It's also going to allow you to take in some calories and some water.    Host: Okay.    Jessica Vos: So there's special food bags and food-like consistent, what am I trying to say, like material, like it's going to be, and you wouldn't normal eat it, but if you had to, it's going to be like this, I don't want to say sludge, but it's kind of like a, it's like a powdery mixture that you would--    Host: It's not like the running gel, right?  Is it kind of like that?    Jessica Vos: It would be kind of like that.    Host: Okay.    Jessica Vos: Yeah, that would allow you to take in a lot of calories.    Host: Yeah, that's what those are for, right.    Jessica Vos: In a pouch, right.    Host: Yeah, yeah.    Jessica Vos: But it's specific to interfacing with the spacesuit and being operated with gloved hands and with a vacuum on the outside environment, right.  So it's a pretty tricky thing to--    Host: Is it like a straw that goes through the helmet or something and then you squeeze it through?    Jessica Vos: Basically that's what you would see.    Host: Oh, okay, yeah.    Jessica Vos: Yes, yeah.    Host: Oh, yeah, that's how I'm imagining.  I'm sure it's more complicated.    Jessica Vos: Right, right.  So there's a whole team of engineers that is working on putting that system together to make sure that the crew won't be starving for that 144 hours that they will.  But you can't pop the visor, you can't, you know, the whole, the whole interior of the spacecraft at that point is a vacuum.    Host: Right.    Jessica Vos: So--    Host: So you have to survive in the suit, and that suit has to support you for six days.    Jessica Vos: Yep.    Host: Whoa.    Jessica Vos: Yeah.    Host: That's cool.  I actually think, is it, is it Cody Kelly?    Jessica Vos: Yeah.    Host: Jessica Vos: Is that the guy?    Jessica Vos: Yeah.    Host: Okay, yeah, I got his name about crew survival and stuff, so we're really going to have to bring him on the podcast.    Jessica Vos: Oh, absolutely.  That would be a-- he's a fun person, and he does all the fun stuff so--    Host: Awesome.  That would be cool.  Yeah, so the suits themselves are designed, but then, you know, they go into a tiny little locker, and then, you know, hands off for that.    Jessica Vos: In fact, the seats do as well.    Host: Oh, the seats go in lockers?    Jessica Vos: Yeah.  The whole cabin configuration just kind of changes from okay we're in flight mode to now were in just coast mode, right.    Host: Whoa.    Jessica Vos: And just live and do science experiments.    Host: Do the screens stay?    Jessica Vos: Yes.    Host: The screens stay, the chairs go, the suits go, and it opens up this whole thing.    Jessica Vos: Yep.    Host: Oh, that's so cool.  You know what, I did skip over, because you did briefly mention it, and then I just sort of skipped over it, but beds, you know, like sleeping.  It sounds like it's just going to be a sleeping bag strapped to a wall.    Jessica Vos: Right, yeah.  I was going to say, not so much with the bed.  There's no mattress, no, but there's also no gravity, so it's kind of cool, and this is, it's very similar to on space station.    Host: Right.    Jessica Vos: They find themselves rather comfortable once, you know, they adjust, that whole, you know, the way you feel when you first enter microgravity and the first couple of days can be a little, a little strange on the body.    Host: Yeah.    Jessica Vos: But you do get used to it fairly quickly.  It only takes a couple of days, but once you're there, it's really comfortable, and what they do is they have a blanket.  It's just thin though.  It's not like a big poufy sleeping bag or anything like that.  It's just thin because the temperature inside the cabin is, you know, that very comfortable kind of 72 to 75 degrees, and it's got various straps in places so that where you want to feel that snuggy feeling, right, you can, do it tight, but for the most part, they actually like to just kind of leave it a little bit loose, and you'll see them, they kind of sleep like zombies.    Host: Right.    Jessica Vos: Like they have their arms out in front of them, and they're just kind of hanging and they're floating, and it's funny because the station sleeping, quote unquote, sleeping bags are, they've got all of these straps and this and that to make sure your head doesn't go bobbling around and so you can hook yourself to the wall and you can get it super tight if you want.  And it just seems like none of that gets used.  Just floating there feels nice.    Host: Yeah.    Jessica Vos: You know, you can imagine, if you just kind of let your body just float in a pool.    Host: Oh, yeah, that's a good feeling, that's a good feeling.    Jessica Vos: You know, yeah.  So they're just like, all right, I'm going to sleep now.  Just lean back and let their arms float and--    Host: Yeah.    Jessica Vos: You know, but they do, they do, I think, at least give themselves a little bit of a restraint so that they know they're not going to end up in somebody else's space overnight or into a different module entirely.    Host: That's true.  You don't want to play like space bumper cars in the middle of the night, just kind of slamming into each other.  That would be weird.  Yeah, just from talking to a couple astronauts, they both said, sleeping, you know, once you get used to it, sleeping in space is probably the best sleep you'll ever get.  Because, if you think about it, right, even in a bed here on Earth, you still have gravity pushing you against that bed.  In space you have--    Jessica Vos: And it's pushing that weight of the blanket on you too, which is so comforting.    Host: Oh, that is, that is comforting, yeah.  But just nothing pressing on you, that's got to be a fantastic feeling.    Jessica Vos: Yeah.    Host: I bet you it should.    Jessica Vos: Yeah.    Host: Just out of curiosity, for the way the mission is designed, for Orion missions, would it be kind of lights out, crew go to sleep, all at the same time, or are they going to be shifting?    Jessica Vos: As far as I understand it, there's not going to be much shifting.  They're going to be on a very similar, in terms of a day night schedule and sleep schedule, it'll be fairly similar.  What they will shift is their exercise sessions and their kind of personal time sessions, but from a day-night cycle, it would be the same.    Host: Okay.  Do they have the ability to sort of switch to like night mode and maybe turn the lights off or change them to like a warmer color?    Jessica Vos: Well, so that's interesting you ask that, because lighting is a big deal in terms of, you know, the habitability of an environment, right.    Host: Definitely.    Jessica Vos: You can have some really harsh lighting and just get headaches all the time, and you'd just be really like, grrr, and it's due to the lighting.  So I believe that the systems, there are requirements now for how we design habitable environments and what kind of lighting is required, and I know that they've implemented some interesting new blue light stuff up on space station.  So, I believe that that is one of the, going to be one of the capabilities with the lighting system in Orion, is to have different basically modes of light.  I don't know how fancy they're going to get, because it's not light we've got the Lexus of space crafts here, you know.  But that is something that is, in terms of helping them stick to a cycle, a day-night cycle, the whole circadian rhythms and all of that stuff, all of that science has been done, we know it works.  And so I believe that part of, at least some of that is going to be implemented in the lighting system in Orion.    Host: Yeah.  Because I know they are doing, it's called the lighting effect study on station, and it's exactly that.  LED lights, change them to a little warmer things in your crew quarters or something, so at night you don't have this big fluorescent light in your [inaudible].    Jessica Vos: Absolutely, yeah, they use them in HERA too.    Host: Oh, oh yeah they do.  That's right.    Jessica Vos: The whole bottom floor of the lab has a completely different set of lights than the habitation floors, both with the galley and the exercise equipment and stuff and then the sleeping tents, you know, on the very top floor of HERA, so--    Host: Yeah, just actually learning some of this stuff from HERA from this light effect study, I actually put like a blue light filter on my phone and on my computer like so at night I can, you know, I can browse a little bit without having to worry about it actually affecting my sleep.    Jessica Vos: Yep.    Host: Which after learning about it, I realized, oh my gosh, that's why I'm not sleeping, because I'm screens before bed.  You can't do it.    Jessica Vos: So in terms of speaking of screens, they will have laptops.    Host: Cool.    Jessica Vos: Anywhere between two and four.  There might be a couple laptops and a couple of iPads.  All of that is still to be determined, but it is currently accounted for in terms of the mass allotment for that kind of a system.    Host: All right.    Jessica Vos: And there's some dependencies there and some reasons why we would use that stuff.  One is to get rid of a bunch of paper, right.  You can do all of your procedures and stuff from your tablet.  They do that on station all the time now.  And another, especially from the crew health perspective is that that's how they would be able to do any sort of video conferencing, right, with home.  So I say that, at the same time, the way that EM2, the EM2 vehicle is currently equipped, it's only got the S band communication technology.    Host: So only radio, no visual.    Jessica Vos: Pretty much.  You might be able to squeeze a little bit in there, pictures but probably not real-time skype-like video.    Host: Yeah, yeah.    Jessica Vos: So, but there is some potential to expand Orion's capability with optical communication, and once they would do that, then for sure they'd be using these laptops to do more, you know, videoing with their families at home.  But they absolutely will have time each day or at least every other day or something along those lines to be communicating with their families.    Host: Nice.  All right.  So that's part of their day, right.  Actually that's a good conversation to have is we know that they are, you know, they're going to be working out.  We know that they're going to be sleeping.  What's a day on Orion like on this mission.  I guess, you know, talking with family, but, you know, is that built into the mission profile?    Jessica Vos: So we are flying people that are very good pilots for a reason.  Good pilots and good scientists, right.  Okay, well I guess it's pilots, scientists, and engineers.    Host: All right.    Jessica Vos: And the reason for that is because you need people, this EM2 mission is a mission that has not been done before.  Similar things have been done in Apollo, but that spacecraft was different, and the designs and how we got the mission done was a little bit different.  So this EM2 mission is really a checkout mission, and there's a lot of dynamic phases of flight.  A lot of, you know, translunar injection burns and stuff going on.  We're co-manifesting a payload on this mission, so there is a lot to, and it's just the first time that all of this stuff is going to be used in the manner that it was meant to be used by humans, right.  EM1 will test out a lot of the structure and the systems that are just automated and controlled from the ground, so that's good, but this is when the humans will kind of, you know, be doing the ringing out of all the different things that may or may not have been known about how this design is going to work.    Host: Yeah, yeah.    Jessica Vos: So they're going to be doing a lot of, you know, checking out, a lot of system checkout and kind of on purpose, you know, kind of driving certain systems to do certain things.  They're going to be piloting and navigating that spacecraft through all the different dynamic phases of flight.  They are going to be, there probably will be some science, but I don't expect that to come until like a little bit later missions, once we've really kind of flushed out what the system can handle and what it can't, because they need to be ready just in case something just isn't working the way it was planned to, designed to for whatever reason.    Host: Right.    Jessica Vos: They will spend a little bit of time doing their meal prep and meal time, and for the most part, that's kind of the only planned relaxation time, right.  They do have their personal time of personal hygiene, which usually is right after the exercise, right, but as a crew and being able to just relax, sit back, and, you know, I wouldn't say drink your coffee, but squeeze your coffee because it's in the same kind of like, it's like a Capri Sun for coffee, the same kind of thing, with a special straw in it that keeps it from leaking out when you're not actually sucking on it.  And so from that standpoint, there is meal prep time.  The food comes in lots of different kinds of packages that take different kinds of preparation, whether that's just heating or putting water in and letting it sit out and that kind of thing.  So they'll prep the food.  They'll prepare their coffee, and then they'll sit back and eat, and they'll do that two, three times a day.  So, yeah, I think that's pretty much the extent of what they're going to be doing on EM2.   And then once we start getting, hopefully we'll understand how these systems behave and how much maintenance they all really require and be able to move into doing more science, even on the shorter Orion missions and then extend that into what the deep space gateway would have with their habitation module and their labs and stuff.    Host: All right.  I can think of like a lot of different podcast episodes just on all of this, right.  Like we could probably do one just on EM2 so people understand what that's all about.  We could probably do one just on some concepts for deep space gateway.  Like there's a lot of like, because I can definitely ask a lot of questions, but we will be here for hours.    Jessica Vos: No, let's not do that.    Host: Yeah, yeah.    Jessica Vos: It's freezing in here.  [laughter]    Host: I'm so sorry.  I should have said to bring a jacket.  We did talk briefly with Nujoud about EM1 and just the structure of that mission real brief, right.  Another thing we need to do is actually cover EM1 through and through, but that's going to be no crew.  It's going to be going translunar injection, way out past the moon, coming back super-fast to test the heat shields.  And you're right, a lot of it is structural and just understanding about the space craft.    Jessica Vos: Yep.    Host: Do you think you can give like a two-minute explanation of EM2, or is that really something we should probably save for a podcast.    Jessica Vos: Well, for the two-minute explanation, we will be launching from Kennedy Space Center on top of the SLS, and there will be a comanifested payload along with this mission.  So not only is it the first manned mission of Orion, but we will also be bringing [inaudible] payload along with us.  And the AA2, I was trying to think about the launch abort, so there will be the LAS system on top of the Orion, so in terms of the rocket sack that you'll see, you'll see SLS.  You will see Orion, but Orion will be covered by the LAS shroud, the Launch Abort Systems shroud.  But the test of that system is actually coming up before EM1, so that will be really exciting to see.    Host: Yeah.    Jessica Vos: So, once we, after we launch and we get rid of the LAS, because we didn't need it, thank goodness, right, everybody was cool, we will be going around the orbit one time in kind of a low Earth orbit, and then we'll continue on into a high Earth orbit, at which point we'll kind of separate from the first stage and let that go, and the comanifested payload in Orion will go in different directions, both going to the moon, but in different orbit trajectories, orbital trajectories.    Host: Ah, okay.    Jessica Vos: So there will be two different stages of the rocket taking these two things in two different directions, and they'll do two different translunar injections, but at that point in the mission, the Orion and the service module are heading out to the moon as are the comanifested payload, or as is the comanifested payload.  When it is on a trajectory that's going to take several, several days to get into a different orbit, it's going to be a near rectilinear halo orbit that the comanifested payload will be going into, and we will be going into just a free return trajectory around the moon.    Host: Okay, all right.  And then--    Jessica Vos: And that is expected, from the Orion perspective, it takes about, yeah, about 10 to 12 days to do that mission.    Host: Okay, 10 to 12, and that's when we're getting to the Orion can last for 21 days, but this is more of a 10 to 12 sort of deal.    Jessica Vos: Yeah.    Host: Okay.  So the comanifested payload, that stays there, right.  It doesn't come back?    Jessica Vos: It does not come back.    Host: But the people definitely do, right.    Jessica Vos: Yes, exactly.    Host: Yeah, cool.    Jessica Vos: But, yeah, the comanifested payload will be staying in that NRHO orbit around the moon, kind of that polar orbit, it looks that way.    Host: Yeah, uh-huh.    Jessica Vos: And, yeah, but we'll be coming, we'll be coming back.    Host: Cool.  All right.    Jessica Vos: So there's a whole suite of landing and recovery systems as well that allow us to retrieve the capsule once it lands and allows us to survive re-entry and then get to the capsule and recover it.    Host: Yeah, so landing and recovery, is that like a, what's included in that package?  Is that parachutes or am I--    Jessica Vos: Yeah, yeah.  Like everything that we need on that heat shield, the parachutes.  There's a system called the command module uprighting system that is, or the crew module uprighting system, excuse me, not the Apollo.  It is what will make sure that we are able to upright the vehicle should it land with its, you know, docking hatch side down in the water.  We don't want it, that's not the proper orientation, right, that would have the crew hanging in a funny position in their seats, so we want it to flip back over on it's own.  So those come out and inflate.  Those are those big orange, you know, balloon things that you see on the top of the capsule.    Host: Oh.    Jessica Vos: They used them in EFT1's.    Host: Yes, yes.  I know what you're talking about.  They're just, they look like big puffy life jackets sort of, I guess. Yeah, cool.    Jessica Vos: And there's a series of parachutes that go to that.  I think there's 11 total parachutes, when you think about all the droves and then the main, so, yeah that's a whole system in and of itself, just like the abort system protects you from anything that might go wrong on the pad.    Host: Yeah.    Jessica Vos: And then we also have a service module abort capability, which is, should anything go wrong, when you made it to orbit but now something happened that you're not able to complete the entire mission, but you don't have to lose the crew, you can just abort to an Earth orbit and then come back in, you know, intentionally, from that orbit instead of having gone all the way out to the moon and back.    Host: Ah.    Jessica Vos: So lots of orbit capability.  A lot of capability for keeping the crew alive.  In fact, you've got that launch abort capability.  You've got the system, sorry, service module abort capability.  You've got the 144-hour survival scenario.    Host: Right.    Jessica Vos: So when the crew is in their suits.    Host: Yes.    Jessica Vos: And then you also have, should you land just something off nominal, the cabin is required to provide the crew with a habitable environment for up to 24 hours.  So that would be a not very fun 24 hours.  I can tell you right now.  It's going to be, you're going to feel thick just from having gone through what you went through, let alone bobbing and rocking on the ocean. Depending on where you landed, that might be kind of a warm cabin, not a whole lot of cooling available for that time.  There is ventilation.  You open up what's called a snorkel fan, and you will get airflow, but, yeah, it's going to be, but the point is, is that they're not going to, they will be able to stay alive and be kept safe on the ocean for up to 24 hours.    Host: All right.  A lot of things to think about for a worst case scenario, but it seems like you got it, you got it like covered all along the way.  You got launch abort, you have crew survival within the suits, you got this whole waving in the ocean but still able to, you know, figure it out, even if the capsule lands upside-down, flipping it up like right side up, so.    Jessica Vos: Yeah, that is basically what human spaceflight is all about.  In order to bring back, you know, that experience that they have and to be able to use that knowledge and expertise during the mission, you got to keep them alive, and you got to keep them performing well.    Host: Yeah.    Jessica Vos: So, all of that goes into, you know, making sure that we, those are national assets at that point, right.  All of our astronauts that go and get all this knowledge.    Host: The human and the human space flight is definitely the most important [inaudible].  For sure.  Awesome.  Well, Jessica, thank you so much for coming on the podcast.  That was an awesome description of, I felt like I was there.  I felt like I was living in Orion.  I felt like I was slurping on those things through the suit.  I didn't want to, but I felt it.  But, yeah, no, that was really, that was really awesome.  We're definitely, and I thought of so many different more podcast episodes that we can do, just covering all of these different things, because this was just like a high level like, you know, even just, you know, going through the intricate details of living on Orion, there's still so much more to talk about, so definitely looking forward to another podcast.  Thanks so much for coming on.  Maybe one more time, we'll probably have to have you another time.    Jessica Vos: All right, thank you so much.    Host: Yeah, cool.     [ Music ]  Host:  Hey, thanks for sticking around.  So today we talked with Jessica Vos about living in Orion and kind of the space of how it's all laid out, and there's a lot more that we could have talked about with Orion as I mentioned at the end of the podcast.  If you want to know more right now and just can't wait for another episode of Houston We Have a Podcast, go to NASA.gov/Orion.  I would say there's definitely some cool stuff to come in Houston We Have a Podcast, but if you want to know right now, just go to that website.  Or on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram, it's @NASAOrion, that's on Facebook.  Twitter is @NASA_Orion, and then on Instagram @exploreNASA is like Orion and space launch system all of that kind of combined.   If you have a question specifically about Orion, use the hashtag askNASA on any one of those platforms, and ask that question there, or you can submit and idea to the podcast.  Just make sure to mention it's for Houston We Have a Podcast.  This podcast was recorded on November 16, 2017.  Thanks to Alex Perryman, Rachel Kraft, and Laura Rochon.  And thanks again to Ms. Jessica Vos for coming on the show.  We'll be back next week."

                        "description": "Dan Huot (Host): Houston, We Have a Podcast.  Welcome to the official podcast of the NASA Johnson Space Center.  This is Episode 36: Teacher on Board.  I'm Dan Huot, and I will be your host today.  If you're new to the show, we bring in NASA experts, the scientists, the engineers, and astronauts all to tell you everything NASA.  So today we're talking with Ricky Arnold.  He's a US astronaut, and he's about to launch to the International Space Station in March for his second space flight and first his ride up in a Russian Soyuz.  We talked about his education, how he started out as an accountant and then went to marine sciences, went on to a teacher, and eventually became an astronaut.  He flew on the Shuttle, and now he's about to fly on the International Space Station.  So with no further delay, let's go light speed and jump right ahead to our talk with Ricky Arnold.  Enjoy.     [ Music ]    Host: So Ricky Arnold, teacher, astronaut, world traveler, and now most importantly, Houston, We Have a Podcast guest.  Ricky, thanks so much for joining me this morning.  How are you doing?  How's training going?  You getting ready to go to space?    Ricky Arnold: Oh, yeah.  Thanks for having me.  It's great to be here.  I'm getting close.  I only -- this is my -- I'm finishing up my US training this week.  I've got a couple of weeks off to kind of take care of things here, around the office, and at home.  I head over to Russia in early February.  And we do all of our final training for the Soyuz, for our launch vehicle to get us to the Space Station and back, take our final exams, and then head off to Baikonur and launch in March.    Host: Big test day coming up.    Ricky Arnold: We have our finals coming up.  So -- you're never through with final exams.    Host: Yeah.  No matter what you think, kids, the test will always come back around.  So I notice you're already doing stuff for science right now.  They already have you giving sample and all kinds of things.    Ricky Arnold: Oh, yeah.    Host: This isn't just a six-month stint you guys sign up for, is it?    Ricky Arnold: No, no.  In addition to the training, you are a test subject.  So one of the big things we're trying to learn on the International Space Station is how does a human body change in outer space?  And if those changes are for the worse, what are some countermeasures we can use to help protect astronauts?  So when we go off into deep space for really long stays, how can we protect people who are going to go execute those missions?  So I've started as a test subject last year.  And I've been providing stuff to our doctors in the clinic and will continue to do that on the International Space Station, send it home.  And then when I land, the journey continues in terms of being a test subject.  I was telling you, I can come back to NASA for the rest of my life once a year for a physical just so the doctors can keep tabs on what has happened after spending time in outer space.    Host: That's a long project.    Ricky Arnold: It's a long project.    Host: That's a long project.  All right.  Well, I want to kind of dive into how Ricky Arnold became an astronaut.  Because you have a pretty unique journey for somebody in the astronaut corps.  And there's one thing I wanted to jump on right off the because --    Ricky Arnold: It is atypical.     Host: I was a business major in school.  And I see you had a bachelor's degree in accounting.    Ricky Arnold: That is true.    Host: How did that come to pass and how the heck did they let a business major into the astronaut corps?    Ricky Arnold: I went to off to college when I was 17 years old.  I had no idea what I wanted to do.  I was out of town.  The week you went up and got all the freshman counseling and orientation.  So I literally arrived on campus with classes starting in three days and signed up for no classes.  I found out where I was living, and I met with a counselor.  And he said, \"Well, what are you good at?\"  And meanwhile he's looking at the roster of classes to see what's even available.  Because most of the stuff's already been filled up.  And then he said, \"Are you good at numbers?\"  I'm good at numbers.  Okay, good, Accounting 101's opened up.  Oh, okay.  So I ended up taking an accounting class.  And I've always been okay with numbers.  And still wasn't really sure exactly what I wanted to do, so I took Accounting II.  Ended up my sophomore year taking the hardest part of accounting, which is the intermediate accounting, which is kind of where people decide to drop out of accounting because it's very, very complicated classes.   And I got through that.  And at that point, I had signed up and taken a geology class as an elective.  And it was a geology class and really enjoyed it.  And I had an interest in science from when I was much younger.  And so then I took Biology 101.  And these were just as my electives while I was still getting my accounting degree.  And I took biology -- the second, Biology II.  I ended up with a biology minor to go along with my bachelor's degree in accounting.    Host: I bet you were a rare breed.    Ricky Arnold: I was.  People, on the roster, when I would show up for these advanced-level biology classes, the teachers, they always had the majors listed there.  They said, \"Hey, Arnold, are you in the right class?\"  Said, \"Yeah, yeah, I'm just taking this for fun.  I'm taking this morphology of the halophytes just for fun.\"    Host: Oh, that sounds like a blast.    Ricky Arnold: And much like many students who went off to school, you know, I didn't have unlimited resources for college.  So I needed to graduate with a degree.  But by the end of my sophomore year, beginning of my junior I already knew I really wasn't going to make it as an accountant.  I had other things I wanted to do.  But I went ahead and got my degree and then continued taking electives in community college while working to get into graduate school at the University of Maryland in marine sciences.    Host: And so you graduated with the BS in accounting, and then you just pivoted -- because it sounds like you found something --    Ricky Arnold: I did.    Host: -- that you were interested in.    Ricky Arnold: Right.  But I just couldn't stay at college forever.  So I went to work, I went to community colleges, took chemistry, physics, calculus, all the things I needed to do to get into graduate school to pursue an advanced degree in the sciences.    Host: And so where did you go to grad school?  What was that degree?    Ricky Arnold: Went to University of Maryland.  And they have a marine and estuarine environmental science program.  Because we are right -- you know, I grew up right by the Chesapeake Bay.    Host: I grew up in Delaware.    Ricky Arnold: Oh, so you know exactly.  So you can't limit yourself to oceanography in Maryland because there's too many different types of bodies of water.  So they cover all their bases -- marine and estuarine.  And it was a research-based program.  I worked over at the Horn Point Environmental Lab on my project and actually did some -- I ended up doing some sediment geochemistry of the Severn River right near Annapolis.  So we're a subtributary of the Severn River.  So yeah, it wasn't a typical journey.    Host: Well, so you got the biology.    Ricky Arnold: And then how did you end up teaching?    Host: Well, yeah.  And so did you -- was teaching ever kind of in your mind at that point when you were going through school?  Because, again, we're hopping around.     [ Multiple Speakers ]    Ricky Arnold: It's not like a lot of people I work with who knew they wanted to fly airplanes and go to space when they were three years old -- that just wasn't me.  When I got out of school, I had a temporary job down in DC.  And this was a time where Christa McAuliffe was, you know, announced as being one of the members of the Challenger mission.  And I remember thinking distinctly like, \"Wow, that's pretty impressive that NASA recognizes the kind of people we have working in our nation's public schools.\"    Host: Oh, yeah.    Ricky Arnold: And but it really wasn't -- that certainly probably played a role in formulating an opinion of being an educator.  But one of the jobs I was working while I was taking classes at community college, I got a job at the United States Naval Academy working in the oceanography department.  And I was just taking care of their scientific equipment.  I was doing the maintenance for their equipment.  I was going out on the yard patrol vessels where you're doing projects and I was deploying the equipment for professors and students.  And I also got to work with some of the midshipmen there.  And that's really what set the bit.  Okay, you know what?  I think this is something I really want to do.  So my plan at that point -- finally a light bulb went off a couple years after getting out of college.    Host: I'll be a teacher.    Ricky Arnold: I'm going to be a teacher.  And I have all my prerequisites to get into graduate school.  So I'm going to go get my teaching certificate, do my student teaching.  And then almost as soon as I started teaching, I took job in Charles County, Maryland.  And my second semester teaching there, the second half of the year, I started taking classes at the University of Maryland in their graduate program and then enrolled the following fall.  So it was busy.  I was a first-year teacher starting my second year of teaching, going to graduate school at night in the sciences.  And it was pretty busy.  But I knew what I wanted to do at that point.  So I was doing a job I loved.  And my evenings were spent in science and my weekends.  So it was all good.    Host: What did you start off teaching?    Ricky Arnold: I started off teaching middle school science.    Host: Okay.    Ricky Arnold: Yeah.    Host: And so what grades -- because --    Ricky Arnold: Seventh grade to start off with.  And I think I had two eighth grade classes as well.    Host: But you went on to teach high school, right?    Ricky Arnold: I did.    Host: Did you have a favorite grade to teach?    Ricky Arnold: Well, I -- yes, I liked teaching high school, some of the advance college preparatory classes just for the material and the learning.  But my favorite class to teach -- which is my background's really in biology.    Host: Yeah.    Ricky Arnold: I taught an eighth grade physical science class, which was a combination of introductory physics and chemistry.  And I just really enjoyed that a lot because there's so many foundational principles there.  If you can teach a kid to read a periodic table -- not memorize it, which is what I was taught to do -- but to actually read it and --     [ Multiple Speakers ]  Yeah, the material.  All you need to know about chemistry's right here and how atoms work together.  So I just found it was just the right amount of material to kind of spark a kid's interest in that field and set them on a trajectory where if they showed up in a chemistry class in high school or in college that they would have the tools to be successful.    Host: So I mean, I could trace back to a teacher very vividly who kind of set me on my on path.  Do you kind of wonder if you were able to?  Because, I mean, now you're an astronaut and it's a very visible job.  But like you said, it was pretty incredible for NASA to recognize the people who are doing this stuff in public school.    Ricky Arnold: Right.    Host: Did you ever think about that, you know, you're setting these kids hopefully up for a life in the sciences or math or anything like that?    Ricky Arnold: I hope so.  I mean, you know, there are kids when they walk into your classroom, you know they're going to be remarkable things.  And if I played -- you know, it's possible I played a small part in it.  But it's unlikely.  There are kids who come who just -- you know they're going to go off and do amazing things.  But that's only a handful, right?  Everyone else, I think, is more like I was.  And I wasn't really all that certain.  So.    Host: Just trying to find your way still?    Ricky Arnold: Yeah, yeah.  So just to present options and let them know there are exciting career choices out there.  I still keep in touch with a few former students.  And like I said, some have gone on to do amazing things.  And but, you know, I don't know that -- maybe I played a small part.  But, you know, there's a reason you go to school for 12 years before going to college.  It's you get different teachers, different experiences, different backgrounds.  And I think that all shapes the whole.    Host: All right.  So you're busting in Maryland, you're going to school, you're teaching; how the heck did you end up in Morocco?  How did that happen?    Ricky Arnold: Yeah, I love to read when I was a -- I still love to read.  And I'm kind of a victim of my love of reading.  Because I like reading about different places, and different cultures, different things, different ideas.  And I had been teaching for four years in Maryland.  I had just finished graduate school and graduated.  And I picked up a Washington Post on a Sunday morning and there was an advertisement in the classified section, which I hardly ever looked at but this Sunday I happened to.  And it said -- the headline was \"Are you interested in teaching overseas?\"  I was like, \"I'm interested in going overseas.  I hadn't really considered teaching there as a means to get there.\"  So I called the number and went to this presentation.  It so happens the gentleman who was putting this thing on had been a headmaster at a school in Tangier, Morocco.  So he started off telling the story about, you know, living in exotic Morocco, his experience.   And I was like, \"Oh, wow.  This is something that\" --    Host: Sign me up.    Ricky Arnold: Really, sign me.  How do I do that?  Well, it doesn't quite unfold like that.  You go to these interview fairs.  We actually went into a big room and they had the jobs posted on the walls from different locations all around the world.  So you could be going to -- there's the international school of Tanzania.  We have these openings.  There's the international school of you name it.  And I ended up getting hired as a biology -- high school biology and middle school teacher and science teacher in Casablanca, Morocco.    Host: Wow.    Ricky Arnold: And so [Laughs] a year later after going to that thing, I was stepping off a plane in Casablanca and making my way to my new apartment in North Africa.    Host: I mean, that had to be -- had you ever traveled outside the country before that?    Ricky Arnold: You know, my wife and I were both teachers.  And we were newly married, too, when we moved there.  No, I'd been to --    Host: Did you at least leave Maryland?    Ricky Arnold: I'd left Maryland.  I'd been to Ecuador because a gentleman who worked in Charles County would put together these trips in the summer, like, professional development programs.  And one of them was down to the Galapagos.  So I'd been down there.  I'd been probably to Canada and maybe to Mexico but not really.    Host: Not something just totally outside your element?    Ricky Arnold: Not -- not -- yeah.    Host: I mean, what was it like to make that move?    Ricky Arnold: I don't know, I just enjoyed the community that we got to know.  I enjoyed the diversity of ideas with the students that you taught.  We had kids from all over the world, the different languages and the opportunity to try to learn some languages.  It was challenging, but I think it was a very, very rewarding part of my life.    Host: But that was just stop number one.    Ricky Arnold: Yeah.    Host: Where else did you teach?    Ricky Arnold: Yeah, we lived in Casablanca for three years.  And my daughter was born when we were living there.  My oldest daughter.  We then moved to Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, and my youngest daughter was born there.  And we lived there for five years.  And then I think we had enough -- we had the Mediterranean climate, we had the desert -- and we ended up going to the jungles of Indonesia, teaching at a small school in [inaudible] or West Papua, Indonesia.  So on the island of New Guinea.  And then two years there.  And then finally a year in Bucharest, Romania.  And from there I was hired to come to NASA.    Host: And so everything we do now with the Space Station is international -- it's right there in the name.  Did your experience, you know, kind of being a little bit of a globetrotter there for a little while, did that play into your role as an astronaut now?  Do you look back and say, \"I'm really glad I did that because none of this seems so daunting\"?    Ricky Arnold: I'm glad I did it for myself just because of the opportunity for learning.  But I naively -- when I came here for my interview, I really had no false expectations about getting a job as an astronaut.  I mean, when I applied, I thought, \"Hey, this is going to be a really, really awesome rejection letter to hang in my office.\"    Host: This will be a good story [Laughs].    Ricky Arnold: Yeah, this will be a good story.  And then when I got the interview and I came in here, I was like, well -- I mean, I really had no expectations.  But then I thought -- we have this one-hour -- the interview process itself is a week.  Most of it is medical.  There's all kind of aptitude tests and those kind of things, along with some tours.  But you have a one-hour interview with a fair number of highly-experienced astronauts and some other folks with the agency.  And it's like, \"Well, when I get to that interview, surely they're going to ask me about my international experience.\"  And so I thought that might be kind of a good thing to be able to talk about.    Host: Yeah.    Ricky Arnold: And it turns out in between when I got out of school and was working those jobs to get into graduate school, I had worked on a sail training vessel for not quite a half-year.  We sailed all over the Atlantic.  And I was an assistant science on board this vessel.  It was like, you know, four months, five months.  I figured that's hardly even worth mentioning on a resume.  That was the only thing the interview committee asked me about.  And now it makes sense.  I was deploying scientific equipment in an extreme environment, you know, late at night, you know, early in the morning.  There was always an element of risk involved with the job.  You were living on a small ship with 30-some other people and you were part of the crew.  So -- but I do think -- getting back to your question, I mean, at least having some experience overseas kind of prepared me for the travel back and forth to Russia and the amount of time we spent there and in Germany and in Japan as well.    Host: Wow.  Well, so now you're getting ready to fly.  This will be your second time.    Ricky Arnold: Right.    Host: You've been to the Space Station once?    Ricky Arnold: Right.    Host: But that was short.    Ricky Arnold: It was.    Host: It's going to be a whole new ballgame.    Ricky Arnold: Sure is.    Host: Are you really excited about this?  Are you excited?  Because we always hear from astronauts when they did the short Shuttle missions, it was like you're just getting a little taste of it and you never really feel like you're there.  You can't soak it in.  Are you really look forward to kind of stretching your legs and hanging out in microgravity for six months?    Ricky Arnold: Well, I am.  I mean, six months is a long time.  And so that's going to be a completely different mind shift from a very short duration mission where you just got to go, go, go, go, go, go, and then sleep when you get home.  You just can't do that for six months.    Host: No.    Ricky Arnold: However, you know, it was really exciting part of my career to be able to go help finish the construction of the International Space Station.  After we left, we were able to go from three to six crew, start doing a lot more of the science.  And, of course, we're just a small part in the chain.  But we provided the power to make all that happen.  And that was really exciting.  But now I get to go kind of live and work there.  You know, the assembly's pretty much done.  We're just going to go up and take advantage of everyone else's hard work and then try to do a good job, you know, doing what the Space Station was intended -- why it was built.    Host: Well, I mean, last time, so you were building it.  This time you're going to be one of those scientists.  Does that almost have you more excited because of your background of always being interested in that kind of stuff?    Ricky Arnold: It does.  It's a bit intimidating, too.  When you go to the Space Station, your building part of it.  We knew after one EVA that our mission was more or less a success.  Right?  We were up there on the fifth day in space, we got the S6 truss installed.  The next day we deployed the solar arrays.  Another book checked.  And then anything after that was kind of gravy, right?  It worked, it was all good.  Here your responsibility, you know, there's a lot of people around the world who have spent their entire career trying to get a payload into space or an experiment in space and you don't want to be the link that makes -- that kind of crushes their dreams, you know?  Because you made a mistake.  And it's going to happen, right?  But you got to minimize it and, you know, just go up and do the best job you can.    Host: And as a former teacher, can I call you a former teacher?    Ricky Arnold: Sure.    Host: Or do you still consider yourself a teacher?    Ricky Arnold: Kind of still.    Host: Are you going to go back to teaching?    Ricky Arnold: Maybe.  Maybe.  I've thought about it.  I'm right now at the halfway point.  I've been an astronaut as long as I've been a teacher.  But I still kind of call myself a teacher.    Host: Well, astroteacher Arnold.    Ricky Arnold: Yeah [Laughs].    Host: So you're not going to just be doing the science, you're going to be bringing the Station into classrooms down here on earth as part of the Year of Education on Station.    Ricky Arnold: Right.    Host: I mean, talk a little bit about what your role is going to be.  You're not the only one doing that?    Ricky Arnold: No, no.  And, you know, we've used the ISS as an education platform in the past, certainly.  But by sheer coincidence, we ended up with two additional slots on the International Space Station, which means there will be one more American there for an entire year.  And those two Americans both happen to be classroom teachers -- Joe Acaba, who's up there now, and me, who will launch in March.  So we have people who have that background for a continuous year.  And we have more crew time available to pursue education pursuits.  So we won't be the only ones doing the -- providing the educational outreach.  Certainly our crew mates will be part of it.  But it's because we're there.  It's a nice story of, \"Hey, we've got teachers in space for a year.\"  And we're certainly going to be highly involved in what's going on.  But our crew mates -- it's going to be a shared effort.  And I'm really excited about continuing to highlight the International Space Station as a platform for education.    Host: Is there any project in particular you're excited about that you guys are going to be doing, you know, either really soon or down the road while you're up there?    Ricky Arnold: Well, absolutely.  The thing that I'm most excited about is I think I mentioned earlier about the Challenger mission?    Host: Mm-hmm.    Ricky Arnold: Did I mention that earlier?    Host: Yeah, you did.    Ricky Arnold: I thought so.    Host: You said you were watching it on TV.    Ricky Arnold: I was watching it, exactly, exactly.    Host: That kind of planted a little seed.    Ricky Arnold: Planted a seed, thank you.  And, you know, I've kind of always wondered -- it was just such an amazing thing that NASA was trying to offer to the education community.  And I kind of always wonder what became of that?  What became of those lessons after that sacrifice?  And there's been amazing things done.  There's the Challenger Center have started up in carrying that mission forward.  The Onizuka Foundation.  I'm going to leave people out, but there's been families and concerned people who surrounded that mission who went on and did some really good things in education.  But I always kind of wondered what happened to the things Christa was going to do on orbit?  And so Joe and I are -- and we're going to announce it here shortly -- but Joe and I are going to have the opportunity to conduct some of the lesson plans that Christa McAuliffe was going to do while she was on Challenger back in 1986.    Host: All right.  And so --    Ricky Arnold: Which I think is really cool.    Host: No, I mean, that's -- that's incredible.  And it does kind of bring it full circle as NASA -- we started the educator focus back then, we're doing it now.  So I mean, you got to just be excited to get up there.    Ricky Arnold: Yeah.  And hopefully inspire other teachers out there to pursue degrees in -- you know, advanced degrees in science -- you know, direct in science.  Not science education.  But as a scientist and consider, you know, maybe coming to NASA at some point and continue the mission.  Joe and I are the only two left.  Barb Morgan left a few years ago.  Dotty Metcalf-Lindenburger left shortly after Barb.  And then it's just Joe and I are the only two left.  So we got to hand off the baton to someone.    Host: No pressure.    Ricky Arnold: No, no pressure at all.    Host: So aside from all that, anything you're just really excited about getting up there to do?  Any science you've seen going on recently; you really want to do some space walks; anything that's --    Ricky Arnold: Oh, well, you know --    Host: -- on the Ricky Arnold bucket list for Space Station?    Ricky Arnold: Doing another spacewalk would be -- would be awesome.  The science we're doing up there, I -- really excited to be a part that.  Just because we're really working hard to improve life here on earth.  But from a purely selfish standpoint, I'm just look forward to having some time to look out the window.  The look -- I'll never forget my first look at earth from space.  And that image is kind of embedded in my mind and I think always will be.  But on the Shuttle we just didn't have a lot of time for just looking out the window and admiring Earth.  You get a real sense for this is all we got right now.  The planet's beautiful, we're all in it together, and there's a lot of nothing that surrounds us.  And so just appreciate the earth from low-earth orbit and maybe encourage people to take better care of it.  It's the only thing we got right now.    Host: All right.  Well, I know I got to let you go back and do astronaut stuff.    Ricky Arnold: Yeah, I know.    Host: One final question.    Ricky Arnold: Sure.    Host: You've been an astronaut now as long as you've been a teacher, and you said, you know, maybe you'll go back and teach.  What would you go teach?  Would you go back and do eighth grade science?  What would you go do, you think?    Ricky Arnold: That's a good question.  I think I would probably go back to middle school, seventh or eighth grade.  I just enjoy work working that age group.  You know, they're still figuring things out, they're still open to ideas.  They're still by and large enthusiastic about learning.  I just -- there's something to me that -- I didn't intentionally become a middle school teacher, but it was something that I really, really enjoyed.  And I just found it a very rewarding job.  And so will I consider it?  I still got a little bit more time here at NASA and some more things I want to accomplish here.  But, you know, who knows?    Host: Yeah.  Well, I mean, being a teacher from space has got to look good on the resume.  You'll be competitive.  You'll be competitive for the job.    Ricky Arnold: If I can get a job, yeah, exactly.    Host: All right.  Well, again, Ricky Arnold, soon to be International Space Station resident on board coming up in March.  Thanks for joining me today, man.    Ricky Arnold: My pleasure.

                        "description": "Gary Jordan (Host): Houston, we have a podcast. Welcome to the official podcast of the NASA Johnson Space Center, Episode 3, Landing from Space. I'm Gary Jordan, and I'll be your host today. So on this podcast, we bring in the experts -- NASA scientists, engineers, astronauts, pretty much all the folks that have the coolest information, the stuff you really want to know -- right on the show to tell you about everything NASA, everything from extraterrestrial dirt to the unknown parts of the universe. So today, we're talking landing from space with Dr. John Charles. He's the chief scientist for the NASA Human Research Program here at the NASA Johnson Space Center in Houston, Texas, and we talked about the more human side of space -- specifically, what happens to the human body in the microgravity environment and what that means for adjusting to life back on Earth, even on other planets, like Mars. I also had the chance to catch NASA Astronaut Shane Kimbrough just two days after landing from a 173-day mission aboard the International Space Station, and he gave a firsthand experience of what it feels like to adjust back to Earth's environment after living in space for that long. So with no further delay, let's go light speed and jump right ahead to our talk with Dr. John Charles and then NASA Astronaut Shane Kimbrough. Enjoy.  [ Music ]  Host: All right. Dr. Charles, welcome. Is it, should I say Dr. Charles or John?  John Charles: Call me John.  Host: John, okay. [laughs] All right. Well, John, thanks for coming on the show. We always seem to end up in the same circles first with the landing on Mars video and with speaking presentations, and, you know, you were the first person I thought of when we had this topic. But what's cool about this one is for this particular podcast, I actually got a chance to talk to Shane Kimbrough two days after he landed, which was awesome. I mean, he was really tired, but it was pretty cool to talk to him. Not to say that you're not a special guest, but--  John Charles: I'll try not to be as tired as you are.  [ Laughs ]  Host: Well, we're doing this I guess after lunchtime, so I can understand.  John Charles: Yeah, that's possible. Yeah.  Host: It is. But what's cool is that he was just getting adjusted to Earth. It was perspective, of such a unique perspective. He just came down, and he was still getting adjusted, and that takes weeks, right? That takes--  John Charles: Yes, it may take -- well, some folks say it takes as long to respond to or adjust back to Earth as it did in flight. So there is going to be ongoing adjustments, especially in the areas of, say, the bone loss, that will take months, and months, and months before they even come back to what they were approximately before flight.  Host: Yeah. I mean, even some astronauts say they have, they still have dreams about floating. I mean, even floating and--  John Charles: Yeah.  Host: They kind of, I guess their body just doesn't know where they are.  John Charles: That, it's certainly, it is certainly a monumental experience, and I cannot imagine ever getting tired of it or used to it. I understand Peggy Whitson was excited to get the mission extension of three more months.  Host: Right.  John Charles: And she said she was actually interested in going back again. So I think once you've experienced the wonders of weightlessness, and the awesome view out the window, and all the other parts of going on a spaceflight these days, it's not something you ever get used to, and it probably colors your dreams for many, many years to come.  Host: That's beautifully put way.  John Charles: Thank you.  Host: A beautiful way of saying it. But that's what I guess, you know, for, at least for Shane Kimbrough is kind of I guess happy to be home. You know, when we were interviewing him, his wife was not too far away. So he was, you know, I'm sure he's happy to see his family.  John Charles: Sure.  Host: But I was thinking, you know, why don't we start off with that conversation with Shane Kimbrough? Because he does talk about a lot of the human aspects, and he just says, you know, I'm dizzy and this is how I'm feeling. So I thought it would be cool if we kind of elaborated on that a little bit after. But first, let's start with Shane Kimbrough's interview. We do have to go back in time, so producer Alex, let's cue the wormhole sound effect thingy.  [ Music ]  Host: So if you need to take a breather, you know, let me know because it's just like talking, and then talking--  Shane Kimbrough: No, no. It's—  Host: And then talking, and then talking.  Shane Kimbrough: Good. [laughs] Let's knock it out.  Host: Oh, man. So, wow. Okay, I know it's been a busy couple of days for you, but, you know, thanks for taking the time to actually set, you know, ten minutes aside to have this conversation. You just landed two days ago. That's pretty crazy. [laughs] But since we only do have, like, a short period of time, I thought we'd start, and if you can just kind of take us through the journey of starting at when you were saying your final goodbyes to Peggy, and to Thomas, and Oleg, and then you just closed the hatch, and then that journey all the way to where you, bam, smacked the ground.  Shane Kimbrough: All right. Yeah, we were, you know, it was an anticipated moment when we were going to say goodbyes. We'd kind of been sitting around for about an hour waiting on the time to, when Sergey, the Soyuz commander, came and said, \"It's time to go.\" So we did say our goodbyes. We gave hugs to all the other crew members we were leaving, like you said -- Peggy, and Thomas, and Oleg. We spent about four-and-a-half months together with them, so we spent a lot of time together, so we got to be really good friends and crewmates. So it was great with them, but it was, you know, we were heading home, and so we had to say our goodbyes, quickly shut the hatch right after we say goodbyes, and then we started preparing our vehicle with leak checks and everything, trying to make sure we were leak tight before we departed from the Space Station.  Host: So a lot of, like, a lot of right to the procedures, right. Not a lot of reflection time.  Shane Kimbrough: Absolutely.  Host: Just right into it.  Shane Kimbrough: We didn't have any time to mess around [laughs] because you, we do a leak check, then we get in our space suits, and then we get in the descent module, close the hatch to the other module, and then we depart pretty quickly. So all had to happen, you know, by the procedure. If we had any hiccup in that, then we wouldn't have been leaving that day. So it was pretty pressure packed trying to get to the undocking time. And so we undock, and then we actually, after you undock, you have about an hour and a half, which is an entire revolution around the Earth, to really not do much. So we took a little nap [laughs] because we were--  Host: Well deserved.  Shane Kimbrough: Really tired. I mean, they had us on a crazy sleep shift on the last day. And so we were pretty worn out. So we took a little nap and then got ready after that for the deorbit burn, which is a pretty big emotional event when the big engine fires off--  Host: Yeah.  Shane Kimbrough: And puts you on a trajectory to enter the Earth's atmosphere at the correct angle so that you actually make the landing site and make sure the vehicle's pointed in the right direction so you don't burn up when you're coming through the atmosphere. So that's obviously a plus.  Host: So you didn't really feel the deorbit burn, right? You mainly felt the reentry? Is that what--  Shane Kimbrough: You do feel the deorbit burn--  Host: Oh.  Shane Kimbrough: Because the engine kicks in and it's, you know, it's kind of like a kick in the pants, and you're thrown back in your seat.  Host: Oh, wow.  Shane Kimbrough: And it, you know, lasts I think about a couple minutes. So, you know, it's a sustained kind of pulse, and--  Host: You feel it that whole time, right?  Shane Kimbrough: Yeah, you're feeling it. I mean, initially, you feel it a little more, and then you get used to it.  Host: Right, right.  Shane Kimbrough: And so then you're kind of getting ready to come back through the atmosphere, then separation of our descent module in the [inaudible], the habitation compartment happens. That's kind of like just an explosion, right. [laughs] So you feel it. You hear it. You see things flying by the windows from the other module that just came apart. So that's pretty interesting.  Host: Yeah, not a boring ride.  Shane Kimbrough: No, [laughs] not a boring ride. And then, we're kind of getting ready for the next big event. There's always, I mean, four or five big events along the way. The next one was parachute opening. Of course, after you started pulling, you're feeling the effects of gravity, all right. So we were pulling and we ended up pulling them 4.3 g's I think. So we felt like 4.3 times your body weight.  Host: Wow.  Shane Kimbrough: Which, after microgravity, felt like about 20 times your body weight.  Host: Yeah.  Shane Kimbrough: And so that built up, and we kind of just felt it building. We're watching the meter go up, and, man, I was like, wow, that's a lot. And then, right after that, the parachute, you know, started coming out, and that was really an emotional event because it's really dynamic, [laughs] I guess is the best word. And it kind of throws you around really drastically four or five times, and, you know, it's completely normal. But until you go through it the first time, which is my first experience, I was like, there's no way this can be normal.  Host: Yeah. [laughs]  Shane Kimbrough: But it is, and that's the way they do it, and it's just the parachute coming out and getting set up and the risers getting in the right position. And then, once that's done and then it's kind of a peaceful ride until you crush into the ground.  Host: Yeah, yeah. [laughter] Okay, so the swinging back and forth, how would you compare that? Is it -- I'm thinking of an amusement park ride, right. It's got to be more intense than that, right?  Shane Kimbrough: It is, but, you know, I don't know if there's one out there that just really slams you to the right [laughs] and slams you to the left, and you do that five or six times, you know, in a -- you know, I can't think of one that does that, but that's what it was like. I couldn't believe it.  Shane Kimbrough: Yeah.   Host: I guess that's why they, you know, they kind of strap you into that thing real tight, right, because you're--  Shane Kimbrough: Right.  Host: Getting bounced and kicked in, like, all--  Shane Kimbrough: Exactly, yeah.  Host: Directions.  Shane Kimbrough: So as we come in, you start, the advice I got was as soon as you start feeling the g-force, start pulling on your straps as much as you can to really get you down into that seat--  Host: Yeah.  Shane Kimbrough: So that you're not just secured but, you know, getting ready for the impact of the landing as well.  Host: So is it fair to say that that landing was the hardest impact, probably?  Shane Kimbrough: Oh, yeah. [laughs] Yeah. No doubt.  Host: How did that feel?  Shane Kimbrough: it was, you know, I've heard it called like, it's like a really bad car crash, and now I can confirm that that is accurate.  Host: Wow.  Shane Kimbrough: So you hit just really hard. And in our case, we hit twice really hard, so.  Host: Oh. [laughs] And then, you roll around, right?  Shane Kimbrough: And then, we rolled some more too just for added effect, so.  Host: And then, you said, I remember you saying, because we did it in like a bunch of other events before this, but you said, like, you were in a position where you were just kind of dangling a little bit, right?  Shane Kimbrough: Yeah, so I was kind of on--  Host: You were--  Shane Kimbrough: Top looking down at the ground, but--  Host: Yeah.  Shane Kimbrough: In that case, I was hanging from my straps.  Host: Wow.  Shane Kimbrough: Really uncomfortable feeling for about five minutes, five to ten minutes until they could get there and roll the vehicle kind of to the normal position.  Host: Oh, that's it. Just five to ten minutes, and then they were there.  Shane Kimbrough: Yeah. It was very likely we had perfect weather that day. The search and rescue forces saw us the whole time. And really, right after the parachute opened, they tracked us all the way to the ground, so they were right there--  Host: Wow.  Shane Kimbrough: In about ten minutes and got us out pretty quickly.  Host: So when that door opened and they pulled you out, what was that feeling? Was it relief or was it just more of the, you know, just here's the next step kind of thing? Or, like, describe those emotions.  Shane Kimbrough: Yeah, so the hatch, they opened the hatch, the search and rescue forces. And they're familiar faces from our training in Star City, Russia. I mean, they're Russian--  Host: Yeah.  Shane Kimbrough: Folks. But it was nice to see their smiling faces. And then, I saw my flight sergeant from NASA and the Chief Astronaut Cassidy right there as well. So, you know, we were all smiles and waving. We all felt great at the time. And getting out is very challenging because it is so small, like we were talking about earlier.  Host: Right.  Shane Kimbrough: But they have to help you out. You can't get out on your own for gravity for one, and then it's just too tight and too small. You can't even really get to unstrap yourself. They have to get in there. It's that tight.  Host: Wow.  Shane Kimbrough: Like, you can't move your hands enough to unstrap most of your straps, so they get in there and help you out doing that as well as pulling you out of the vehicle.  Host: Yeah. So okay, when you first, you know, you're pulled out of the capsule. You have fresh air, familiar faces. Obviously, that's a great moment, but so now you're kind of, you're back on Earth. You can feel it, right? What's, how are you feeling -- do you feel sick? Do you feel, is it mostly happy? Is there overwhelming feelings? What's going on?  Shane Kimbrough: I think people have felt all those things you've mentioned. [laughs] I really felt great. I love smelling that fresh desert air. It was kind of like a 60-degree day in Kazakhstan. Feels beautiful. The wind was blowing. It was just awesome to have that sensation of nature again for me. And then, just seeing friendly faces and knowing I was going to get to talk to my family pretty soon after that was pretty special.  Host: Yeah, that's amazing. What was the, so what was the main thing you noticed about the way your body was adjusting to life back on Earth?  Shane Kimbrough: Well, to not move your head around is great advice, I guess. [laughs] Yeah, because that really provokes some folks to get sick, so--  Host: Okay.  Shane Kimbrough: I really try to keep my head focused straight ahead. If anybody was talking to me, I would make them come right in front of me so I didn't have to kind of, because the natural tendency is to just look at them, right, but that really gets your--  Host: Yeah.  Shane Kimbrough: Inner ear spinning up pretty well and--  Host: It must've been hard because there's a lot happening, right? People are--  Shane Kimbrough: There is.  Host: All over. Yeah. [laughs] Yeah.  Shane Kimbrough: So I heard people to my side, and I was, I just told them, \"Hey, come right in front of me so I can see you [laughter] because I'm not going to turn my head.\"  Host: Yeah, exactly. So--  Shane Kimbrough: And it seemed to pay off, so.  Host: Yeah. Well, okay, so besides feeling sick, were you weak, like are, can you move around, or what was the--  Shane Kimbrough: You can move around a little bit.  Host: Okay.  Shane Kimbrough: They were carrying us. You know, I wasn't walking anywhere at the time, and they had people that carried us to where we were sitting there for a while. And then, after that, they carried us to the medical tent. But once we got in there, then it was a bunch of testing, and walking, and with your eyes closed and open, and just crazy things. And, [laughs] you know, just trying to--  Host: You just don't get a break.  Shane Kimbrough: See where you're at. [laughter]  Host: You just don't get a break. And then, they throw you--  Shane Kimbrough: Yeah.  Host: On, what is it? To get a helicopter, and then the helicopter--  Shane Kimbrough: Yeah.  Host: To a plane.  Shane Kimbrough: Right.  Host: You're off to Houston.  Shane Kimbrough: Exactly.  Host: Did you -- I'm guessing you slept on the plane, right?  Shane Kimbrough: I did. I slept--  Host: Yeah.  Shane Kimbrough: Really well on the plane, so it was good. [laughter]  Host: I probably should've start off this -- I just realized -- but how are you feeling now?  Shane Kimbrough: I'm feeling, yeah, I'm feeling really well compared to what I thought I'd be feeling at this point. It's only two days after I landed, like you mentioned earlier, and I really feel great. I had a great workout today, which I think really made me feel better.  Host: Oh, wow. You're right back into it.  Shane Kimbrough: Yeah, so we got about a 45-day program of working out and getting you rehabilitated, back to your full strength.  Host: Okay.  Shane Kimbrough: But it should only take maybe a week or so to get there, and then from there, we'll just build on whatever strength I have.  Host: All right. All right, well, one more question, then I'll let you go. What was the first thing you ate when you got back here?  Shane Kimbrough: [laughs] A lot of people are asking me that, and [laughs] it's a really boring answer, but it was a banana--  Host: Oh.  Shane Kimbrough: Because that's something [laughs] I hadn't had in--  Host: A banana.  Shane Kimbrough: A while. I was really wanting some fruit, and--  Host: That's true. It's not, yeah.  Shane Kimbrough: I had a banana and an apple and had a bunch of those on the plane. [laughs]  Host: Okay, so once you're -- how about this? -- once you're well enough, what's the first thing you're--  Shane Kimbrough: Yeah.  Host: Going to eat?  Shane Kimbrough: I think we're going to do some Italian tonight, which I've been thinking about.  Host: Oh.  Shane Kimbrough: So that's good. And then, Mexican probably here in the next few days as well, so.  Host: All right. All right.  >> It'll be good.  Host: Definitely two good ones. Well, Shane, thank you for spending these couple minutes with me.  Shane Kimbrough: My pleasure.  Host: Thanks.  Shane Kimbrough: Thanks, Gary.  Host: Cool.  [ Music ]  Host: All right. Producer Alex, we're going to have to work on that wormhole sound effect. Come on. That was quite a ride. I mean, I was, [laughs] I honestly felt sick just listening to the way that he was going down. But there was a lot going on for every step of the way, so, I mean, first off, you know, what are those changes that he was talking about that makes him feel so, you know, so off when he lands on the ground?  John Charles: The human body goes through many changes in weightlessness and the rest of spaceflight. I'm always interested most in weightlessness. I don't like the term microgravity. I think that's unnecessarily accurate.  Host: There's a lot of synonyms, or syllables.  John Charles: It's, yeah, a lot of syllables too. [laughs] But the weightlessness has profound effects, and I like to say that it's evolutionarily unanticipated. There's nothing that has ever happened to us in our lives and in all of the lives of everybody that lived before us, all the way back to as far as you want to go, that is weightlessness. Now, even floating in water is not weightlessness because you're still subject to gravity. The parts of your body that are denser go to the bottom and the parts of your body that are lighter float to the top, and that's true even in the vestibular system. The organs of balance he was talking about. Being dizzy. Those are not weightless, even underwater. The only time they're weightless is if you fall off a cliff, and then the effect is very short lived.  Host: Right.  John Charles: You don't get a chance to enjoy it very much.  Host: Right.  John Charles: So this is a real opportunity to, for the body to experience something that it's never experienced before ever, and not surprisingly, there are changes that occur in the body, and the changes might be summarized by the concept that the body economizes its metabolic energy. It doesn't waste energy supporting metabolic processes it doesn't think it needs. And nobody, you can't tell your body, hang on to that because you're going to need it eventually. The body doesn't talk to you in that sense. The body responds -- and by this, I mean the autonomic processes, the physiological processes -- respond to the environment that they have seen recently and are seeing at the moment. So as far as the body is concerned, gravity went away and it's never coming back. And so what do I need to do to be more effective metabolically in the environment that I will see forever?  Host: It's just the body adapting to a new environment.  John Charles: It's to a new environment. And luckily, the body adapts nicely to the weightless environment--  Host: Right.  John Charles: Because it really is sort of a step down. It's less hard to do almost everything metabolically in weightlessness, and the body doesn't know that you're going back to Earth with gravity, so you have to fool the body to get back to, to get ready to go back to Earth. So you go through the changes of weightlessness, and these metabolic efficiencies I'm talking about include not maintaining bone strength. You don't need bone strength in weightlessness, and the body says, great, I'm not going to spend metabolic energy on that anymore. I'm going to dedicate it to something else.  Host: Right.  John Charles: You don't need muscle strength. You don't need cardiovascular strength so much. You don't need all of the intricate understanding of how to respond to gravity. You don't need to keep track of where all your joints are, your limbs, and all that kind of stuff.  Host: Because all of that is gone in the weightless environment.  John Charles: That's right.  Host: It's just, you don't need your bones because you're not pressed up against anything.  John Charles: You're not--  Host: You're just floating.  John Charles: You're not supporting yourself anymore.  Host: Right.  John Charles: There is a residual bone strength, a residual bone volume or density that you will probably plateau at. If you stay in space forever, you will never become like the guys were in WALL-E when they had no bones.  Host: [laughs] Yeah.  John Charles: Just the big blobs of jelly.  Host: That's right.  John Charles: That would never happen. You probably, based on other studies and clinical experience, you'd probably lose up to 40% of your bone mass eventually. That is after years, and years, and years.  Host: Wow.  John Charles: So you, I mean, even so--  Host: Is this saying that you're not working out during those years?  John Charles: Yeah, assuming you're just weightless.  Host: Assuming you're just weightless.  John Charles: Assuming you're just weightless and not working out, that's right.  Host: Okay.  John Charles: Which would be I think my preferred lifestyle. [laughs] I'd like to be weightless and not working out. But that, see, Gary, that's the answer, though, is the way we fool the body or don't fool the body. We just change the conditions is by working out. So the astronauts work out two hours a day every day, including resistive exercise, my favorite. I call that weight lifting in weightlessness.  Host: Right.  John Charles: And that's all done with hydraulics and computers. And then, or aerobic training -- exercising on treadmills, and bicycles, and maybe a rowing machine someday. And what that does is put a load on the bones, and the muscles, and the cardiovascular system, not the vestibular system, not the organs of balance, but all the other systems mimicking the absence or the effect of gravity, which is then absent in that environment.  Host: So that's, so they're doing those you said aerobic and resistive. So that's the, I guess like you said, though, in space, the weight-lifting machine--  John Charles: Right.  Host: Sort of with hydraulics--  John Charles: Right.  Host: And that simulates weight lifting. And then, you also have aerobic exercise, which is the treadmill and the bicycle.  John Charles: The bicycle.  Host: So you have to do this I believe two and a half hours every single day--  John Charles: Yeah.  Host: In order to maintain everything?  John Charles: Right. And that's a total of two plus hours a day. That includes breakdown, and setup, and changing your clothes, and all that stuff. So you do--  Host: Oh, yeah.  John Charles: You know, multiple tens of minutes at each.  Host: I see.  John Charles: And different exercises on different days. And I think one day is actually a free form. You can do whatever you want. But, you know, the other days are fairly prescribed. But what that does is put a load on the bones, and the muscles, and the cardiovascular system, and other organs as if they were doing something against gravity. It's not the same, but it's close.  Host: So that's the way that you're saying you're tricking your body--  John Charles: You're tricking your body.  Host: Into thinking that, you know, you don't need, you still need to maintain the muscles. Hold on.  John Charles: Right.  Host: Stop. You know.  John Charles: You're maintaining them for something else. You're maintaining them for exercise and not for fighting against gravity.  Host: Right.  John Charles: But it has the beneficial effect in many cases of being appropriate for gravity. And in fact, the resistive exercises that we're doing now seem to minimize the loss of bone structure that occurs in weightlessness that has been seen on previous missions. So the Advanced Resistive Exercise Device, the ARED, may well be the way that we protect bones and muscles in the future on Mars missions.  Host: Oh.  John Charles: It may be that we're able to go on really long missions without losing much calcium and without changing the structure very much of the bones. And it's not the loss of calcium per se that's the problem. It's where the calcium comes out of. The bones are developed in everybody whilst you're growing up.  Host: Right.  John Charles: You're, when you're growing up, you know, you're, first, you're born with a skeleton, and then you spend the first 18 years of your life banging yourself around, and jumping up in trees and off of hillsides, and falling, and jumping, and running, and pulling, and lifting. And all that stuff shapes your body.  Host: Yeah, and that's in childhood.  John Charles: Right, and that, [laughs] well, I saw people do it. [laughs] Like I said, see previous comment.  Host: Right, right.  John Charles: But that shapes your body and gives you the structure you need to keep doing that for the rest of your life. And then, at some point, that, those structures, those facets are completed, and you can then go and do useful things with the body that you've built up over the first 18 plus years of your life.  Host: Right.  John Charles: So when you go into weightlessness, you start eating away at that in the absence of gravity, and if you come back to the Earth, you restore some of that, but you don't restore it the way it was originally. You restore it to the way it needs to be now, which means you don't go back inside the bones and reestablish the framework, the structure. And the bones actually have structure inside of them. The outside is called the cortex, and it's a thick layer. And then, on the inside are the trabeculae, and the trabeculae are like a framework. Think of a lattice work inside of your bones. And those, that lattice work is genetically engineered by you as you grow up to respond to the forces you're putting on bones. So it puts down calcium where the forces are the greatest and it doesn't put down calcium where the forces are not the greatest. But that's the structure you take with you for the remainder of your active life, unless you go into weightlessness. In which case, that obviously gets eroded gradually but persistently over the time in weightlessness. So your bones actually do lose calcium, do lose mass, bone mass, and you lose strength of the bones. Not, so far, not enough to cause you to fracture when you come back to the ground. There have been a couple of astronauts who have fractured bones in the post-flight period, and we have analyzed those, and they would've fractured their bones if they had never flown in space. They just caused an impact that broke bones, and that's just what happens.  Host: They were trying to run up and down trees like their childhood days, right?  John Charles: Well, they, yeah, nothing quite so [laughs] glamorous. One guy fell off of a stage after a public affairs presentation. He just--  Host: Oh no.  John Charles: He didn't fall off. He tripped because there was something on the edge of the stage, so--  Host: Oh.  John Charles: It was unavoidable whether he was an astronaut or not and whether he'd flown in space or not.  Host: Right.  John Charles: So we don't see bone-breaking episodes in astronauts that would not have broken their bones beforehand, but there's the risk that with even longer flights, longer than six months like Shane was on and longer than one year like Scott Kelly and Mikhail Kornienko were on, and perhaps, you know, two-and-a-half year Mars missions might be getting close to the threshold where you might start seeing a slight possibility, increased possibility of breaking bones under normal circumstances. Not during the mission, but after the mission when you're back on the Earth. You know, that's sort of, after 30 months, that's when you start getting close to that threshold.  Host: So it has to do with the time that you're in the weightless environment?  John Charles: It seems to be an ongoing process. And like I say, though, that process seems to be interrupted by the heavy resistive exercise.  Host: Right.  John Charles: So that sort of stretches that period out. So you're not at risk if you keep doing your heavy resistive exercise. But that's an interesting question too, and you haven't asked me that one yet, but I'll go ahead and answer it because--  Host: [laughs] You were just reading my mind.  John Charles: Yeah. That is, are we going to do resistive exercise on the Mars missions? And the answer is I hope so.  Host: Right.  John Charles: But we probably will not be using the ARED. The ARED is a very large device that takes up an entire module on the--  Host: Right.  John Charles: Space Station. It's a node, which is, that's a module. And we don't have, probably will not have that kind of real estate, that kind of volume available for that kind of device. So right now, what the Human Research Program is doing is trying to understand which of the exercises on the ARED are the most effective in protecting which of the bone facets that are important to protect. And then, building a smaller device that'll just do those. A tailored, specialized device. So this is maybe an important point to make, and that is astronauts will go on missions and will suffer deficits -- deficits that we know how to protect against because we can't afford to protect against them within the limited constraints of a spaceship. So we will give them a device that gives them certain exercise capabilities to protect them against deficits that we think are the most important. But we may be allowing the rest of other aspects of the, say, the other aspects of the skeleton to go ahead and atrophy just because we don't have the flexibility and the resources to protect them against that. We don't think that's going to put them at an increased risk because they're not going to be doing things that will need those aspects on the skeleton, for example.  Host: Right, so you've prioritized and you--  John Charles: We had to prioritize lots and lots of things when we start talking about a Mars mission.  Host: Right. Yeah. No--  John Charles: I knew we wanted to talk about a Mars mission [laughs] because that's the only thing you talk to me about ever.  Host: [laughs] Well, we were getting there.  John Charles: Yeah.  Host: I was taking baby steps.  John Charles: Yeah.  Host: And you just jump right there.  John Charles: I did. I did.  Host: [laughs] I guess, so how would the exercises, since we are on Mars now, how would the exercise work on Mars, you know, if you're talking about landing on -- would you kind of use sort of the same thing, or can you afford a different type of exercise?  John Charles: Well, it's going to have to be tailored for the Mars environment, and for the Mars environment means both exercising at one-third of a g, or 38% of Earth's normal gravity -- we call that a third of a g -- on Mars. And also, being appropriate for the spacecraft that will land on Mars. And you raised a very important question. I hope you realized you raised it because it's an important question.  Host: [inaudible] intentional.  John Charles: And that is, that's, it's a matter of economics to get to Mars. First, you got to build a spaceship, and then you got to send it there with fuel. And fuel is the coin of the realm in space. It takes lots, and lots, and lots, and lots of fuel to get any place. And if you get there, then it takes even more fuel to slow you down and land safely. So everything on the surface of Mars will be mass constrained and volume constrained because mass, volume requires mass. You know, if you build a small room, it's got less mass than a big room. So we are going to be focusing on not only what we can put into the Mars transit vehicle, which will be constrained by the volume of the vehicle, but also what we can land on Mars, which will be constrained by the volume of the lander and the mass capable of landing. So it may well be that we figure out, we hope we figure out a way to use that one-third of a g on Mars as a way to supplement some of the exercise that they would normally be doing in their mini-gym inside the Mars lander or the Mars habitat.  Host: Right, so when you're thinking about a Mars mission, it kind of goes back to that idea of prioritizing, right. So just as you're going to prioritize which parts of the body are the most sensitive--  John Charles: Right.  Host: The most important for you to maintain, when you're sending stuff to Mars, you got to prioritize which things are the most important things to bring, to send, and make sure they're really small, and light, and don't take up a lot of space.  John Charles: Small, and light, and don't take up a lot of space, and don't take a lot of energy, don't take a lot of mass, power, volume, which are the--  Host: Right.  John Charles: Important constraints of a spaceship. And just think, we started talking about this because I was trying to make the point that Shane's body is not back to normal yet still. It's, his bones are going to take months to get back to normal. But other organ systems may respond more quickly.  Host: But they will get back to normal? His, is the months?  John Charles: See, here's a metaphysical question -- what does normal mean in a case like this? Because your bone changes normally over the course of your lifetime, including over every six months. You know, he was gone for six months. His bone was going to be atrophying a little bit anyhow.  Host: Right.  John Charles: So we're not going to get him back to what he was before flight. And why would we? Because he wouldn't be at that condition now after his landing if he'd just been walking around the Earth for six months. Our goal is to get him back to where they need to be to live a full, happy, functional life here on Earth. But it's, you can't, you know, you can't go home again. You can't go back to your old skeleton again. It just, this is, things are different [laughs] with time in life, and that's doubly true for time spent in space.  Host: Yeah. It doesn't matter. You're always going to, just going to get older. Time's--  >> You're going to get older.  Host: Just going to go forward.  John Charles: That's right.  Host: But you, I guess, you know, bones are not the only thing you have to think about, right? You have to--  John Charles: That's correct.  Host: Think about a lot of other things. Shane mentioned, you know, when he landed and they pulled him out, he couldn't even turn his head. He was extremely dizzy.  John Charles: And see, I think this is the other extreme. The bones are the, some of the slowest to respond in spaceflight and some of the slowest to respond post flight during the recovery back on Earth, but the vestibular system is probably the fastest responder. The vestibular system is the organ system of balance, and it allows us to stay upright. We are constantly making adjustments in our bones and our muscles and the way they're lining our, lining us up. I mean, the old illustration is imagine balancing a broomstick. Remember broomsticks? We used to have brooms and broomsticks. And imagine balancing a broomstick upright on your, on the palm of your hand and all the adjustments you have to make to keep that upright.  Host: Right.  John Charles: That's how it is when you're walking. When you're walking and standing on one foot or even standing on two feet, your body is constantly adjusting its center of balance and its center of mass to stay over the center of pressure of the feet so you can stay upright. And that all requires sensors in the skin, sensors in the soles of the feet, sensors that detect the angles between the ankle, and the shinbone, and all the other bones, and the organs of balance inside the inner ear. And Gary, even though we're on a podcast, I am automatically pointing at my ears because the organs of balance are behind the inner ears.  Host: I can see.  John Charles: Yeah.  Host: [laughs] But I guess no one else can.  John Charles: Nobody else can. [laughs] But this organ system is exquisitely tuned to respond to motion and to respond to gravity. There are parts of it that detect how you move your head, and now I'm twisting my head left and right because that causes a sensation in my inner ear, which then is, at a most simple case, is translated to my eyeballs. So my eyes counteract the motion on my head so I can keep continuing to look at you while we're talking. But there are other organs that detect my tilting my head left and right, and those are the balance. So those are the otoliths. The other ones are the semicircular canals. But the otoliths, the otolith is ear stone, oto-lith.  Host: Okay.  John Charles: And those are little stones inside little sacs of fluid inside your head which detect which way down is. And those are the ones that are the most immediately affected by spaceflight and weightlessness because if your whole existence is predicated on detecting down and somebody takes away down, then what do you do? And that's sort of how the vestibular system responds to weightlessness is it spends a lot of time the first several hours or several days saying, oh my God. Oh my God. Oh my God. My only job is to detect down and there is no down. What do I do now? Now, I'm built, you know, the organs of balance are built to detect motion and to detect directions of acceleration, so they may get more sensitive. In fact, the little otoliths in your ears might become bigger. They might accrete more of the mineral that they're made of because they, they're sure there's a down there someplace and that if they could only get heavier, they might be able to detect it again.  Host: And this is over the first couple days of the spaceflight?  John Charles: Over the, it's over the course of the spaceflight.  Host: Oh, over the -- wow.  John Charles: Over the course of the spaceflight. Over the course of the first few days -- thank you for bringing me back to the point at hand -- [laughs] over the course of the first few days, essentially the brain says, you know what? You guys are just making gibberish. You're not making any sense anymore. I'm going to start ignoring you. Now, the brain doesn't actually use words. It just sort of economizes the metabolic energy. It says, I'm not going to put so much metabolic energy into the nerves that come from the vestibular system because--  Host: Right.  John Charles: I'm just getting gibberish from there and it just, it makes my, the stomach part of me sick. Let's just not pay attention so much to that anymore. And in fact, on Skylab, the American space station in the 1970's, when there was a rotating chair onboard specifically to see how often we could make astronauts sick in spaceflight -- rotating chairs are good ways to make people sick. If you rotate them and ask them to move their heads while they're rotating, that's a great way to be sick.  Host: Oh, yeah. I remember those chairs.  John Charles: Turns out after a few days in weightlessness, astronauts couldn't be made sick anymore by moving their heads while they were rotating because the--  Host: Yeah.  John Charles: Organs of balance had adapted and also because the stimuli were different.  Host: I've seen that video of Tim Peake, where I think it was Tim Peake and Tim Kopra, when they were both on the International Space Station--  John Charles: Yeah.  Host: Kopra took Peake and just spun him around really, really, really fast--  John Charles: Yep.  Host: And then stopped him suddenly. And Peake had like one moment where he stopped suddenly where, I mean, the whole time he was spinning, he didn't feel a thing.  John Charles: Yeah.  Host: And then, he stopped suddenly. He's like, \"Okay, I'm dizzy for a second.\" And now he's good.  John Charles: It's gone.  Host: Yeah.  John Charles: So there are quick responses, but as I say, you know, the organs of balance, vestibular system continue to, like I say, try to find gravity. And so they may actually increase the mass of the little stones inside your inner ears. And that's kind of an interesting novelty that nobody's figured out yet whether, what the functional -- operational, I should say -- significance -- functionally, we know what it means -- but operationally, what does it mean in terms of your ability to stand upright after you land on Mars? Or things like that. So there's lots of more, lots of research on, some topics for research that we can do in that domain. But the point I was trying to make originally is that this is a quick-responding organ system. Then, slightly slower will be the organs of your cardiovascular system. And those are all fluid based in the sense that they, you're a big, pressurized bag of fluid. Nothing personal, but all of us are. [laughs] And our goal is to stay pressurized by the function of our heart so that the blood can then perfuse the brain and also the blood pressure we carry around with us, 120/80, when the doctor does your blood pressure, tells you, yes, 120/80.  Host: That's a good one.  John Charles: That's the pressure that you need to get through the muscles when you're exercising. The, when your muscles are exercising, they're constricting and contracting. They're squeezing down the blood vessels. It takes a certain amount of blood pressure to push through there to deliver the nutrients that the muscles need to continue exercising. That's where your 120/80 comes from. And you have to continue building that pressure up. But in weightlessness, you're not exercising so much anymore. You're floating freely. You're relaxing, and your blood vessels are dilating, and your pressure, you'd actually lose blood volume in space. You may lose about a liter of blood in space.  Host: Wow.  John Charles: You may actually lose, that's about a blood donation, about the same amount as they take out of you when you donate blood, half a liter or a liter.  Host: Huh.  John Charles: Yeah, that's because the body's, the fluid distribution builds into it an assumption that a lot of your fluid is going to be down in your lower limbs because of gravity, and your lower limbs have a lot of veins, which are very floppy and good places to sequester extra fluid that you don't need, extra blood you don't need. And in weightlessness, that fluid is all shifted into the upper direction, and it's--  Host: Oh.  John Charles: There's not a lot of extra venous volume in the upper part of the body, and so the body says, aha, I've got a, I've got too much fluid onboard. I know what to do in a case like this. Decrease thirst, increase urination, you know, eliminate fluid elsewhere, shift it into other parts of the body, which has the effect of causing your body to lose blood volume over the course of the first few weeks in spaceflight.  Host: That was going to be my question.  John Charles: Yeah.  Host: Where does that liter go? Okay.  John Charles: Liter goes out, becomes tomorrow's coffee.  Host: Yeah. [laughs]  John Charles: You remember the old analogy about the water recycling system.  Host: That's right.  John Charles: So that fluid volume is appropriate for your time in weightlessness. And again, one of those tricks that you pull on your body is that you come back to the Earth after your time in weightlessness and suddenly that fluid drains back down to the lower part of the body. And then, suddenly, the upper part of the body is volume deprived, and that's when you may feel a little bit light headed, a little bit weak. Astronauts wear compression garments in the lower body -- in the legs, especially -- to squeeze to make sure the fluid stays up in the upper part of the body and not pooling in the lower part of the body. Shane was wearing those compression garments that are called Cantaver [phonetic] garments. That's the Russian name for Cantaver. [laughs] And it--  Host: Nice translation.  John Charles: Yeah. I'm good at that. But that, those are very effective techniques, and we are, we have other capabilities like that as well. But the point is during, while he wasn't being sensitive to emotion by not turning his head very much, he was also, his body was functioning to keep the blood flowing to the upper part of his body through his brain so he could continue to function normally. That's all part of the early re-adaptation process as well.  Host: That's right.  John Charles: So the vestibular system is quick responding. The cardiovascular system is slightly slower. Along the way, you lose muscle mass because you're not hefting your body mass around, and they have to rebuild that when you come back. And then, out there at the, sort of the tail end is your skeleton. What we haven't talked about before, yet, though, are things like your radiation tolerance, or radiation exposure, I should say.  Host: That's right.  John Charles: That doesn't plateau. That doesn't decrease. That doesn't accommodate because you keep getting exposed to radiation, and radiation has a cumulative effect. The more you--  Host: As long as you're in space--  John Charles: As long as you're in spaceflight. So that's an ongoing issue, and that's something we will have to deal with going to Mars because you're exposed to even more radiation when you leave Earth's magnetic field and are--  Host: Right.  John Charles: Exposed to the deep-space radiation. And then, the other aspects, of course, are the psychological aspects of spaceflight. And if you think what I've described to you before is complicated, you ain't seen nothing yet because the psychology [laughs] is one of the most self-regulating and self-protecting let's call it organ system that we have until it's not anymore. And so you adapt, you accommodate, you adjust. All those A words are the way that your [laughs] psychological aspects function in normal, everyday life and especially in spaceflight.  Host: Yeah.  John Charles: But you're exposed to stresses that are the most unique that anybody's ever been exposed to in spaceflight. And if we're talking about a Mars mission, we're talking about let's call it two and a half years just you and three other people face to face in the volume of a couple of Space Station modules maybe with the pressure and the eyes of the world on you to make sure you, to wonder if you succeed. So there's no pressure, obviously. And the, nobody can help you when you're on your way to Mars. At least, they can't help you immediately. There's going to be, when you get to Mars, you may be eight minutes away from Earth by radio.  Host: Right.  John Charles: At the midpoint of your stay on Mars, you might be 40 minutes away, 20 minutes away one way by radio.  Host: Yeah.  John Charles: So if you have a problem and it takes longer than, it takes less time than 20 minutes to fully express itself, and you don't know what you're doing, then you've got a big problem.  Host: That was one thing Shane said. He said, five minute, he landed. Five minutes, and everyone was, you know, taking him out of the capsule.  John Charles: That's right.  Host: And you're right. You're not going to have any--  John Charles: That's right.  Host: Not only no help, but it's going to be a while until actually someone talks to you.  John Charles: I like to paint a picture for people, and that is if you're the first person on Mars, you're climbing down the ladder, and you stumble and fall face first into the Mars dust, [laughs] the bad news is that everybody on Earth will see it because they're all going to be watching the live stream.  Host: Of course.  John Charles: But the good news is it'll be 20 minutes before they see it. [laughs] So you've got a few minutes of relief before you have to explain to the entire universe how you stumbled your, for your first step on Mars.  Host: [laughs] That would be pretty cool if that was the actual video of--  John Charles: Yeah.  Host: The first person stepping on Mars. [laughs] So obviously, you know, you have to be thinking about, you know, this is, obviously, you are thinking about, you know, this is kind of what that's going to look like if someone's going to land on Mars. You know, what are we doing to sort of get them ready for that? One of the things I think, I'm pretty sure Shane mentioned was they sat him in the seat and, for a while, and then they took him right to a tent and started doing some field tests on him.  John Charles: Yes, they're, exactly, and that's exactly what we called it. We call it the field test. It is, it's one of our Human Research Program investigations. It's a joint investigation by the U.S. and the Russians. The U.S. and Russian investigators Millard Reschke and Inessa Kozlovskaya are very longtime investigators, and they both have been anxious to do this kind of research on the adjustments of the sensorimotor system and the neurovestibular system to gravity after a long-duration spaceflight. We started doing this a few years ago. Chris Cassidy I think was the, actually the first guy to do it on his Soyuz landing.  Host: Oh.  John Charles: And we've been doing it pretty consistently since then to try and build up a database of responses so we know what an average, and, you know, what the statistical mean is, and what the variation is.  Host: Nice sample size.  John Charles: Nice sample size.  Host: Right.  John Charles: And it's also very dramatic, and it's also, it's a, an important set of things to do. But what it does briefly is after they're extracted from their Soyuz -- and you heard Shane talk about how they got out of the Soyuz with a lot of assistance. Nobody going to help you on Mars. Your vehicle has to be designed appropriately for you to get out on your own. Then, they set him in a chaise lounge for a little bit and have a brief public affairs event there on the steps of Kazakhstan, and that's a good chance for them to catch their breath. And then, they're carried, not walked, but they're carried into the medical tent. And inside the medical tent, in privacy because of human research concerns--  Host: Right, makes sense.  John Charles: They are unsuited -- that is, their space suits are taken off -- and then, then if they volunteered for this investigation, they go through a stylized set of motions. And they start off with being seated in a chair and just being asked to stand upright and stand quietly for 30 seconds or so.  Host: And that must be hard, though, right?  John Charles: That's a substantial stress, a substantial [inaudible].  Host: Yeah.  John Charles: Sonny Carter back on STS-33 I think it was said -- and that was after a five-day flight -- said the hardest thing he had to do on his spaceflight was stand up for the first time after a spaceflight out of the chair in the shuttle.  Host: Wow.  John Charles: So that was after just a few days. Now, this is after six months or so of weightlessness.  Host: Right.  John Charles: So that's the stress. We're watching their blood pressure, their heart rate, as well as their balance. And then, sort of to add insult to injury, one of the early things we do then is to lay them on the floor in the face down, in a prone position, and then ask them to stand up again. And it's, to mimic, it's called recovery from a fall. So the idea is that they have stumbled on Mars or they've stumbled on the Earth and they find themselves face down in the red dust on Mars like I've mentioned before. How long does it take to get back up again? And that we can quantify how long it takes them to stand up, to go through all the complicated motions of getting up on your hands, and getting up on your knees, and then finding a way to balance yourself and get back up. That's a very integrated physiological and, or musculoskeletal activity, and it's, it can be quantified. And then, once they've got them standing up again, and I always haste to add that no astronauts are actually pushed over. They're asked to lay down gently and then stand up.  Host: [laughs] That's funny because that would be very rude.  John Charles: That would be another good video. [laughs] But then, we make them walk an obstacle course to see if they can do it. And the obstacle course is actually, as Shane described, walking in a straight line with your eyes closed, or with your eyes open and then with your eyes closed. And sometimes, you know, eyes closed, you veer because you're using the, your visual system is your dominant way to orient yourself in the absence of a functional vestibular system and in the absence of a fairly relaxed set of somatosensory sensors. Those are the sensors that detect pressure on the bottom of your feet and at the angles of the joints, you know -- your ankle angles, and your elbow angles, and things like that. So walking with eyes open is always a challenge. Walking with eyes closed is almost always impossible because you veer immediately left or right because you just can't orient yourself in the absence of any inputs. And the inputs you're receiving are those that your brain has decided six months ago to ignore, and inputs that it wanted us, wanted to keep you've now deprived yourself of because your eyes are closed. So there's a little bit of a stressor there. And then, there are other things that we ask them to do as they sort of gradually move through this set of activities -- moving heavy masses back and forth as if they were unpacking a Mars lander and getting things set up on the surface of Mars, and, you know, just a bunch of generalized things like that involving motions, bending, twisting, standing still, you know, things like that. So--  Host: So how long does that usually take?  John Charles: It's about 45 minutes--  Host: Wow.  John Charles: In the tent, and that's only a subset. When they get back to Houston, there's a much longer set of measure, of activities they go through, and that'll be 24 hours after landing.  Host: Right.  John Charles: But we also test them in the airport in Karaganda, which is where the helicopter takes them after they land.  Host: Right.  John Charles: Or we test them in the airport either in Norway or in Scotland, depending on where the jet lands to refuel on the way--  Host: Their layover, right.  John Charles: On the way back. Their layover.  Host: Yeah.  John Charles: So that gives us, you know, minutes, and hours, and then a day of adaptation. And then, we watch them for several days post flight up to potentially even several weeks post flight to track their full recovery back to normal. And this is specifically to quantify the responses, the re-accommodation and re-adaptation back to gravity so engineers can design habitats and landers for Mars missions, and they'll know what capabilities astronauts will have to design around.  Host: Right.  John Charles: Now, smart fellow that you are, you're going to say, but John, you already said that Mars has only one-third of a g, and here we are making them do all this stuff at one g.  Host: Again, you're reading my mind. [laughs]  John Charles: We've worked together so much, I can anticipate your, almost your next thought. But the deal is, yes, we are making them do it at one g when normally on Mars they'd be at one-third of a g. All we've got is one g, and this is the closest we can get to that situation, so we have to--  Host: Right.  John Charles: Make the appropriate adjustments, if we think it's necessary, to compensate for the fractional gravity. But right now, in answer to your next question, we don't have any information on what fractional gravity does. And so we just have to assume that it will be as unpleasant, uncomfortable, difficult as one g is. And then, once we get experience at fractional gravity, like if we go to the Moon and get one-sixth of a g experience or if we land on Mars, and do it a few times, and say, you know what? That was not as hard as we said it was going to be. It's going to be easier here at one-third of a g. We can make the appropriate adjustments.  Host: Right. There's a lot deeper of a story here, I can tell.  John Charles: Yeah. [laughs]  Host: There's a lot of different directions we can go, but I'm going to ask one more question, and then we're going to let you go. So, you know, you have all these field tests, and you're kind of preparing for what, you know, what we have to do in order to make a Mars mission work. So I do have one, like, theoretical question for you: In a perfect world, if you were to land on Mars, what would you want that to look like? I'm guessing, I mean, can it be as simple as they land on Mars and they're good? They get out of the capsule. Or is there, you know, is there other things that we are going to have to sacrifice based on the knowledge we have now to make that as easy as possible?  John Charles: I think the answer is going to be yes and yes.  Host: Awesome.  John Charles: I think astronauts come in varieties just like other people do, and some people will have problems accommodating, adjusting, adapting, and others will not. Some folks are going to be able to land on Mars, and bounce right up, and feel like they want to go to work. We're probably going to insist that the landing vehicle be able to accommodate them for a couple of days.  Host: I see.  John Charles: Because we don't want to bet that they're all going to be perfect, they're all going to be bulletproof. And by perfect, I mean in this particular regard. Because they're all going to have, they're all going to be perfect in some way. It's not just, you know, the, not just the '70's kids. [laughs] We're all perfect in some way, but they're all not going to be perfect at adjusting to Mars. There's going to be some that are slower, and some that are faster, and some that are sort of run of the mill. We have to accommodate all of them because you can't leave the guy behind that's not feeling the best, then go and start exploring Mars.  Host: Right.  John Charles: So the goal is to make the landing vehicle as lightweight as possible. Previous discussion about mass, and power, and volume.  Host: Right.  John Charles: Which means minimize the amount of mass that you dedicate to life support systems. You don't want to build a two-week life support system into the lander if you're only going to use it for a couple of days, then you're going to feel good enough to go out and then traipse across the desert to the habitat that's waiting for you with all the life support you can use inside of it.  Host: Right.  John Charles: But you don't want to carry excess life support, but you don't want to carry too little life support in case it turns out to be, just by the luck of the draw, you've got four people that are going to have a tough time readjusting, and--  Host: Yeah.  John Charles: They don't want to get, put their space suits on and stumble across Mars face down into the dust, you know. Things like that.  Host: Yeah [inaudible].  John Charles: So what I would like to see the landing on Mars look like is that the entire crew feels good, and it was the luck of the draw that we got four people that just turned out to feel good this time. They're, they understand the importance of the design of the habitat, of the lander, so they take their time getting suited up and making the excursion out. Maybe they, maybe we're clever on the first landing and we don't make them actually walk very much at all. We make them have a radio-controlled rover that deploys from the habitat, and comes over, and is waiting out their front door on the lander. And they get into that, and they drive off to the habitat, and they get in, and set up housekeeping instead of actually having to stress themselves for the first time in a six- or eight-month period of time after they transited to Mars.  Host: That's a cool concept. Nice.  John Charles: So, you know--  Host: Valet service.  John Charles: Yeah, valet service. [laughs] And it might be even, may be even a self-driving car, so maybe Uber or--  Host: Yeah. [laughs]  John Charles: Google's going to have something to say about it.  Host: That's right.  John Charles: And then, they gradually become accustomed to their environment on Mars so they can go to work on Mars. The habitat will have the gym, whatever it looks like, as well as the food, and the fresh water, and the fresh air. But the point of all this is not to cater to the astronauts. The goal is to make sure that the astronauts are, as I like to say, in the best condition of their lives when they land so they minimize the time they spend readapting--  Host: Right.  John Charles: Because the Mars missions will be the most expensive undertakings humanity's ever embarked upon.  Host: Sure.  John Charles: And if we want to have a second, and a third, and a fourth, and a fifth one, the first one had better be productive. And the way to be productive is to be in good condition so you can get to work as quickly as possible, allowing for the accommodation time of a few days, or a week, or so, and then get to work, and show us why we sent you to Mars, and make those Nobel Prize winning discoveries on Mars so that Congress, and the parliaments of all the partner agencies, and everybody, all the taxpayers, think, yeah, that was a good thing. We want to do that some more. [laughs] We'll have more Mars missions and build up the flow to Mars and the infrastructure for Mars. So it's, it sounds like I'm altruistic, but Gary, you know me well enough to know that [laughs] I'm not altruistic. I want the astronauts to be in great condition when they land on Mars not just for themselves but for us too because if we have hopes of becoming a multi-planet society, our first emissaries to other planets will have to be, will have to demonstrate how productive we can be in other planets, and that's really the goal here.  Host: John, I want you to lead the charge and lead us [laughs] all the way to Mars.  John Charles: I'm not going to Mars, then.  Host: You'll be the guy landing. [laughs]  John Charles: I want to stay at home and cheer them on.  Host: [laughs] Well, this was awesome. Thanks for coming on the show and talking about, you know, really analyzing what Shane was feeling and what, why we are doing what we're doing, you know, obviously for later missions and landing on Mars. So obviously, you know, there's something that, there's some stuff that Dr. Charles was not able to address today, so for those listening, if you want to know more or you have a suggestion on what we need to talk about, stay tuned until after the music to learn on where and how you can submit some ideas. So John, thank you so much for coming on the podcast.  John Charles: Delighted. Thank you [inaudible].  Host: Glad to have you, and we'll probably have to have you again.  John Charles: Okay.  [ Laughs ]  [ Music ]  Host: Hey, thanks for sticking around. So I hope you enjoyed our talk with Dr. John Charles and Astronaut Shane Kimbrough. If you want to learn more about kind of all the things that specifically Dr. Charles talked about, there's, we actually have a website for that, per usual -- nasa.gov/hrp. This is the website for the Human Research Program, and you can learn about everything that they're studying there. All of these things that Dr. Charles was talking about -- the human body, bone density, even we have some stuff about the twin study that happened just actually a couple years ago now when Scott Kelly launched in 2015. So you can find all that information there. A lot of the research that's done and especially with Shane Kimbrough on the International Space Station was done up there on that orbiting complex. You can go to nasa.gov/iss to learn about the latest updates on the International Space Station -- all the latest blogs and scientific findings. We also have a lot of cool pictures that we like to put up on that website. On social media, we're very active. Facebook is the International Space Station. That's their Facebook page. On Twitter, we're @space, underscore, station. And on Instagram, it's @iss. If you want to submit an idea or you have a question about something that we talked about on the podcast, just use that hashtag #asknasa on your favorite platform. Doesn't matter. We'll check them all. And we'll make sure that we address it on one of the next podcasts that we do. And maybe we even will make a whole podcast out of, episode out of it. So this podcast was recorded on April 19th thanks to John Stoll and Eric Sparamin [phonetic] for helping to produce the show. Thanks again to Dr. John Charles and Shane Kimbrough for coming on the show. See you in 6.79 sols. Get it because the Mars? Okay. See you next time."

                        "description": "Dan Huot (Host):  Houston, we have a podcast.  Welcome to the official podcast of the NASA Johnson Space Center.  This is episode 43, diet like an astronaut.  I'm Dan Huot and I'll be your host today.  And on this podcast we bring in the experts.  NASA scientists.  Engineers.  Astronauts.  Anybody who can let you know about the coolest stuff going on right here at NASA.  Today we're talking about nutrition in space.  More specifically, what the astronauts have to eat to stay healthy and functional during long-duration space flight.  There's a lot of folks working on that right here at the NASA Johnson Space Center.  Including my guest Dr. Scott Smith, NASA nutritionist and the manager for nutritional biochemistry.  There's some pretty significant differences in the way astronauts have to eat in space versus the way we eat here on Earth.  And so we sat down to learn more about what the body needs to thrive in space.  And how we're preparing to tackle some big challenges for future long-duration missions into deep space.   So with no further delay, let's go light speed and jump right ahead to our talk with Dr. Scott Smith.  Enjoy.     [ Music ]  All right, I'm here with Dr. Scott Smith.  Scott, you're the, can I call you Scott?    Scott Smith:  You can call me Scott.    Host:  Scott, just for the sake of keeping things easy.  So you're the manager, and this is a mouthful as so of our guests are, for nutritional biochemistry.  You're a NASA nutritionist.  Start me off.  What does that mean?  What does your job kind of encompass here?    Scott Smith:  Well, the nutrition biochemistry lab is responsible for, in essence, keeping crews healthy from a nutrition point of view.  So we are not the food lab.  I'm always very quick to point out we don't make the Tang.  I don't have anything to do with the food.  Our job is to understand what the body needs.  And we provide data to the food lab that crew members need this many calories and this much protein.  Or this much carbohydrate.  Or this much vitamin A. Or vitamin E. Or vitamin D. Or iron.  Copper.  Sodium.  Zinc.  You name it.  So we're really the nutrient end of things.  And we do work with the crews to make sure they're eating well.  And then we try to study the body during flight.  In ground analogs to try to understand how we can modify nutrition to help keep crews healthier during space flight.    Host:  And it kind of amazes me that you go so in depth, you know.  You're not, the astronauts aren't just counting calories.  You're counting everything for them.  And, I mean, is this something we've always been doing with space flight?    Scott Smith:  Well, nutrition's always been important, first of all.  And, no.  In many cases on most flights, we've not annoyed the crew with nutrition.  Recently, about a year and a half ago, we flew an iPad app to the station that allows the crews to track their dietary intake.  And they report literally everything they eat.  Every single day, every single meal, they go into the app and enter what foods they ate.  Which gives them a real-time look on the iPad of how many calories they're getting.  Are they getting enough fluid?  Are they getting too much sodium?  But as you inferred, we get those data on the ground.  And we work that out to 180 different nutrients of, all the way down into the grid.  We were looking at iodine data this morning, to give you an idea.  And really, when you talk about human health and you talk about what we're trying to do, nutrition becomes very, very important.    Host:  I mean, especially when they're up there for a really long time I would imagine.     [ Multiple Speakers ]    Scott Smith:  Absolutely, absolutely.  And, indeed, on shuttle missions, nutrition was important.  But we always looked at nutrition as a camping trip on a shuttle flight.  That, you know, you could eat pretty much anything for two weeks and get away with it.  When you're up there for a month or three months, six months, it's important.  And as we look to go off beyond low Earth orbit at two and three years Mar's missions.  If you run out of a nutrient on one of those missions, you're going to be in trouble.    Host:  And so we talked a little bit before this.  And, I mean, this is something people have been paying attention to as long as humans have been exploring; right?  I mean, you almost don't think about it.  But then there's some pretty real examples that people will remember.    Scott Smith:  Absolutely.  And I don't think they realized it.  Much like today, they didn't appreciate nutrition.    Host:  Yeah.    Scott Smith:  You know, and I would say that everybody can see we're going to fly food on space missions because you got to fly food.    Host:  Yeah.    Scott Smith:  But the idea that we need to pay attention to what's in the food gets lost on a lot of people.  And I always say, you know, if you look back through the history books, nutrition in and of itself made or broke many of those exploration missions here on Earth.    Host:  Like what?    Scott Smith:  Well, the classic example is always scurvy, vitamin C deficiency.  And, you know, if you look at the time span between Columbus' trip and the invention of the steam engine.  It's about a 400-year block there.  Scurvy killed mover than 2 million sailors.    Host:  Really?    Scott Smith:  And it's estimated that scurvy killed more sailors than all other causes of death combined.  And there were ships that went out with hundreds that came back with tens.  It was that big a deal.    Host:  And it all came back to what they were eating?    Scott Smith:  It all came back to what they were eating and what they weren't eating.  That they weren't getting any or enough sources of vitamin C.    Host:  And what did they ultimately do to solve that?  I mean, I think we usually heard like starting eat, start carrying oranges and lemons and stuff; right?     [ Multiple Speakers ]    Scott Smith:  Exactly.    Scott Smith:  The British were called limeys because they used to bring limes on the voyages.  Because they realized that it was something in the citrus fruit.  It wasn't until the 1900s that they actually isolated and realized what that chemical compound was.  But they knew it was in citrus fruit.    Host:  But, I mean, even back then there were kind of attempts to figure out, okay, you know, my ship is coming back a whole lot lighter than it left.    Scott Smith:  Indeed.    Host:  Why the heck is that happening?    Scott Smith:  And, again, over those 400 years there were advances and setbacks.  Even after there was evidence that citrus fruit were the key, there were some captains that insisted that that was not it.  That they maintained that fresh meat and clean kitchens, clean galleys was going to solve this.  And then went out and found out the hard way that that was not true.  And my suspicion is that fresh meat came from the fact that, you know, on those ships, when they had grain and food stored.  They'd had rats stowaway on the ship.  And they would catch the rats.  And some of the crew would eat the rats.  And the crews that ate the rats tended to do better.  Because rats do not need vitamin C in their diet.  Rats can make vitamin C.    Host:  Really?    Scott Smith:  So if you ate the rat, it was an analogous to eating an orange.  Probably a little chewier.  But those crews tended to do better.  And it wasn't until they put all that together.  Well, I'm not sure they ever put the rat thing together.    Host:  Yeah.    Scott Smith:  But, again, that was missing one single nutrient.    Host:  Yeah.    Scott Smith:  If we, on a three-year mission, run out of any vitamin, any mineral, it's going to be a bad trip.    Host:  Well, luckily, we've come a whole lot further in the field of nutritional science since then.    Scott Smith:  Indeed.    Host:  So what are, you've been doing this for a while now.  What, I mean, so you're doing it with station now.  But you mentioned shuttle.  What were some of the kind of the early steps that you were taking in this field with space flight?    Scott Smith:  Well, we use any opportunity we can to try to understand how the body changes in weightlessness.  We use a lot of analogs.  We use things like bed-rest studies.  Where we put people to bed for weeks or months on end, trying to see how the body changes in, with disuse.  We've looked at vitamin D studies in the Antarctic, where people don't get sunlight.  Like on spacecraft.  So we study wherever and whatever we can to try to glean information about how the body changes.  And how we can use nutrition to help mitigate negative effects of space flight or to optimize crew health.  So we've done some studies on short-duration shuttle missions.  But it wasn't until we started long-duration flights that we really started to worry about nutrient requirements and what crews needed to eat.  And our first foray into that was the phase one program on the Russian space station Mir.  And we did some studies there looking at things like calcium.  And red blood cell metabolism.  And fluid homeostasis.   And then with the advent of, with the launch of Expedition One, we've been doing nutritional work in some form or other on every mission since then.  So we do nutritional assessments on the space station crews.  We're sort of the working for the flight surgeon.  We collect data on the crews before flight.  During flight.  And after flight.  To make sure that we send astronauts up there as healthy as can be.  That we track them while they're up there to make sure they're staying healthy.  And then when they land, we go off and we collect blood samples and urine samples to see if there are any decrements.  That we work with the rehabilitation team to get crews back to full health as quickly as possible.    Host:  Well, what have you seen?  So you've been doing this on station for a long time now.  You did some stuff on Mir.  What have you guys kind of, what did you start out looking for kind of?  What is the body needing in microgravity that it's not, it wasn't necessarily getting?  Or how did nutrition, let me put it this way.  How did nutrition requirements change for an astronaut as opposed to, you know, me down here on planet Earth?  Or do they?    Scott Smith:  There are a few nuanced differences.  But really many of the basics still apply.  When I meet with the crews before flight, the first thing I tell he them is that, if there's only one thing I can tell you, it's that you need to eat during flight.  And that sounds ridiculous, but you need to maintain your body mass.  You need to get enough calories in you to maintain your body mass.  If you're doing that, that is 70 percent of the battle.  And the reason for that is that, if you're getting enough calories, everything else follows calories.  So if you're getting enough calories, you're probably getting enough of the body weight.  You're probably getting enough of the minerals.  You're probably getting enough fluid.  And when we get caloric intake right, then we start to look at other things.  Like are you getting enough protein?  Are you getting enough calcium?  Are you getting enough potassium?  And we start to fine tune.  But really maintaining body mass is goal one.  We know from many flights that, if you lose weight during flight, that you'll lose more bone than you want to.  You'll lose more muscle than you need to.   Your cardiovascular system doesn't like it.  There's more oxidative damage that occurs if you're not getting enough calories.  So there's a lot of negative things that come along with weight loss in astronauts.  And I always say this is not the weight loss program you want to go on.  Over the years, early on in the Mir program, in the early station, we saw a lot of crews lose weight.  There were a lot of people that maintained that, well, astronauts just lose weight in flight.  We need to accept that that's normal.    Host:  Yeah.    Scott Smith:  And I always fault that.  And it wasn't until, in 2008 was when we flew the, what we call the ARED, the advanced resistive exercise device.  That device that allowed really heavy resistive exercise.  And what we showed in the first crews that used that was that, if you ate well.  Maintained your body mass.  Had good vitamin D status.  And exercised hard.  You could maintain your bone mineral density.  And my throw down on there was always that in 50 years of flying people in space, that was the first time we ever saw crews coming back with the same bone mineral density they left with.    Host:  And it was by actually paying attention to.     [ Multiple Speakers ]    Scott Smith:  Nutrition and exercise.    Host:  Every factor not just accepting, hey, this is something we got to live with.    Scott Smith:  Exactly, exactly.  And, you know, the adage always is that, you know, good nutrition won't make you an Olympic athlete.  But if you're an Olympic athlete, bad nutrition will ruin you.  And it's the same mantra.  That, you know, we come up with an exercise that does a really good job of fixing muscle loss.    Host:  Yeah, yeah.    Scott Smith:  But if you're not providing enough fuel to support that exercise, that exercise won't work.    Host:  And then how are you guys actually making sure that the crew members are getting what they need?    Scott Smith:  We, in two ways.  Again, we have an iPad app that the crews track dietary intake.  That allows them to see literally at lunchtime what they need to eat for dinner to get enough calories.  It's got a little bar at the bottom of the page that starts off at red.  And as they eat more calories, it turns to green.  So we push them daily, hour by hour to get to the top of that bar.  We track their body mass.  And if they're losing weight, again, that's the tell.  And we've had some crew members that, you know, when we say you're not eating enough.  You're not getting enough calories.  They will, you know, push back and say, look, I feel fine.  You know, I feel like I'm eating enough.  I don't know what you're talking about.  I always tell them, if you're losing weight, I'm right.  That it's possible your metabolic rate is different.    Host:  Yeah.    Scott Smith:  Maybe lower than it is on Earth.  Or lower than we think it is.  But, again, the body weight is the tell.  That, if you're body mass is going down, there's something wrong.  And one of the things that we've come to, and I don't have data to back this up.  But I think one of the things that happens during flight is that food doesn't settle in your stomach the same way as it does on Earth.    Host:  Really?    Scott Smith:  So as you eat here on Earth, eventually your stomach will tell your brain that you're full.    Host:  Yeah.    Scott Smith:  In space what I think what happens is because the food in your stomach is experiencing the same weightlessness, it probably is stretching that stomach more.  So hitting the top of your stomach more, which is, signals your brain that you're done.  Even though you haven't really eaten that much.  And I tell crews, again, you've got to get food in you.  And if you're losing weight, you either need to push more food in even when you think you're full.    Host:  Yeah.    Scott Smith:  Or you need to eat more meals.  You need to spread it out during the day and snack more.  Or whatever it takes to get more calories in you.    Host:  It's actually interesting.  We've been asked that question before.  You know, does the digestive system change at all?  And it's always kind of a, no, we don't think so.  So that might actually be out there still.  So we're still learning stuff.    Scott Smith:  Exactly, exactly.    Host:  Are there foods that you try to make them eat more of?  Eat less of?  Because, I mean, everything's pretty regulated, I would imagine.    Scott Smith:  Well, there's a couple ways to answer that.  We, the food system is somewhat limited.  And it is repetitive.  So every eight days or so they change out the containers and get a new set of the same thing every eight days.  So there's not a lot we can tell them to do.  And for a lot of reasons we don't, you know, obviously, I try not to nag them on, you know, I don't want to be the guy telling them to eat more broccoli.  Especially if they hate broccoli.  But trying to get a balanced meal in them.  And trying, you know, one of the challenges we have is getting enough food up there.  Enough variety of food that each individual crew member can find enough things that will make them happy.  So for the crew, if it doesn't like broccoli, will they eat asparagus?  Will they eat green beans?  Will they eat something else?  Because you got to get something green in you no matter what.  As we look out to exploration missions and the challenges there, we want an optimal diet.   We want an optimized diet.  And in our view that means more fruits and vegetables.  Which have phytochemicals that come along with that.  It means more sources of omega three fatty acids.  So things like salmon and fish and walnuts.  And, again, doing what we can with that personal choice of making sure the crews are interested enough in eating that they're going to eat.  You know, again, go back to their eight-day rotating menu.  I would say, if you pick your eight favorite days of food and you cycle it enough, after enough times you're going to get bored.  I don't care if it's steak and lobster and whatever else.  Whatever it is you like.    Host:  I feel like I've already been doing that the last five years of my life.    Scott Smith:  If you eat the same thing every Tuesday.    Host:  Yeah, yeah, yeah.    Scott Smith:  Sooner or later we know you get bored of that.    Host:  I think every college student can attest to that.    Scott Smith:  Exactly.  You can only do ramen so many days in a row.    Host:  Well, so what about, you know, the future?  What are you guys already looking at that you're considering is going to have to change upwind.  Because we have crew members up in the air for six months.  We had Scott Kelly up there for a year.    Scott Smith:  Yeah.    Host:  What's going to change in the world of nutrition?  What are you guys, you know, not necessarily worried about.  But what problems are you already trying to solve?  Or anticipating if someone's going to be up there for two, three years at a time?    Scott Smith:  We're still, there's a number of serious health concerns that we worry about.  That, again, a six-month mission is worse than a three-month mission is worse than a two-week mission.  And then when you add in a year or two-year mission, it just, it exacerbates that.  We worry about things like bone loss.  And muscle loss.  And how your cardiovascular system works.  We worry about the immune system function.  And all four of those are intertwined with nutrition.  We know, if you don't eat well, your immune system function doesn't work as well.  We know from our work in the Antarctic that, if you are stressed and you're vitamin D status is low.  You will reactivate more viruses, which is a function of your immune system, than you want.  Your behavior.  Your performance.  Your morale are all based on how well you're eating.  How well you're sleeping goes hand in hand with how well you're eating.   So lots of different months of human adaptation rely on a good food system and good food intake.  And then you take into account the fact that you're in a spacecraft.  You're in microgravity.  The air is closed.  So any contaminants in the air can alter that.  There's some things, you know, high levels of carbon dioxide can affect different nutrient metabolism.  It can affect bone loss.  Different chemicals and contaminants in the air can affect nutrient requirements like folate.  And other vitamins can be exacerbated by that.  And one of the bigger, if not the biggest issue we chase is radiation.  And that's one of those things that, again, it's, radiation exposure is higher on station than it is on Earth.  But when you leave the protection of low Earth orbit, it gets really bad.  So radiation exposure on a moon mission or Mars mission and how we protect from that is going to be serious.    Host:  And that's something nutrition can help address?    Scott Smith:  That is something that nutrition can help address.    Host:  How?    Scott Smith:  When you look at, you know, studies on the ground.  People that eat more broccoli and cauliflower, cruciferous vegetables, get less cancer.    Host:  Wow.    Scott Smith:  Do we know exactly why?  No, we do not.  And we, you know, people are always looking for what vitamin is it that I can take a pill of that will mitigate that?  We don't have that yet.    Host:  Yeah.    Scott Smith:  And there's been a number of studies done where for a while we thought vitamin A was going to cure cancer.  Vitamin E was going to cure cancer.  And we did long-term prospective studies where, you know, ten-year studies where we looked at vitamin E supplementation.  Or vitamin A supplementation.  Beta carotene supplementation.  And when they do those big studies, big controlled studies, what they find is that taking vitamins does not mitigate that risk.  But, again, when you compare to people that eat more vegetables, they get less cancer.  Now, there's a couple things intertwined in there that you need to be careful of.  One is that there are thousands of these, what we call phytochemicals that occur in things like broccoli.  And we don't understand all of them.  So it may be that it's not just vitamin E or vitamin A.    Host:  It's some mix of.    Scott Smith:  It's some mix of those other things.  The other thing is that the more broccoli you eat, the fewer french fries you eat.  The fewer, less red meat you eat.    Host:  That's true.    Scott Smith:  And those things likely antagonize oxidative damage and cancer incidence.  So it really, you know, I always hate to say it, but your mother was right.  And eating your vegetables really does matter.    Host:  I'll make sure they does not listen to this podcast.  Well, so what are some of the other major changes for when we have people in space for a really long time?  One thing that I have written down here, need less iron and sodium.  Now, why does that happen?  What is the body going through that that becomes the case?    Scott Smith:  Two different things there.  One, with iron, your iron stores go up during space flight because your blood volume contracts.  So when you go into space flight, that, what happens is your blood volume goes down by about 10 to 15 percent.    Host:  Really?    Scott Smith:  Yeah.  And, again, I don't have date to back this up exactly.  But what I think happens, the way I explain this in my head is that it's easier for the body to pump blood to your toenails than it is on Earth.  You don't have gravity fighting against you, so it's easier to pump the blood.  You don't have blood pooling in your, you know, in your feet.    Host:  Yeah.    Scott Smith:  So your body can get away with a smaller blood volume.  And what happens because of that is your blood volume contracts, again, by about 10 or 15 percent.  What happens is, as you breakdown the red blood cells you don't need, you put that iron into stores, okay.  So you don't need as much iron as you need on Earth, first of all.  Second of all, when you have higher iron stores, and we know this from a lot of studies on Earth that have nothing to do with space flight.  Higher iron stores are associated with higher oxidative damage in tissues.  And we've actually shown that with high, the astronauts that have higher iron stores.  Because they ate more iron.  Because they had higher stores to begin with, have more oxidative damage to their DNA.  And have more bone loss secondary to that oxidative stress.  So we try to minimize the amount of iron they're getting in their diet.  Now, that's not to say, you know, we'd be happy with the RDA.   Which is about 8 or 10 milligrams of iron per day.  The standard food system right now has about 25 milligrams a day.  And depending on how each astronaut picks their food, if you pick foods that are, you know, either high in iron.  Like sources of meat.  Or fortified foods like breakfast drinks.  And cereals that are fortified with iron.  We've seen crews get 30, 40, 50 milligrams of iron a day.  Which is a good four or five, six times the RDA.    Host:  What's RDA?    Scott Smith:  The recommended dietary allowance.    Host:  Okay.    Scott Smith:  So that's the, you know, when you look at the food package in the grocery store.    Host:  Yep.    Scott Smith:  It's based on your typical dietary intake, if you will.    Host:  Got you.    Scott Smith:  So we're not looking to reduce iron below what your average person needs.  But on Earth we tend to worry about the opposite.  We worry about people being iron deficient.    Host:  Yeah.    Scott Smith:  Most nutrients follow what we call a bell-shaped curve.  That is, that at the bottom end of the bell-shaped curve, you don't want to be in the bottom 5 percent.     [ Multiple Speakers ]  But the reality is you don't want to be, you don't to have too much either.    Host:  Yep.    Scott Smith:  And we're starting to see that in terrestrial science that individuals that have higher iron stores have higher cardiovascular diseases.  Have higher cerebrovascular diseases.  That is, blood vessel changes and brain changes.  And, again, we're seeing decrements, problems with having too much iron that are just as bad as problems of having too little iron.  Sodium, on the other hand, is one of those things that we worry about crews using too much sodium for the same reason as on Earth.  Because too much sodium is bad for you.    Host:  But it tastes so good.    Scott Smith:  And that is the problem.  Not only that it tastes really good, but it's cheap.    Host:  Yeah.    Scott Smith:  So if you want to make something taste better and not cost much, throw some salt on it.    Host:  A little bit of salt, yeah.    Scott Smith:  You could do the same thing with spices.  Spices are a lot more expensive.  So if you're a food company trying to make whatever, macaroni and cheese.  You know, or soup.  Or whatever you want.  It's much cheaper and much more palatable to add sodium to it.    Host:  But you're not watching out for sodium for any particular reason when [inaudible]?     [ Multiple Speakers ]    Scott Smith:  Well, one of the key, well, there's several things we're concerned about.  On Earth, with sodium, we worry about blood pressure.  And we're not worried about that in astronauts.  Because blood pressure actually is a little bit lower during flight.  The astronauts, by virtue of the selection process, typically don't have blood pressure issues.  High sodium levels are bad for bone, which is something we're concerned about.  And there's the potential that high sodium intakes can exacerbate some of the fluid volume issues.  And some of the eye issues that have jumped up in recent years.  And that is one of the reasons why we reformulated our food system, I think about five years ago now, to be much lower in sodium than it was.  So we actually reduced the sodium content of the space foods by about 40 percent compared to what they were to try to help with some of these health issues.  And the big one was, the big driver was eye issues.    Host:  Eye issues.  So we've talked about bone and muscles.  And even radiation.  But the vision issues.  So, and for those that don't know, some of the astronauts actually experience a loss in their visual acuity.  Their vision gets worse over long-duration space flight.  And then it always doesn't get better; is that correct?    Scott Smith:  That's exactly right.  That we, I'll say around eight years ago or so, nine years ago realized that we had some crew members coming back having had eye and vision issues.  I say vision issues because it's easier to say than ophthalmologic issues.    Host:  That is easier.    Scott Smith:  And in some cases it's a change in what we call refraction.  Which is your ability to focus.  Some of them are a little more nuanced than that.  Where, when the eye docs do an examine of the astronauts after flight, they see changes in the back of the eye that some astronauts have had, but didn't realize they had.  So it's not necessarily perceptible by the astronaut.  But there's a varied pattern of five or so different things that occur with the eye.  Changes in ability to focus.  Changes in the back of the eye, what they called cotton wool spots.  Which are little spots that occur on the back of the eye.  Changes in the shape of the eye.  Number of things going on.  As I said, up until about seven, eight, nine years ago, we didn't realize that was a problem.  Now, when that came up, we all collectively blustered down the intracranial pressure pathway, as I call it.  That is, the thinking was, the theory was that, when you go into space flight, the fluid shifts.   And you get more blood and fluid up into your head.  That that pressure inside your head pushes on the back of your eye.  Pushes on your optic nerve.  And that intracranial pressure leads to these eye changes.  Now, what is important to keep in mind, and the drum I continually bang is what you said at the outset.  Which is some astronauts develop this.    Host:  Yeah.    Scott Smith:  It's not all of them.    Host:  It's not.    Scott Smith:  So it can't just be as simple as, when you go into flight, the fluid goes up, pushes on your eye.    Host:  Because they all have that.    Host:  Right.  They all have that.  We at one point, and there's still some thinking that it might be related to carbon dioxide.  Because carbon dioxide in the air is higher during space flight than it is on Earth.  The cabin on, the cabin CO2 on ISS is higher than the CO2 you and I are breathing.  Maybe not in this room.    Host:  There's good airflow in here.  It's a small room.  There's good airflow.    Scott Smith:  Okay.  No worries.  It may be CO2.  It may be fluid shifts.  It may be something else.  But what we always come back to is that it is only affecting some of the astronauts.  Now, when this came up, we went to the flight docs and said, look, you know, we've got a lot of data.  We've done this experiment on space station.  We've collected blood.  We've collected urine.  We've looked at a lot of nutritional markers and biochemistry markers.  Maybe we have something that could help understand this.  And when we dug into the data, and today's February 16th.  It was February 18th of 2011 that my colleague Sarah [inaudible] came into my office and said there's something going on with one carbon metabolism.  And without boring you with all the details, what she found was differences in the blood biochemistry of the astronauts that had these vision issues before flight.    Host:  Before flight.    Scott Smith:  Before flight we saw differences in the blood in astronauts that subsequently developed eye issues.    Host:  So with that you could potentially tell before somebody even went into space.    Scott Smith:  Indeed.    Host:  Whether or not they have that issue.    Scott Smith:  Indeed.  So we followed up on that.  We presented that to life sciences management.  We ruled out as many things as we could.  You know, the possibility that it was vitamin deficiencies.  Or kidney function.  Or all these different things.  We ruled those all out.  And what we then hypothesized was that it was related to genetics.  That there were genetic differences, in the literature we knew there were genetic differences that affected the chemicals we were looking at.  And these affect the population.  That's sort of like blood types.  That people have different blood types.    Host:  Yeah.    Scott Smith:  You're either blood type A or B or O. It's not a good blood type or a bad blood type, there's just different blood types.  There's differences in genetics that affect these chemicals.  And we hypothesized that that may be why these chemical differences are there.  And there may be something related to that which is causing those individuals to be predisposed to developing these eye issues on space station.  So we did a study where we proposed looking at a handful of these genetic differences.  We sat down with 70 astronauts and said, you know, look, here's the story.  Here's the data we've got.  Here's the theory.  We'd like to collect some blood from you and look at your genes.  We said it was 70 astronauts, and all 70 of them agreed to give us blood.  Which gives you an idea of how compelling the story was to them.  And how big a deal this is to astronauts.  And how much they want to understand this to figure this out.    Host:  I always say they're incredibly selfless because they're basically guinea pigs.    Scott Smith:  Yeah, absolutely.    Host:  While they're up there.    Scott Smith:  Absolutely.     [ Multiple Speakers ]    Host:  So it's incredible that they're.    Scott Smith:  And the astronauts as a whole are great about doing experiments.  But I always, you know, I've always said, all the astronauts will never agree to anything.  That, you know, there's always 95 percent of them.  There's always one or two, they're like, well, I don't like to collect blood or.    Host:  Yeah.    Scott Smith:  Cardiovascular study.  Or I don't want to do that sleep study.  I've never even everybody sign up for a study until now.    Host:  And so it's still ongoing?    Scott Smith:  It, we're in stage two now.  But when we collected the blood, we did a small look at the genetics.  And found, indeed, that there was a genetic predisposition for some astronauts to develop these eye issues.  And we now need to follow up on that.  We're doing some more extended work.  Again, I can talk to you a long time about that.  But I'd be more boring than I already am.  And it gets pretty gnarly into the genetics and the biochemistry.  But I am convinced that we are at the cusp of this thing.  And if we can work it out to where we can study this in a little more detail, that we will solve this problem.    Host:  Wow.    Scott Smith:  To where we can get into what we call personalized medicine.  And we can look and say, okay, we know these individuals are going to be, are at risk of this developing.  Here's how we go try to counteract that.    Host:  Really?  And so that's the important part.  Is it's not identifying, hey, this is going to happen to you.  It's, hey, this might happen to you, and this is how we stop it.     [ Multiple Speakers ]    Scott Smith:  And here's how we fix it.  Absolutely.    Host:  And so we've come all the way from why is half of my ship dying from some crazy thing.  To now we're looking at eyes.  So it seems like, obviously, it's a constantly evolving field.  Are there other things or anything on the horizon that you think you're going to be diving into next?    Scott Smith:  Well, right now the vision thing is, as I call it, is the biggest thing we're chasing.    Host:  Yeah.    Scott Smith:  And that is one of the top concerns that NASA management has in terms of health risks.  One of the interesting spinoffs of the work that we've done is that, is we wrote up the genetic data.  We published that in a scientific paper.  One of the realizations we came to was that the astronauts that developed these vision issues had a long list of characteristics.  This chemistry.  The genetics.  Changes in their retinal nerves.  Changes in some of their hormones.  There was a list of about eight or nine things that we had that we found a clinical population that had the exact same set of characteristics.  And that is women with polycystic ovary syndrome.    Host:  Really?    Scott Smith:  Really.  Polycystic ovary syndrome, or PCOS as they call it, is the leading cause of infertility in women.  It affects 10 to 20 percent of women.  Which is a staggering incidence.    Host:  Yeah.    Scott Smith:  And what we maintain is that, you know, I talked a lot about analogs.  That we look at the Antarctic as analog to study vitamin D. Or we look at bed rest as an analog for studying bone loss.    Host:  Yeah.    Scott Smith:  We maintain that women with polycystic ovary syndrome might be the analog population we need to study to figure out what's different about them.  And how that relates to astronauts during space flight.    Host:  Go you.  I was wondering, like, what, so if you find that out, what's the purpose of finding that out [inaudible]?    Scott Smith:  Because we can then study their cardiovascular function.  We can study their eyes.  We can study, you know, different elements of their physiology to understand what's different about them.  Because, theoretically, if we flew women with PCOS in space, again theoretically, they would all develop these eye issues.    Host:  Yeah.    Scott Smith:  We've started a study that we're doing with the Mayo Clinic up in Minnesota.  Working with an endocrinologist who specializes in PCOS and a neuroophthalmologist.  Which is even harder to say.  A neuroophthalmologist that specializes in intracranial hypertension.  And they're off recruiting women with PCOS.  Patients with intracranial hypertension.  Where they're collecting blood and shipping them to us and doing eye exams.  And, again, we hope to piece together the first bits of that.  So we can then test our hypotheses for what we think is the relationship between your genetics and your eyes.  And how those change during space flight.  So that, you know, again, ultimately those studies can help us better understand how to prevent astronauts from having eye issues.  The more staggering thing is that we might be able to help terrestrial medicine to understand how to better treat individuals with that syndrome.    Host:  Yeah.    Scott Smith:  And I'm always struck by one of the cases where we published the genetic data back in 2016.  And when we published the paper, NASA put a story on the web about, you know, that we published the study.  And what we found and what it meant.  And I got an e-mail from a woman working at one of the other NASA centers who asked if we'd looked at this one eye issue called papilledema.  And I said, well, in our paper we called it choroidal folds.  But I'm told they're about the same thing.  But, yes, we did and here's a copy of the paper.  And she wrote back and said.  Well, to share too much, I six, seven years ago was diagnosed with papilledema.  That there was some sort of pressure pushing on the back of my eye that they couldn't figure out why.  Along the way I was diagnosed with B12 deficiency.  Which is one of the things intertwined with the genetics we're looking at.  And, oh, yeah, by the way, she's got PCOS.    Host:  Wow.    Scott Smith:  And that could be a coincidence.  I don't think so.    Host:  Wow.    Scott Smith:  And she said, when she had mentioned to her physicians that maybe these things were interrelated.  And she said they scoffed at her and said, no, that can't be.  So, again, we talk a lot about spinoffs from the space program.  It is mind-boggling to think that by studding this in more depth.    Host:  Yeah.    Scott Smith:  We might be able to help 10 to 20 percent of the population.    Host:  Wow.  Well, wow, I've said that like a million times already.  But, wow.     [ Multiple Speakers ]    Host:  Keep going.    Host:  So besides the vision, everything that we've been learning on the space station about trying to solve the vision issue.  Bones.  Muscle.  And cardiovascular everything.  How are you feeling with what we know right now about supporting the nutrition for our crews, say going to Mars?  Going into space for two years?    Scott Smith:  Again, the human research program has a top four, if you will.  And I don't mean to speak for HRP, but their top four our radiation.  Behavior and performance.  Vision.  And food.  And I say food intentionally.  It's not nutrition.  Because the reality is for a Mars mission, the food is probably going to go to Mars before the crew leaves Earth.  So we need to have a food system that is stable for five years.  Meaning you could go to the grocery store right now.  Pack your pantry.  And in five years still be eating that food.  And make sure that it's got everything you need in it.    Host:  And I imagine there's a million and one challenges.     [ Multiple Speakers ]    Scott Smith:  And it's extremely tough to do.    Host:  Yeah.    Scott Smith:  It's extremely tough to do.  The food system folks are working really hard on developing foods that are more stable.  Working on packaging that will help facilitate that.  But, again, when you think about it, when you find something in the back of your pantry that's been in there are for a while.  It's got an expiration date on it.  The expiration date is because it probably doesn't taste that good.  The reason it probably doesn't taste that good after that date is because the nutrients that are in there break down and make other chemicals that aren't what they were supposed to be.  So it tastes funky or it looks funky.  So from a pure food point of view, there's a lot of issues.  From a nutrition point of view, we need to make sure we've got the basics down.  One of the nice things we have on space station is that, every time a vehicle goes up, there's some fresh food in there.    Host:  Yeah.    Scott Smith:  There's, you know, oranges.  And lemons.  And apples.  And different types of fruits and vegetables.    Host:  Got to stave off the scurvy.    Scott Smith:  Exactly.  And we really don't know how much that little bit of fresh food mitigates concerns we have about the rest of the food system.  We're not going to have the ability to do that with a Mars crew.  So we need to be very sure of that.  We need to make very sure the food, again, is good enough that the crew's going to want to eat it.  We're going to make sure that the crew is motivated enough that they're going to want to eat it.  That they're exercising hard enough to maintain their body to keep, again, that whole thing going.  So it, you know, when you look at scientists, we all tend to focus on our little system.  So there's a bone lab.  And a muscle lab.  And a cardiovascular lab.  And a nutrition lab.  We're dealing with a human.  And that whole thing has to work.  And that still gives me a significant amount of pause.  We don't really know what extent the effects of the radiation system are going to be.  Chronic, relatively low dose, but much higher than on Earth.  Levels of radiation for long periods of time can affect, you know, I was at a meeting last week where the radiation folks talked about that.   And talked about how, you know, you get dementia-like problems with extended radiation exposure.  And, again, from a nutrition point of view, I will tell you that in the elderly with dementia and cognition problems, folate.  Which is one of the vitamins, vitamin B12 are key nutrients when it comes to cognition.  And one of the things that we think is going on is that radiation affects the ability to get those vitamins into the brain.  So there are a lot of challenges ahead of us that we really do not understand.  If we had a vehicle that was ready to go tomorrow.  We had a food system that was ready to go tomorrow.  Do we know enough about what it really is going to take to protect crews on a three-year trip to Mars?  Those really are scary questions.    Host:  Yeah.    Scott Smith:  Really they are.    Host:  Well, luckily we still got an International Space Station and some time to figure all that out.  I've taken up a bunch of your time.  Anything else that I didn't hit on that you're dying to go tell the world about nutritional biochemistry?    Scott Smith:  No.  I think we've hit most of the key points.  We, you know, are working as hard as we can.  And I always like to step back from the realization that, you know, I get to come sit here with you and tell you the great stuff we're doing.  Realize I've got a lab full of folks that are back at the lab working hard.  That are doing the really hard work.  And they should get most of the credit.  But I don't let them out of the lab so, you know, they're working.  But it really is a phenomenal team effort that helps to bring all this together.   Host:  How's their vitamin D intake?    Scott Smith:  We let them out in the sun every once in a while.  But it is a tremendous team effort within our group.  And then we work with a number of other groups.  We work with the cardiovascular lab to try to understand a lot of the cardiovascular and vision issues that we've talked about.  Work with the immune lab.  Work with the muscle lab.  We work with a lot of other folks.  There really is a tremendous team environment trying to pull this thing together.  It's not, really is not just me.    Host:  Well, you're all doing some incredible work right now.  And looking forward to the next breakthroughs in the years to come.    Scott Smith:  Thanks.    Host:  And what the future holds.  Again, I was just talking with Dr. Scott Smith, the manager of nutritional biochemistry here at the Johnson Space Center.  Scott, thanks so much for joining me today.    Scott Smith:  Thank you.

                        "description": "Gary Jordan (Host): Houston, We Have a Podcast.  Welcome to the official podcast of the NASA Johnson Space Center, Episode 46: Stories of Unity.  I'm Gary Jordan, and I'll be your co-host today, along with Adam [inaudible] Chair of the Asians Succeeding in Innovation and Aerospace employee resource group, conveniently spelling out ASIA here on site.  Adam, thanks for coming on.    Adam Kalil:  Oh, thanks, Gary.  Glad to be here.    Host:   So we've have had some employee resource groups on the podcast before.  And we've had the African-American resource group and the Women's resource group.  So what are the goals of the one you chair, ASIA?    Adam Kalil:  Okay.  Employee resource groups are established to foster an inclusive workplace.  Like all other non-ERG's, ASIA's ERG goal is faster, collaborative, and inclusive workplace to bring about innovative solution to NASA's mission.  Second, influence hiring and employee retention to gain and retain talent and bring new perspectives through active engagement.  Three, raise awareness of JSC policies and processes.  Fourth is serve as cultural ambassadors to fuel better engagement to the management team.  Fifth is transform employees into think tanks and build a talent pipeline, increasing representation and inclusiveness.    Host:   All right, really hitting it all.  So Adam, May is Asian-Pacific American Heritage Month.  So what is the significance of this month to you?    Adam Kalil:  Yeah, sure.  Highlighting this month is important to recognize the remarkable contributions by the previous generations of Americans of Asian and Pacific Islander descent.  Also, it's important to understand the cultural differences within the JSC workforce which can make it easier for us to relate to the people that have different backgrounds and together we build a lasting legacy for a more inclusive workplace.    Host:   Yeah.  And so that's what we're doing today, we're engaging with the Asian-Pacific American community.  So Houston, We Have a Podcast is teaming up with ASIA for Asian-Pacific American Heritage Month to tackle this theme of unity.  And we've wrangled four guests from different backgrounds across the center in fields like exploration, safety, procurement, and the International Space Station.  And then we'll get to hear their story and how they got to NASA, and then what they do to make human space flight possible.  So, Adam, who is our first guest?    Adam Kalil:  First is Christine [inaudible].  She's the WD manager for Institutional Procurement Office and advisor for the ASIA employee resource group.  She also first came to the US as a refugee from Vietnam when she was 11.    Host:   Great.  All right, let's get right into it.  Producer Alex, cue the music.     [ Music ]    T minus five seconds and counting.  Mark.     [Inaudible] there she goes.    Houston, we have a podcast.     [ Music ]    Host:   Well, Christine, thank you for coming on the show to tell your story today.    Krystine Bui:   Thank you.  Happy to be here today.    Host:   [Laughs] Well, I wanted to start with -- and this is curious -- is you came to the United States from Vietnam, actually, when you were a kid.    Krystine Bui:   Mm-hmm.    Host:   So what was that like, that transition, I guess, from Vietnam to the States?    Krystine Bui:   Wow, I was 11 at the time, very, very young.  And I had a very traumatic experience coming over here on a boat.  I was one of the refugees, boat refugees.  Yeah.  We were stranded in the ocean for, like, 20 days without water or food.  So something like that you don't forget easily, even as a child.  So coming over here, everything was like new.  It was, like, a new land, a new beginning.  Everything was just totally strange and new.  We got a lot of help from church.  They gave us clothing and food in the beginning.  So, you know?    Host:   Yeah.    Krystine Bui:   I mean, I was too young to really comprehend and appreciate what all they were doing, but now looking back, yeah.    Host:   Yeah.    Krystine Bui:   All those amazing people.    Host:   Looking back at it objectively, it was just part of --    Krystine Bui:   Yeah, yeah.  I mean, looking back I told my kids every chance you get, \"You just need to give.  Because mom and dad came and we received.\"    Host:   Yes.  And it was very, very helpful.    Krystine Bui:   Yeah.    Host:   What were some of the things that were most new to you?  When you said things were new, was it a culture shock or was it, I don't know, maybe --    Krystine Bui:   Everything.    Host:   Everything?    Krystine Bui:   Yeah, I think we came in the winter.  So, you know, there's no winter in Vietnam -- at least South Vietnam there's no winter.  The temperatures there stays in I want to say the 90's year-round.  So coming over here, the first winter was -- you know, I mean, Houston wasn't cold, but then we were only here for a couple months.  And then we went on, we moved to Oklahoma City.  And Oklahoma City at the time had snow.    Host:   The first time seeing snow?    Krystine Bui:   Yeah, it was a true winter.  And at the time I didn't know how to wear tennis shoes, for instance.  And I still don't know how to wear tennis shoes to this day [Laughs] because I grew up in flip-flops.    Host:   Oh, I see.    Krystine Bui:   It was so funny.  You know, the church, they gave us shoes.  And my dad made us wear shoes to school.  But then halfway walking to school, I took off my tennis shoes and I put on my flip flops.     [ Laughter ]  Of course, in hindsight it wasn't, you know, a smart thing to do because I caught cold all winter long.    Host:   Oh, no.    Krystine Bui:   Yeah.    Host:   Yeah, I get why your body's not used to it.  And you're taking off your shoes.    Krystine Bui:   No.  So that was a total adjustment.  You know?  Just the temperature itself.  And then going to school, there was the language barrier, of course.    Host:   Oh, that's huge, yeah.    Krystine Bui:   But yeah, luckily when you're young, you're like a sponge and you absorb.  And, you know, you just learn.  You pick little things up here and there and eventually you blend in.    Host:   Okay.   Krystine Bui:   Yeah.    Host:   So you eventually felt that, you eventually felt like you sort of started to blend in a little bit?    Krystine Bui:   You know, I really didn't feel the transition; it just became part of my life.  You know?  I think when you're young and you're in a new culture, you just -- you just learn to adapt and you don't even think about it, you know?  Like, I think when you're older and you learn to play piano, anything, your mind has to make that transition, you know?  But the younger you are, the easier it is to adapt and adopt new things.  So I feel when you ask me when did I feel that transition, I really can't tell you.  It just became a part of me.  It just -- and I'm pretty sure it's like that for many people that came here when they were younger.    Host:   Yeah.    Krystine Bui:   Yeah.    Host:   In school, was there certain subjects that sort of clicked with you as you were going through this transitional period, maybe some things you really latched onto and really liked?  Maybe the education system really opened your eyes to some extra possibilities of what you wanted to do for the rest of your life.    Krystine Bui:   So I can tell you math was very easy for me [Laughs].    Host:   Really?    Krystine Bui:   And that's probably because of the school that I got in Vietnam.    Host:   Okay.    Krystine Bui:   So math was -- it was just easy.  And then English, of course, was not [Laughs].  I remember taking many ESL courses.    Host:   Mm-hmm.  English as a second language?    Krystine Bui:   Yeah, English as a second language.  And then I also had additional tutoring on the side to help me learn.    Host:   Okay.  So at what point did you decide -- because right now you're in accounting.  And I'm guessing that's kind of what you wanted to pursue for school, right?    Krystine Bui:   Not really.     [ Laughter ]    Host:   Was it forced upon you on your parents?    Krystine Bui:   So I'll tell you a little bit.  So, you know, Asian parents -- all Asian parents want their kids to be doctors.  And if you can't be a doctor, you be an engineer.  And if you can't be an engineer, I guess you go to business school [Laughs].  It's like the last one on the scale of things.  So, of course, I went down that path.    Host:   So was it you didn't want to be a doctor or an engineer?  Or is it --    Krystine Bui:   Well, you know what, I took one semester of biology at U of H Central Campus.  And I think there were at least 400 of us in that big, big auditorium.  It was so intimidating.  And me with my sleeping habit [Laughs], I didn't do well.    Host:   [Laughs] You fell asleep in class?    Krystine Bui:   I fell asleep in every single class.  And I still do to this day.  The minute people lecture, I go to sleep.    Host:   Oh.    Krystine Bui:   So then, of course, I switch over to engineering.  And I did really well in engineering.  And every class is -- because, you know, math was easy for me.  But then physics was absolutely not.  I took one physics class and I said, \"You know what?  I can't be an engineer.  I'm not a physics person.\"  So then at the time, my husband, my boyfriend then he said, \"Honey, why don't you just go for business?\"     [ Laughter ]  And, you know, so with my passion for number, accounting was the obvious choice.  So, yeah.    Host:   So when you started taking those classes, did you really start excelling?    Krystine Bui:   It was at home for me.    Host:   Really?    Krystine Bui:   Yeah, I slept through every single class and I aced all the way through.    Host:   Wow.    Krystine Bui:   Yeah.    Host:   So you knew, okay, that's definitely where you're excelling.  Because I couldn't do that.  I struggled through accounting, I really did.    Krystine Bui:   Oh, no.  It was a piece of cake for me.     [ Laughter ]    Host:   So then where did you start working right after school?    Krystine Bui:   So after I -- let's see, after I decided that accounting is my major, so then my friend got a job as a co-op out here.  He was an engineer co-op.  And then he started to tell me about NASA.  And I said, \"NASA, space exploration, those people up there in the sky?\"  I said, \"I want to be there, I think that's a cool place to be.\"    Host:   Yeah.    Krystine Bui:   So then I put in my application for a co-op.  When I put in, I had already missed the deadline for that semester.    Host:   Oh, no.    Krystine Bui:   But then you know what?  I really wanted to be here.  So I was on the phone bugging the co-op coordinator every day for, like, two weeks.  I said, \"You know, I really want to be out here.  And please, please, please give me an interview.\"  I think he was fed up with me after calling him two weeks straight [Laughs] and he told me to come in for an interview.    Host:   [Laughs] Finally gave in?    Krystine Bui:   Yeah.  And that's how I got my first co-op position out here.    Host:   Wow.  So where was the first position?  Was it --    Krystine Bui:   I was in FMD.    Host:   That's what?    Krystine Bui:   Financial Management Division.    Host:   Okay.    Krystine Bui:   That was where most accountants were at the time.  And so that was my first co-op tour.  And then the second co-op tour I decided I want to see what's beyond accounting.  So I went over to procurement.    Host:   Okay.    Krystine Bui:   And I don't know if it was necessarily the job in itself or the environment, the people that really attracted me and I felt more at home.  So after graduation I chose procurement, and I've been there ever since.    Host:   Really?    Krystine Bui:   Yes.    Host:   And I see not only have you been in procurement, but you sort of worked your way up through procurement.  Now you're a manager?    Krystine Bui:   Yes, yeah.    Host:   All right [Laughs].  So this is kind of a broad question, but maybe some people don't really recognize -- you think of NASA, you think of engineering, space flight, and science.  But there's a business side to things.    Krystine Bui:   Absolutely.    Host:   Someone's got to keep track of the numbers, right?  So what does the Procurement Office do?    Krystine Bui:   So, you know, the easiest way I explain to people is if you look around here, NASA, we don't do all the jobs ourselves.  You know, like the -- right now the International Space Station is floating out there in outer space.  We manage the contract, but the contractor that does -- the one that maintains the ISS is Boeing.    Host:   Hmm.    Krystine Bui:   And not only Boeing, but under Boeing they have quite a few major subcontractors and smaller subcontractors supporting them.  So, you know, on a high level it's like that.  But if you look around you, you know, let's say JSC buildings.  JSC employees, we don't quite maintain the buildings or we don't build the buildings.  Every time we get funding for a new building or to even do a roof repair, we get a contractor to come in and do the job.  And that's where procurement comes in.  We do everything from cradle to grave, from putting the request for proposal out to evaluate and award the contract to the contractors.  So that way they can come in and do the job.  We do a lot of -- NASA is -- NASA overall, we do more oversight than actual hands-on.    Host:   I see.  So you're awarded a certain amount of money, and you need a task.  And then your job is to make sure that that money is spent as efficiently as possible --    Krystine Bui:   Exactly.    Host:   -- bringing in the right people to do the right job.  It's done reliably, it's done based on a certain set of rules and requirements.    Krystine Bui:   Absolutely.    Host:   You have to make sure you fulfill these obligations.    Krystine Bui:   Before we pay them.    Host:   Yes.  Exactly.  Okay, so that makes sense.  So we are the -- we sort of -- we get the money and we make sure the job is done, but we enable these contractors to do that.    Krystine Bui:   Yes.  They carry out -- the contractor that has to carry out the requirements in the contract before we make any payment to them.    Host:   So then what's your job as a manager in the procurement office?  Are you delegating these responsibilities?     [ Laughter ]    Krystine Bui:   So as a manager, I have direct reports that are under me from team leads to contracting officers, to contract specialists.  So basically, all of us do the same kind of job but at a different level.  Like, the contract specialists, when you start out in procurement, you start out as a contract specialist.  And then after you've been there a while, you work your way up.  You understand the rules and regulations.  And then you become a contracting officer.  At that point, you review the work that the contract specialists do.  And then as the team lead, you know, you manage -- you oversee work that was done by these contracting officers and contract specialists.  And then as a manager, not only the -- not only you have the overall responsibility, but then you're also looking at a different side: You want to develop people's soft skills.    Host:   Yes.    Krystine Bui:   You want -- you know, you become more of a people developer, ensuring that you -- there is a succession pipeline that when you exit, when you leave, they will be behind you to pick up your job.  And not just to carry out the technical but also the softer people side as well.    Host:   Yeah, you're reviewing to make sure the job is done correctly but then also empowering others to develop their skills.    Krystine Bui:   Exactly.    Host:   So let's end with a piece of advice.  For you coming from Vietnam as a kid and just kind of learning the ropes for this brand new culture to now being a leader inside of NASA, what's a piece of advice that you would give someone outside?    Krystine Bui:   Whatever you do, just do your best.  Just approach it with passion.  And just be the best you can be.  And at the end of the day, you know, you alone cannot experience everything.  So look around for good mentors.  Look around for [inaudible] and go to them and get their help to fulfill your dream.  And as long as you have a dream, as long as you have your passion, anything is possible.    Host:   I love it.  Christine, thank you so much for coming on and sharing your story.    Krystine Bui:   Thank you.    Host:   Okay, that was Christine [inaudible] talking about her role in procurement and the ASIA ERG.  So, Adam, who do we have next?    Adam Kalil:   Next is Doug Wong.  He's the visiting vehicle SNMA integration lead for the International Space Station Cargo Resupply Service, CRS contract.    Host:   Wow.  All right.  He's got a big role.  And he actually came from Hong Kong, too.  It was really cool talk.  So let's go right ahead to there.  Doug, thank you so much for coming on the podcast today to share your story.    Doug Wong:  Thanks for having me.    Host:   Of course.  I wanted to start with your journey because yours is a unique one because you were an immigrant and you had -- actually were in Hong Kong for the first 19 years of your life, is that right?    Doug Wong:  Yeah, that's correct.  Yeah, I was an immigrant when I was 19 years old, and I spent most of my elementary and high school education in Hong Kong.  I, in fact, attribute a lot of my current career success to both my elementary school and my high school as well.    Host:   So have you ever seen, or visited, or maybe talked to an elementary school in the US and have a good comparison?    Doug Wong:  Yeah, I actually did get the chance to do that in one occasion.  And I was having a talk with some of the elementary school kids, I believe it was up in Woodlands, Texas, near Houston.  And, yeah, that was very interesting in that the kids, they were just so amazed at how -- you know, the way NASA operates all the futuristic things that we do.  And I actually can -- you know, when I was there, I could actually kind of see through their minds as to this kind of [inaudible] amazement out of their faces.  And it was just so fascinating.    Host:   Yeah.  Actually, so being in the Public Affairs Office, we go out and do stuff like that quite frequently actually.  And I always kind of purposely sign up for those things because sometimes you just kind of get into the groove of your day and you just sort of realize or you don't realize how special what you are doing is.  It's just the day-to-day job.  And then he quote you say, \"Well, this is what I'm doing,\" and then you see the kids faces light up and they're like, \"What?  You doing what?  That's amazing.  I didn't even know that was possible.\"  And you going to step back and realize how amazing it is.  So with your experience with talking with these students and maybe your experience with the school, how would you compare it to your education in Hong Kong?  What are some of the main differences?    Doug Wong:  Let me see.  Well, incidentally I also get the opportunity to visit my high school and also gave similar talks about my career, so I can actually tell the difference between them.    Host:   Oh, okay.    Doug Wong:  Kids in Asia, they tend to be a little bit more reserved.  And they don't necessarily express their feelings.  But once you start talking to them and once you get them up to speed, then they will have all kinds of questions.  I remember they loved asked me about astronomy, which is not actually a very good subject for me.  But I was still able to invoke their imagination, which was wonderful.  And in that respect it's kind of similar for the kids in the US in that they usually start -- become more excited, okay?  And they're all like, \"Wow, wow, engineers from NASA.  Cool.\"  That kind of expression you see from their face.  And then they will start having a lot of facial expressions, and you can tell that they are very, very engaged to your talk.    Host:   Yeah, and that's such a pleasure.  So one of the main differences since you -- so you were in school.  You were a student in Asian school, elementary schools, and you understand the cultural differences.  You know, what is it really that makes -- what are some of the cultural highlights that really point out why it's a little bit more reserved maybe than the excitement of a US school?    Doug Wong:  Yeah, I think a lot has to do with the cultural upbringing, especially the parenting.  Okay?  So when you're a kid -- an Asian kid -- you will be told not to speak up, okay, until you're told.    Host:   Oh.    Doug Wong:  Yeah, so this is something very different, unlike the kids over here.    Host:   They just speak up whenever they want.    Doug Wong:  Very open to, yeah, express themselves.  In fact, this is something that I have to learn through time to.    Host:   Oh, yeah?  Are you talking about even in the workplace, too, [inaudible] when to speak up?    Doug Wong:  Oh, yeah, absolutely.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah.    Host:   Oh, interesting.  So what was the -- I mean, coming here when you're 19, I mean, that's a pretty significant amount of time that you spent over in Hong Kong.  So I'm sure coming here as a teenager -- not even just a teenager.  I mean, you're almost in your 20s at this point.  How was the adjustment coming to the United States?    Doug Wong:  Well, it did take some getting used to.  Again, it's primarily the cultural issue.  I'm always a very quiet person.  Even now I'm a very quiet person.  But then after a time I learned that you really have to learn to express yourself, express how you feel, what your opinions are.  Otherwise people will see you as distant, not friendly, or in some cases just, you know, don't pay too much attention to you.  Okay?  So this is something I learned through time.  And that's also one of the reasons why now at NASA I try to -- in addition to my current work, I also tried to be involved in some of the employee resource group activities to try to help bring myself out.  I also see the need for myself to give back to the next generation.  So that becomes one of the things that I feel very passionate about.    Host:   Oh, that's fantastic.  Yeah.  I mean, even if you're a little bit more introverted and maybe you are a nice person and maybe you do care about other people, but maybe since it's not apparent, it's not perceived that way.  So you kind of actually have to force yourself to go on.  I mean, I did that.  That was college for me.  College was a brand-new experience, and so you kind of had to force yourself to go out and make friends and to join organizations that may be didn't know anyone, but you knew it was going to advance your career.  And maybe make a couple of friends along the way.  And actually, those friends are some of the closest I have right now and just because I decided at the time that I wanted to go out.  And I was nervous at first, I was really hesitant.  Maybe this is right for me.  It's kind of scary, but you got to go out and do it.    Doug Wong:  Yeah, I absolutely agree with you.  It's always very difficult when you first meet someone and try to talk to people.  But once you warm up and develop the relationship, you find it very beneficial.  This is something that time and time again I discovered.  So.    Host:   So I wanted to sort of get into your education, too, because it's all over the place.  You are -- I mean, honestly it makes me wanting back to school and get a couple more degrees and some letters at the end of my signature there.  But you had your hands in human factors, in the Constellation program, Orion.  So how did you transition from coming here at 19 to eventually working at NASA and then going around NASA and getting all of these different experiences?    Doug Wong:  Well, I think, again, school was a very important part of me.  And I remember -- I think my biggest motivation was there was one time after I came here, I watched a rerun of the Space Odyssey 2001 on TV.    Host:   Oh, yeah.    Doug Wong:  Man, that really inspired me.  I said, \"Oh wow.  I mean, this is something that -- I mean, [inaudible] near future, within my lifetime we can actually do these kind of things.\"  And then that fascinated me, and that kind of, like, started my career path.  So I decided to study mechanical engineering in school.  And I went to University of Maryland in College Park, and I got my BS degree around 1987.  And then I moved right ahead and got my master degree also in mechanical engineering in the same school.  And then right after that point I went straight to NASA.  At that time I went to NASA Langley Research Center because -- that was a different time, okay?  See, unlike right now, which [inaudible] you can get here is to go through the pathway program.    Host:   Right.    Doug Wong:  They were actually out there in my school trying to hire people.  And I got accepted.  It was, of course, very exciting.    Host:   Oh yeah.    Doug Wong:  And so I spent 16 years of my career at the NASA Langley Research Center, primarily doing a lot of research related activities.  And so that's when I started exposed to things like electronics and developing electronics for instrumentation for internals.  And then to human factors for aviation safety.  And that was extremely interesting, by the way, because it's like a video game, okay?  What we do was we developed these play systems with all kinds of symbology, which is unlike -- I mean, I should say which is very similar to the way people play video games, okay, that displays all different kinds of interesting icons.  So that was a very interesting experience for me.  And in fact, it touches a lot on safety-related issues.  And that sort of built up the foundation for me to develop an interest in human factors and safety.   So about 12 years ago I transferred over to Johnson Space Center.  So because of my background in that area I started working on the Constellation program and also the human research program and did a lot of human factors-related research.    Host:   So for those who may not know, human factors -- how does human factors relate to the engineering world?  Like, how would you define human factors?    Doug Wong:  Yeah.  See, a lot of times when you think about engineering, we're thinking about how the machine -- designing machines, how the machines work, right, the intricate parts of the machines.  But we often forgot a major part of any system is the human user, okay?  So a lot of times if you don't focus on that, we may develop something that is not to the liking of the user.  It can be difficult to use.  I'm sure sometimes you may have the experience of using a very difficult-to-use software.  You get so frustrated.  So that's where the human factors engineering comes in.  We try to make sure that the things that we develop have the user in mind.  The user should be the center of your design because this is the problem that you want to solve.  Right?  You want to help the human.    Host:   Which is -- I mean, that's the whole point of the human spaceflight, right?  You can design a system that works, that's robust, that's functional.  But if a human can't use it as easily as possible, then maybe it's not as efficient as possible or safe.  And that's where the safety comes in.    Doug Wong:  Yeah, that's part of the safety.    Host:   Yeah.  And that's where you are now, right?  Are you in safety and mission assurance?    Doug Wong:  Yeah, yeah.  I think it's kind of, like, a gradual evolution of my career path.  So now I'm in the safety area and actually involved in -- to make sure that the things that we design are safe enough for a human to use.    Host:   So how do you -- so what's your day-to-day stuff then?  In safety and mission assurance, what are you doing may be hands-on or otherwise to make sure that whatever component that you're focusing on -- and I think you're focusing on the Orbital ATK Cygnus, right, is that your focus?    Doug Wong:  Yes, that's correct.    Host:   So how is the safety and mission assurance component in the overall process of making sure that that vehicle is going to work safely with the ISS and for the crew?    Doug Wong:  Sure, yeah.  Just for those who may not know, so Orbital ATK is one of the commercial companies who are developing these space cargo vehicles and develop cargoes -- deliver cargoes up to the Space Station.  So a big part of it is to ensure that the cargo that we deliver up to the station is safe.  That has a lot of different aspects of it, one of them being the vehicle itself.  We make sure that the vehicle design is sound and that during its operation it won't have any hiccups, okay, for example, malfunctions.  Say the engine blows up, that's not a good thing.  Right?  When you're approaching the Space Station.  And even after the cargo vehicle is docked, what happens to the cargo inside?  What happens if we have some unsafe cargo that can cause harm to the crew?  So all these are things that we have to cover.   And once you're starting to depart, we also have to worry about the safety of the station.  Again, engine issue, okay?  If the engines fire too early, or misfire, something went wrong with the spaceship, then it affects the station.  So even though some people may say, \"This is just a cargo vehicle, why is safety so important?\"  But there are these kind of things you have to worry about.  Even when it's after orbiting, entering the atmosphere, that could be a potential hazard to people on the ground, too.    Host:   Yeah.    Doug Wong:  So all these are things that we have to think about.    Host:   And I think that's the important part, is it's the perspective that you're approaching it at.  So maybe another person is just worried about the cargo itself and making sure that it's snug and packed and it's going to work.  Another person's just concerned about the thrusters firing at the right time, at the right place, in the right direction.  But you have to come in and make sure that not only are they firing in the right direction, but they're going to do it in a safe manner to make sure that extra perspective is coming in.    Doug Wong:  That's correct.  Yeah, I think a lot of it has to do with my part in particular is to oversee all the -- the entire design of the vehicle.  Okay?  So some engineers, they might be focusing on designing just an engine part, for example.  They might overlook in some of the implication of the other side to the other portions.  And also to the safety of the crew, for example.  So all these are things that I need to look at from a bigger picture perspective to understand what kind of safety implications there are and make corrections to it.    Host:   So looking back at your education in Hong Kong, moving to your education here, and then you're career at NASA, what are some of the takeaways that really prepared you for doing what you're doing right now, especially in your education?    Doug Wong:  I think it's the fundamental understanding of some of the basic math and physics, any kind of science topic.  I have a very strong background in math and physics in particular.  So I'm so surprised, even nowadays I still use some of the concepts regularly.  In addition to my regular job, I consider myself an innovator.  And right now I'm actually trying to submit a proposal to develop a space nail clipping system in which -- see, in space, in the Space Station, because the crew stay there for a long time, their nails get long, okay?  And they need to cut their nails.    Host:   Oh, yeah.  One of those things.    Doug Wong:  Yeah.  But right now -- yeah, right now the way they do it, they just cut it right in front of a vent so a lot of the suction will suck it in, suck the nail clippings in.  But that's not a very safe way to do it, and some of the clippings can still airborne.  And they can cause, for example, injuries your eyes.  And nails may contain pathogens that will cause some disease.  So what I'm trying to do is develop an enclosed system that provides a suction.  So when the crew clip their nails, the nail clippings are automatically contained into the device.  So I'm doing all that.  So just incidentally this morning I was struggling with the physics of it.  I was trying to figure out what size of pumps do I need to use?  So all of a sudden, all the fundamental physics that I used to learn in high school all came back to me [Laughs].  Suddenly I just think, \"Wow, I'm in my 50's now and I'm still using the physics that I was taught when I was in high school.\"   So that's something eye-opening to me.    Host:   So when you go back to the schools, that's what you always usually say, is, \"I'm still using this, I still need it in my job right now.  So make sure you're paying attention in school right now.\"    Doug Wong:  Absolutely.    Host:   Yes.  I feel like that nail clipping thing can be useful for me at home.    Doug Wong:  Yeah, in fact, I'm trying to file a patent for it.  So I see that, for example, people with disability, they will be able to make use of something like that so that they don't have to keep worrying about the clippings flying all over the place.  Instead they just go all right into the device.    Host:   All right.  Well, Doug, thank you for your contributions to NASA and for your innovations, coming here and making a difference.  So thank you for coming on the podcast and telling your story.    Doug Wong:  Thank you very much.  I really appreciate this opportunity.    Host:   And that was Doug talking about his journey from Hong Kong to a leader and inventor.  So, Adam, who do we have next?    Adam Kalil:  Next is Charlene Gilbert.  She's a technology transfer officer in the Exploration Technology Office.    Host:   Interesting title and interesting job.  So here we go, jumping right ahead to that talk.  Well, Charlene, thank you so much for coming on the podcast today to tell us your story.    Charlene Gilbert:  Thanks.    Host:   So I wanted to start with just growing up and just getting into STEM.  Because you went for a math and statistics bachelor's first.  And that's not something that I would personally opt for [Laughs].    Charlene Gilbert:  So I grew up in a really small town in upper Michigan -- Marquette, Michigan.  Had a liberal arts university there.  But a lot of the people that I went to school with don't go on to college.  It's not typical.  But my mother is Japanese and my father was a GI that she met during the Korean War.  And then she came to this country in 1954, along with two of my brothers that had been born in Japan.  And both of my parents were very adamant that all the kids were going to college, even though we didn't have any money.  It didn't make any difference, right?  So the thought of you better get a scholarship started really early.  So when I was in probably sixth grade, seventh grade, that was -- my mom was really adamant that you need to study hard and work hard because scholarship's the way you're going to college.   And we all worked to pay for college.  We got scholarships.  We borrowed money.  But that was -- that was the path that we were all on.  So I had two brothers and one sister.  And both brothers and myself went to college.  And so it was not even debatable; it was just that's where you were going.     [ Laughter ]  But I always liked science a lot and math a lot when I was in school.  And back in those days, young ladies weren't really encouraged to pursue the hard sciences.  Right?  So first of all, people weren't going to college.  They're not encouraged to go to college very much.  And then the young ladies aren't really encouraged to go into any of the STEM courses, right?    Host:   So you did the opposite, then?    Charlene Gilbert:  Yeah, well.     [ Laughter ]  So and I think we only had one or widow young ladies that went after an engineering degree in my graduating class of 400.  And but for myself, I started in a field of biology because I just really loved it.    Host:   Oh, yeah.    Charlene Gilbert:  And I got into it, and then I realized that with a bachelor's degree you weren't going to make very much money.  So what's required with a bachelor's is you have to go on for master's and PhD.  And it seemed like a really, really long road.  And so I thought -- and, you know, again, we were working, everybody in my family working, borrowing money, and scholarships.    Host:   Yes.    Charlene Gilbert:  So you're thinking about what can I do for a bachelor's, right, that's going to be meaningful and something I really want to pursue?  And I've always really, really loved puzzles.  And so I looked and I decided to change my degree over to math and statistics.  And it's applied statistics.  So it was in the line of market research, doing sample surveys, and doing analysis on data, right?  So that's always something that I've enjoyed.  And I thought, \"Okay, well, I can do that.\"  And I set off on that path.  And my plan was to get a master's degree.  But when arrived here and I started working in the fields that I was in, I realized that I didn't need more detail in statistics; I needed a broader background in other areas.  And so I pursued a space science degree at the University of Clear Lake.    Host:   So you went -- you had your bachelor's and through your bachelor's came to NASA first before realizing, \"I should go back and learn more about space?\"    Charlene Gilbert:  Right.    Host:   So how did you transfer from this math background to realizing that NASA was an opportunity?    Charlene Gilbert:  Well, so we -- the class of people in the math department was pretty small.  So there was some classes where we filled the first row of seats in the class.  That was how small it was.  But a friend of mine was able to take a vacation after she graduated.  The rest of us were looking for jobs [Laughs] and she took a vacation in Florida, saw a big ad that Ford Aerospace was hiring at the Kennedy Space Center.  So she applied.  And then they said, \"Well, we don't have any positions there, but we've got a new contract in Houston.  Space Shuttle's just starting up.  And would you be interested?\"  So she came here, and then they said, \"Do you have any more friends?  Because we need to hire more people.\"  So she called all of us.  And she called me and said, \"What are you doing?\"  And I had been working at an insurance company, doing statistical analysis for them.   So I told her.  And then I said, \"Well, what are you doing?\"  And she said, \"Well, I'm working on the Space Shuttle program.\"  Really?  So it went on from there, and she talked me into coming for an interview.  And I came down here, and they hired me.  And I packed everything up in my little car and drove down here.  And people were shocked.  They said, you know, \"Do you know anybody?  Do you have family?\"  I said, \"Well, I have one friend down here,\" and I showed up.    Host:   You didn't want to pass that opportunity up?    Charlene Gilbert:  Well, no, right?  I mean, working at the insurance company or working on the Shuttle program, right?  But the other thing is when I got down here, I realized that everybody comes from other places.    Host:   Right.    Charlene Gilbert:  So a lot of folks showed up with no friends, right?  So there were a lot of us that had come from different areas.  And we -- we formed friendships.  And we had a lot of social activity.  And now it's, you know, it's home.    Host:   Yeah.  No, I totally get that.  I came here as a co-op student myself and it was the same thing.    Charlene Gilbert:  Right.    Host:   You know, it was a brand-new opportunity far away from home.  Parents were just like, \"That's a little far.\"  But I was like, \"I don't want to miss out on this.\"  So, you know, I came down here.  But so did a lot of other students my age with the same goal in mind.  And then we all just became friends, and we're still friends to this day.  So you kind -- it's funny, because you think you're going to be alone, but then you just develop this community because there's a lot of other people in the same boat.    Charlene Gilbert:  We had some really interesting Thanksgiving dinners, you know, with mixed cultures and these are my favorite foods.    Host:   Oh, yeah.  We have that, too.  Friends-giving is what we call it [Laughs].  All right.  So you were working for Ford Aerospace first.  And then McDonell Douglas shortly after that, was that the order?    Charlene Gilbert:  Right, right.  McDonnell Douglas was quite the engineering company here.  And then after -- afterwards, Boeing ended up buying McDonnell Douglas.  And so both Ford Aerospace was sold, McDonnell Douglas was sold as all the companies began to merge together.    Host:   Right.    Charlene Gilbert:  So but while I was working for Ford Aerospace and when I worked for Ford, I worked in Building 30 and then Mission Control Center.  My job was working and doing software development, and software tests, and software maintenance.  And it was in the trajectory and logic, which is the mathematics that makes the ground computers work right.    Host:   So you weren't necessarily sitting on console, doing the trajectory; you were making the magic happen so that that person knew they had good software.    Charlene Gilbert:  We had a dual job.  So our job was to sit in the back room, support the FIDO, and track and dynamics.  And then also when you weren't doing that shift, you're in the office, trying to fix the software to make the computer work.  And back then they had the really big mainframes.  And so it was a lot more challenging.    Host:   Yeah, I can imagine.  So first you started off in operations, and then I guess you stuck around at Johnson Space Center.  Right?  So kind of --    Charlene Gilbert:  So then I had a chance to go over.  My friend again [Laughs] moved, and she got me started in the track and dynamics area.  And then she jumped to McDonnell Douglas, working in the payloads area.  And she got me to move over.  And so I followed her over there and I was working on attached payloads and Spacelab.  And so that went on for a while.  And then there was a big contract change and McDonnell Douglas didn't win the contract.  So pretty soon, you know, the choice was either to move to the new contract or find employment elsewhere.  And I really wanted to stay here, but I was not really keen on moving to the new contract.  And then I was fortunate, the civil servants NASA group that I had worked with before in Building 30 had an opening and they were able to hire.  And so I was able to come on board.    Host:   All right.    Charlene Gilbert:  Right back where I started doing the track and dynamics kind of work.  So.    Host:   And then being civil servant, that's when you started moving -- throughout your whole career moved around.  And you had your fingers in a lot of different areas, including the one that I really wanted to highlight is your position now.  You're a technology transfer officer.  That's interesting.  So what do they do?    Charlene Gilbert:  Well, so federal law says it's our responsibility to transfer the technology and research results from federal funding, right, out into the public for economic growth, economic benefit, economic security.  So each of the NASA field centers has a technology transfer officer.  Actually, all of the federal labs are required to have a technology transfer officer.  And their job is to ensure that they are compliant with tech transfer and try to the best of their ability to make it happen.    Host:   It's a very -- I guess it's a process to actually take the technology that we develop at NASA and, correct me if I'm wrong, give it to the private industry.    Charlene Gilbert:  Right.    Host:   Give it to private industry.    Charlene Gilbert:  So it's not like you put it in a bucket and you give to them, right?    Host:   Yeah.    Charlene Gilbert:  So there's a lot of steps they have to go through to make sure that it's appropriate, right?  But some of the technology ends up in patents, which are licensed by companies that are looking to either improve their business or start a business, right?  So people say, \"Well, why don't you just give it away?\"  Well, if -- there's no competitive edge when you have something that everybody else has.    Host:   Right.    Charlene Gilbert:  So a license to a patent gives you the ability to use that patent and can exclude others.  It depends what type of license you have.  You can have an exclusive license, which means nobody else can use that patent and you're the only one -- that's the strongest competitive edge that you would have, right?    Host:   Right.    Charlene Gilbert:  But we also have software that is developed here that is unique.  We do a lot of analysis and special software tools that we have.  And those are also made available to the public for their use.    Host:   All right.  So I'm sure you've worked with a lot of different technologies, especially in the transfer as an officer, but what's one that you really, really like to highlight, say this has been one that you really like to showboat sort of?    Charlene Gilbert:  Well, I think the Bigelow inflatable structures is probably the one that is probably very well known and we're really proud of.    Host:   Yeah.  Yeah, that's a good story, too, because it's a technology that we developed here, but now it's -- I mean, you're talking about the Bigelow expandable activity module?    Charlene Gilbert:  Right.    Host:   We've actually talked about it before on this podcast, which is great, but I mean, didn't really realize or didn't really address that it was a technology transfer, that we're taking this technology and working with -- it was Bigelow's company, right?    Charlene Gilbert:  Right    Host:   And now we have actual hardware that has been tested on the International Space Station.  And last I heard it's going to stay there.    Charlene Gilbert:  Yes, right?  And so the next step after that would be -- he's a very shrewd businessman, right?  He has a very long-term vision.    Host:   Oh, yeah.    Charlene Gilbert:  And he has always talked about creating private structures, right?  It may be a private Space Station, it might be a hotel for tourism.  But his thought in the very beginning was to create a new, new industry structure for the United States -- a manufacturing capability.  So he's always had a really long-range vision, which I think really gave us confidence in licensing this technology to him that he was going to take it and make something of it that turns into a commercial venture, right?  But all along the way, right, he created this aerospace company, Bigelow Aerospace Company.  He made tremendous financial investment in the north Las Vegas area.  So jobs were being created and products were being created.   And new knowledge was being created.    Host:   Wow, shows the real potential of a piece of technology that, handed over to private industry, now it's becoming -- it's real.  It's a real piece of technology.  A lot of the people work on it, right?  And it's for developing the space business, I guess.  That's a fantastic concept.    Charlene Gilbert:  Yes.    Host:   Well, Charlene, thank you so much for coming on, and telling your story, and giving us a little bit of insight into this wonderful world of technology transfer.    Charlene Gilbert:  All right.  Glad to be here.  Thank you.    Host:   Of course.  Okay, that was Charlene Gilbert talking about her journey to her current role in exploration technology as a technology transfer officer.  It's a pretty cool job.  So one more to go.  Who is our last guest?    Adam Kalil:  Okay, Gary.  Last is Ven Fang [assumed spelling].  He's the manager of the International Space Station Transportation Integration Office, meaning he's in charge of the integration and verification of all the vehicles that visit the Space Station -- the cargo vehicles like Orbital ATK Cygnus and SpaceX Dragon, the international partners' vehicles like the Russian Soyuz and the Japanese HTV, and soon the commercial crew vehicles from Boeing and SpaceX.    Host:   Yeah, it's not like he's looking after one thing; he looks after all of those things.  It's a pretty cool job.  So Producer Alex, let's do that final warp to that final talk.  Ven, thank you so much for coming on the podcast today to tell us your story.    Ven Fang:  It's a real pleasure being here.  Thanks for the invitation.    Host:   Of course.  I kind of wanted to start with -- as I've been doing with all the other guests so far -- is just how it all began, especially when you got interested in STEM and when you grew up and got interested in science technology.    Ven Fang:  Sure, sure.  I'd say when I was very young.  So I grew up in northern Alabama where the skies were very dark at night, and my father and my sister and I would lay outside on the hills at night.  And we would watch the stars.  So my dream and aspiration every since I was a small kid was to be an astronomer or maybe travel there myself as an astronaut.  And this was in the late '60s.  So, of course, it was in the news a lot.  So for me at that time science fiction and science were sort of blended.  And I always sort of thought or knew maybe early on that I wanted to go into a STEM field.    Host:   So were you, like, a Trekkie fan or anything like that?  Or mainly just looking at the stars, telescopes or anything?    Ven Fang:  Oh, absolutely.  I could name the title of every Star Trek show --    Host:   Oh, really?    Ven Fang:  -- within about 20 seconds of it starting when I was a kid.    Host:   Wow, now that's a fan.  Okay.  Very cool.  So then at what point did you decide, you know, through your childhood really looking at the science fiction, especially with Star Trek, but then realizing that maybe STEM was a field that you really wanted to pursue?    Ven Fang:  You know, I really had very broad interests.  You know, as a kid I was always very interested in math and science.  I also liked sports.  For a long time I thought I would go into business but I would go into a business that would help me -- that would use my math and science background to, you know, further myself in some sort of type of business or in some other commercial venture.  And I think that combination really sort of led me to where I am now, which was here at NASA but helping with commercial partners for the commercial resupply missions and for commercial crew coming up here in the future as well.    Host:   Yeah, that's right.  Because your job position now is working with those companies, right, with a lot of them?    Ven Fang:  Yeah, that's right.  Yeah, that's right.  So I've worked -- in the past I've worked Space Shuttle and Spacelab.  And I've been with the Space Station program now for sometime.  In my current job I'm helping with the fleet of spacecraft that come to and from the Space Station.  And, of course, they have a fleet of five now, including two US vehicles, as well as two vehicles from Russia and one from Japan.  But we have two more on the horizon here in the next year or so.  And then we have another US commercial crew vehicle, a commercial cargo vehicle coming a few years down the line, and another Japanese one in the future.  So we're going to be taking our fleet of five spacecraft today and expanding those as they come to and from the Space Station in the coming years.    Host:   So what are the five that you're working with right now, then?    Ven Fang:  Let's see.  Today we're working with the US vehicles, our Orbital ATK Cygnus and the SpaceX Dragon.  With the Russians we have the Russian Progress and Soyuz.  And with the Japanese partners we have the HTV -- H-II Transfer Vehicle.    Host:   Okay.  So those are all cargo.  These are all cargo vehicles.    Ven Fang:  Yeah, with the exception of the Russian Soyuz [inaudible].    Host:   And the Soyuz, right.  Okay.  So then -- yeah, besides the Soyuz, all of these different companies are developing these cargo vehicles to work with one vehicle, right, the International Space Station.  So is that where you come in with you are working to make sure that, you know, these companies are going to be able to -- when they create these unique vehicles, it's going to work with the Space Station?    Ven Fang:  Absolutely right.  So there's so many factors that go into how do you launch a spacecraft from the planet, catch it up to the Space Station traveling at 17,500 miles per hour orbiting the planet, and then have it close to a very safe distance, and then ultimately come up and either birth or dock to the Space Station?  So we help, and there's so many aspects that.  There's guidance, navigation, and control.  There's structural systems, thermal systems, life support systems, and so forth.  So there's just a lot of different aspects that my group, my team helps to look at to make sure that they can come up both safely and operate with a high probability of mission success.    Host:   So you think you have -- is it a fairly large team or is it a small group of people that are working with all these different companies?    Ven Fang:  Let's see, our Transportation Integration Office, we typically staff between two to three people -- persons -- person vehicle.  But, of course, we're relying on a huge team of folks from engineering and each of the engineering disciplines, from operations, from safety, cargo integration, and so forth.  So there's really quite a pretty extensive team.  So we've got a small team that's helping to do the integration of the contract management of those vehicles or the international partner integration.  And then but we really rely on a lot of experts in a lot of areas as well.    Host:   That's right.  So your team is sort of -- I guess you are going to make sure that you are, I guess -- in the Transportation Integration Office, you're mainly getting all these components together.  Is that your role, then, making sure everybody's working together and executing this to make sure it happens?    Ven Fang:  That's absolutely right.  So we've got the technical integration, there's a schedule integration.  There's also, you know, there's -- any spacecraft integration is difficult, right?  Working with all the various launch vehicles, as well as the spacecraft, there can be risks as well -- risk from a cost perspective, from schedules, as well as from a technical.  So we really make sure that we mitigate all of those to whether or not elevated risk many of those areas.  But if they are, then we make sure that we inform our program manager and headquarters up the line in case there are any remaining risks so that as a nation we can go forward and decide eyes wide open do we want do proceed with this particular mission or this particular configuration?    Host:   Wow.  Okay.  So you're just keeping track of everything and making sure when it comes down to the mission, everything's going to work, really.    Ven Fang:  Mm-hmm.    Host:   How is it with working with so many companies, then?  Because I'm sure that each one is different in its own way.  So it's not like you can apply the same sort of -- maybe you do apply mainly the same rules, but it must be different working with each one.    Ven Fang:  It is.  Every single one is different.  Just like every individual is different, every team and every company or every international partner has its own culture and blending of individuals, right?  And they've all come to us not only from a different culture but from a different spacecraft heritage, right?  So it is very different working.  And it's funny.  As just one example of that, if I have -- we work with several different contractors as I mentioned before.  So we work with Orbital ATK, we work with SpaceX, we work with Sierra Nevada.  And each of those companies has its own sort of culture.  But if I go -- I'm off on business trips and when I go and I'll pack, I'll literally have to pack -- not have to pack -- I'll choose to pack different sets of clothing essentially for each of those places.  Because the culture in each of these industries and each of those companies is different from company to company.  And that's just a very minor example of they're just different.  They come from different heritages, and they have different perspectives on things.  But they're all based in the same set of requirements that we laid on each of those US contractors.   It's a document called SSP50808.  And it defines, it aggregates all those things that we learned from the Shuttle program, from Station side of the interface, and really have their heritage from the very early Apollo, Gemini, and Mercury programs as well.  And we put those all into one book and given those to industry.  And that's what they're building their vehicles to -- the interface of their vehicles to.    Host:   I see.  So it's essentially create your own identity, do what you think is best; but whatever you do, it has to fit these requirements.  You have to make sure you're playing by these rules.  Otherwise it's not going to work.  We're not going to be able to play ball, I guess.    Ven Fang:  Yep, that's correct.  So you can see the vehicles and just from their physical appearance, you can see they're very different vehicles.  But when they comes to Station, they all have to match up perfectly.    Host:   Yeah.    Ven Fang:  Even in the early days of Space Station there was a lot of the discussion, \"Well, are we going to do things in English units of measure or in metric?\"    Host:   Oh, yeah.    Ven Fang:  And even then once we selected metric, once you look at metric, there's actually different standards for metric as well.  So once you get out there four or five decimal places, there can be small differences, which can then end up making differences in making sure everything connects correctly up on orbit.    Host:   Oh, wow.  Even the units that you're using can translate.  Now, that's just talking about cargo vehicles.  But you are already talking about looking forward at commercial crew.  Now, I'm sure that's going to be -- it's going to be a challenge of its own.  Because now you're not just dealing with just equipment; now you're dealing with people.  So is that a little bit harder of a world because -- is there extra constraints?    Ven Fang:  There absolutely are.  We look at things from having humans on board, there's going to be a different set of interfaces and controls that are in place for human-rated systems.  Now, these cargo vehicles still have human interfaces as in they go to Station, they become attached, and our crew members go in and out of them.  So they also have to adhere to human-rating standards.  But with the commercial crew vehicles, absolutely.  If we're going to have people on board for the time it takes to get on orbit and perhaps at any -- if there's cases where they may stay longer on orbit inside that vehicle, there's going to be accommodations for those humans as well.  So absolutely, we have to consider all those aspects.    Host:   It's just amazing, the broad scope of things that you and your team really have to manage.  And you're the manager of this group, right?  The Transportation Integration Office.  So and you've had quite a career at NASA in various aspects.  You were a programmer, instructor for flight controller, working in payloads, working in avionics.  You were kind of all over the place but eventually got to this management position.  And so what did you have to do and what were your goals to sort of work up the ladder and really hone your skills into management to look at something so broad?    Ven Fang:  That's interesting.  I -- I think my overall guiding principles, I always wanted to do something that made a difference beyond myself for a longer period, you know, perhaps hundreds or an even longer horizon.  And for me, when I looked around after college, a lot of friends of mine as we were going through college went to work in different industries.  And when I really took a look around and as I was within a couple years of graduation, really deciding which way I'm going to funnel my efforts in the future, really discerned that space flight is really where I wanted to be.  And smaller and even more targeted than that, human space flight.  And then so when I looked around, it really became the center -- Johnson Space Center, which is what really interested me.  So once I got here, as quickly as I could, I went to go work for the Space Shuttle and Spacelab programs.  And from there, within the overall broad umbrella of I want to do things that make a difference, I looked at what those things were that really interested me.  So at the time Space Shuttle -- of course, I grew up just watching every Space Shuttle launch.   And Space Station was the next new thing that I really wanted to contribute to and be a part of.  So I came to Space Station.  Within Space Station it's been a wonderful career being able to try different areas.  So I've got to go through quite a number of different areas and work in a lot of different areas.  And I think really that desire to do that as well as a lot of the opportunities and a lot of great folks I've worked with and for in the past really enabled me to try a lot of different areas and really sort of culminated in the ability to be able to do this integration job where I can look across many different systems and subsystems and really apply things that I learned in the past to our next generation of vehicles.    Host:   Yeah.  Now, besides the broad scope of technical expertise that you've acquired over the years, there's also this idea of managing people and getting everyone to work together and enjoy the jobs that they're doing and make sure that all of these requirements are being filled.  So how do you as a manager make sure that all of this is being done and in the most fluid and efficient manner possible?    Ven Fang:  I'd say it really -- there is no single way [Laughs].  Right?  I think the most important overarching thing is to align the organizational needs with the individuals' goals as well.  And that way what individuals want to do, if you can put them in the right positions that help further their goals at the same time as furthering the organization's goals, then everybody's happy.    Host:   Yeah.    Ven Fang:  I also try to provide near real-time feedback -- in public if it's praise; and in private if it's an opportunity for improvement.  And then I also try to recognize folks.  I think everybody has a different way in which or different ways in which they like to be recognized.  Some like public recognition.  Some may like an on-the-spot award.  Some may want a time-off award in order to go spend more time with their family.  Others may want those plum assignments and they're just -- they just constantly want more and more.  And if they get those big media assignments, that really invigorates them.  So really just trying to align what the organization needs to get done with what each individual really -- what really excites them.    Host:   I love it.  So looking forward to the future, you have all these different vehicles that you're working with and working with businesses here in the US but also international partners.  There's a lot going on and a lot going on in the future; what's the thing you're looking forward to most?    Ven Fang:  Gosh, I think we're at a real -- you know, it was very interesting.  Just a few years ago with the transition from the old previous program called Constellation, then retirement of the Space Shuttle, you know, NASA sort of came to an end of the Shuttle chapter.  And then that was a time where there was a little question about, you know, what's really the next step?  And I think it's really exciting now because I think you see a lot of public interest, commercial interest, international interest, political interest in space.  And there's a lot of exciting things going on right now.  On the Space Station we've really hit our groove.  And I think that we are doing so many interesting scientific experiments onboard Space Station.  We have commercial industry participating.  I would say seven or eight years ago, we weren't sure that commercial industry on a firm fixed-price basis could develop new rockets and new spacecraft and resupply the Space Station.  On an international front, we've been working with these 15 countries on the International Space Station for -- this year it will be 20 years, which is a pretty amazing thing, given all the things that are happening or have happened on the planet over the last 20 years.   And in many other areas, diplomatically, militarily some of those countries weren't always best of friends, but on the Space Station I would say that we have always, without an exception, pulled together to make sure that we did the right things for the crew and for the vehicle and for the partnership.    Host:   That's wonderful.  Just laying it out like that, that's such a nice -- like, that's such a nice overview of just the state that we are right now, looking backwards but then also looking forwards to say just based on looking at this environment that we're working in right now, there's so much that can still happen.  And there's so many different ways to grow.  So thank you, Ven, for coming on and telling your story and kind of giving us this broad perspective of Space Station and what's to come.    Ven Fang:  Great.  Thank you very much for the opportunity.  I appreciate it.    Host:   Well, Adam, that wraps up our guests for this episode.  Thanks for helping to get these incredible people to come on and tell their stories.    Adam Kalil:  Sure, my pleasure.  I'm glad to be here, Gary.  And thank you for this great show and for this great opportunity to share and know our co-workers in the workforce.    Host:   Oh, I was really happy to do it.  They were -- honestly, it was really a pleasure to talk to each and every one of them.  They have interesting stories and interesting jobs, too.  Really, I mean, they do a lot of important stuff.  I just love talking to all of these great people.  So if you want to know -- if you want to learn more from other great people, you can listen to other episodes of this podcast.  This was episode 46.  But really, you don't really need to listen to them in any particular order.  You can just go back and listen to any one.  And there's some great stories.  I would definitely recommend listening to Stories of Her Strength from Women's History Month and African-American History Month episodes also -- really good podcasts and really good guests that we have there.  Otherwise you can listen to some of our friends over at other centers.  NASA in Silicon Valley over at Ames Research Center has a podcast.  And then Gravity Assists is the podcast over at headquarters hosted by Dr. Jim Green to talk about planetary science.  Otherwise you can follow the NASA Johnson Space Center on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram.  And use the hashtag #askNASA to ask a question or maybe suggest an episode for a future talk where we can bring in guests and tell more stories.   Just be sure to mention it's for Houston, We Have a Podcast.  So this podcast, this episode was recorded all through the month of May 2018 thanks to Alex Perryman, Kelly Humphries, Pat Ryan, Bill Stafford, and, of course, to Adam here for helping to bring it all together.  Thank you, Adam.    Adam Kalil:  Sure, thanks.    Host:   And thanks again to all of our guest for coming today on this show – Krystine Bui, Doug Wong, Charlene Gilbert, and Ven Fang.  Happy Asian-Pacific American Heritage Month.  We'll be back next week.     [ Music ]    Houston, go ahead.    of the Space Shuttle.    Roger, zero G and I feel fine.    Shuttle has cleared the [inaudible].    We came in peace for all mankind.    It's actually a huge honor to break a record like this.    Not because they are easy but because they are hard.   Houston, welcome to space."

                        "description": "Gary Jordan (Host):  Houston, we have a podcast.  Welcome to the official podcast of the NASA Johnson Space Center, episode 48, Moon Rocks.  I'm Gary Jordan and I'll be your host today.  So, in this podcast, we bring in the experts, NASA scientists, engineers, astronauts, all to let you know the coolest information about what's going on right here at NASA.  So, today, we're talking to the keeper of all moon rocks in the world, Ryan Zeigler.  Well, technically, they're all held here at the Johnson Space Center by NASA in the Lunar Curation Facility.  But Ryan is the lunar sample curator here in Texas and he's also a planetary scientist.  We had a great discussion about moon rocks, like the reason why we brought them back from moon during the Apollo Program, more about the facilities that keep them, and also what we're still learning from them.  So, with no further delay, let's go lightspeed and jump right ahead to our talk with Dr. Ryan Zeigler.  Enjoy.    [ Music ]    Host:   Ryan, thanks for taking the time to come on the podcast today.  I can't believe it, but we're actually finally going to talk about moon rocks.    Ryan Zeigler:  I know, I mean you'd think this was a cursed subject or something.    Host:  Well, it's interesting because -- and correct me if I'm wrong -- all of the moon rocks that were collected on the Apollo missions are here, correct?    Ryan Zeigler:  Most of our here, about -- about 85% are here or maybe 80% are here, 5% are out with scientists, and about 15% are at a secret remote storage facility at White Sands, so --    Host:  Oh, okay.    Ryan Zeigler:  Not that secret, I guess, so.    Host:  The secret's out now.  Okay.  So -- but -- but the moon rocks were collected on just human missions, right, not robotic missions?    Ryan Zeigler:  For NASA, yes.    Host:  Okay.  Okay.  So, were there other lunar acquisition -- like robotic ones?    Ryan Zeigler:  Yeah, so the Soviets had three Luna missions -- Luna 16, 20, and 24, and they collected about a pound of samples.    Host:  Oh, really?    Ryan Zeigler:  Yeah.  Yeah.    Host:  Robotically?    Ryan Zeigler:  Robotically, yup.    Host:  Okay.  Very cool.  Must have been a different profile.  But we went a couple times, right?  We did -- we did Apollo, you know, 11 through 17.    Ryan Zeigler:  Yeah.  We had six missions that landed on the surface.    Host:  Exactly.  All right, a lot of moon rocks.  So.  So, let's talk about moon rocks, themselves, because, you know, how I imagine it is just, you know, gray rocks.  But I'm sure -- and I'm sure as -- from a geologist's perspective, there are interesting ones and there are -- there are not so interesting ones.  And there was -- there was just some decision-making that went with the acquisition of them.    Ryan Zeigler:  No, absolutely.  And you're right, though.  If you look at moon rocks, most of them are kind of boring to look at.  I mean they have a bit of an image problem.  Most of them are sort of gray rocks but there's a few things about them that really set them apart.  They're really old.  They formed on a body with no atmosphere, so there's a lot of micrometeorite impacts into them.  There's a lot of things that set them apart from Apollo's -- from terrestrial samples.  And so, they are really interesting to scientists for a lot of those reasons, yeah.    Host:  For sure, definitely.  So, some of the first ones were collected from NASA on Apollo 11, right?    Ryan Zeigler:  Yes.    Host:  Awesome.  So, how much -- do you know how much they collected?    Ryan Zeigler:  It's about 25 kilograms, so about -- a little over 50 pounds.    Host:  All right.    Ryan Zeigler:  Yeah.    Host:  But I guess it felt different when they were actually collecting it.    Ryan Zeigler:  Well 1/6 as much.  Yeah.  I know.  I mean everyone was super strong on the moon and it was great.  You could jump super high, except for the spacesuits, I think.    Host:  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  So, what did they used to collect it?  Was it kind of bending over and picking it up or was it --    Ryan Zeigler:  Well, they couldn't bend over very well and that was good for us because that kept them from touching them with their gloved hands because the gloves were a source of contamination.  So, they had specially designed tools made out of either stainless steel or aluminum.  And so, they -- like, basically one of those long claw things you see that -- like the t-rex with the two claw things, that's kind of like that, only NASA, so it was made of steel.    Host:  Okay.    Ryan Zeigler:  And then they had sieves and they had some rakes.  And so, they had a couple different instruments -- tools to help them collect them.    Host:  Okay.  And that was all planned ahead of time.  They knew that the -- did they understand the surface of the moon before they went?    Ryan Zeigler:  They understood it pretty well.  What they didn't -- they underestimated how important the impacts were on the surface.  And on Earth, impacts are a relatively minor thing because we've got an atmosphere.  So, you see shooting stars at night and that's little sand sized stuff being burned up.  On the moon, all of that stuff, it's the moon going several kilometers per second.  So, it's a much finer grained place and there's just -- yeah.  So, the tools they use evolved over time.  On Apollo 11, they had one set.  And by Apollo 17, they had a much more evolved set.  They learn from being there and sort of redesigned them on the fly, so to speak.    Host:  Okay.  That makes sense.  You go on the surface and you have people actually using the tools and then providing real-time feedback.    Ryan Zeigler:  Exactly.    Host:  Hey, this worked, this didn't.  I need this bigger, this smaller, this longer, whatever, so.  Okay, that makes a lot of sense.  So, when they collected them, what was that process like?  Did they kind of put it into bags and seal them up or was it like a bin?    Ryan Zeigler:  On Apollo 11 especially, because they didn't collect that many rocks, I mean 50 pounds sounds like a lot, but rocks are heavy.  So, they had a special box with a metal-on-metal knife edge seal that allowed them to seal them away.  And so, they would collect them with the tool, put it inside a Teflon bag, roll up the bag, and then the bag would go in the box.    Host:  Okay.    Ryan Zeigler:  And then at the end of Apollo 11, just before they were sealing them up to put them inside, Neil Armstrong looked at it and thought that the box looked kind of empty, so he got his shovel out and literally just shoveled a bunch of dirt into the box around all of the other samples.    Host:  Really?    Ryan Zeigler:  It's -- almost as an afterthought.  And it ended up being like 11 kilograms or something.  And it being almost a quarter of the sample they brought back.    Host:  Whoa.    Ryan Zeigler:  And it ended up being the largest single sample from Apollo 11 and probably one of the most important.  And it was just -- he just looked at it and thought, this is silly, I'm going to go all the way to the moon and I'm going to bring back a half-full box of rocks.  So, he shoveled some dirt in, sealed it up, and that came back.  On later mission, when they started collecting more rocks and would fit in the rock boxes, some of them came back just in the Teflon bags, sealed up tight, like cookies or coffee or something.  But those probably saw a little bit of atmosphere.    Host:  Oh, okay.  So, the idea was to protect it from the Earth's atmosphere, once it got back, to avoid.    Ryan Zeigler:  Exactly.  But the boxes are heavy and so they couldn't bring 10 boxes to bring back all those samples.  So, they decided that for some samples, just being sealed up and minor exposure to air would be okay.    Host:  Okay.  So, why did the dirt ended up being one of the more important pieces of Apollo 11?    Ryan Zeigler:  Well, one of the things they didn't realize -- because the impacts are so important on the moon, and a lot of the material just gets spread around.  And so, the dirt -- the soil -- the regolith, official -- is the technical name for it -- is a really good average composition of a large area on the moon, whereas the rocks mostly come from that local area.  So, you collect the rocks, you learn a lot about the local area.  You collect the soil, you learn about the local area, but also exotic stuff coming from farther away.  And it being so big, and hey, us having so much of it, everyone wanted Apollo samples when they came back, and obviously, we had a very limited mass.  And so, them bringing back more than they expected opened up new studies just based on mass availability.  And we also used those as a goodwill sample.  We -- every country on Earth in 1970 got a piece of the moon as a gift that came from that soil -- that big shoveled soil.  They took out the bigger particles, put them in plastic, took some flags they had flown to the moon, put it on a plaque, and they just handed it out to everybody.  It was great, yeah.    Host:  I wish I --    Ryan Zeigler:  All because -- all because Neil thought to shovel in a [inaudible] we're real close, so.  I call him Neil, so.  No, I mean all because he had the -- you know, the foresight to do something like that.    Host:  Exactly.  So, what was interesting about the Sea of Tranquility, whenever they were picking the location for Apollo 11?    Ryan Zeigler:  Honestly, I think it really came down to safety.  I mean they had some really strict constraints.  They -- first time, they wanted something near the equator, so they used less Delta V, less fuel.  They wanted something flat, so they'd have to worry about landing on, you know, a crater, which they almost did anyway, and they had to avoid it.  So, a lot of it came down to it had to be on the equator and it had to be flat.  And then they used spectroscopy.  They looked at the light and it was bouncing off the surface and trying to find a place that was slightly unusual.  And it turned out, Sea of Tranquility had a lot of titanium in it.  And so, the light bouncing off it looked a little different and so they thought, let's go try that place.  And then when they went to 12, they had similar constraints, but they went to the other end of the spectrum.  And they got low titanium basalts.  And so, you know, science wasn't driving the landing sights at that point, but they were still trying to maximize how much science they could get out of it.    Host:  Right and, you know, priority one was safety.  Priority two was all right, in terms of the safest areas we could land, this one is also --    Ryan Zeigler:  Exactly, that's how they did it.  Yeah.    Host:  Okay.  Cool.  So, what's -- what was interesting about titanium then?    Ryan Zeigler:  On Earth -- I mean this is sort of a technical detail that almost no one's going to care about.  But on Earth, you know, basalts only have a weight percent of titanium, 1% titanium.  And on the moon, that's 8 or 9% titanium, and it tells you about the interior of the moon and what was melting to form these basalts.  And it's quite different than Earth.  And so, it was telling us about how the moon formed and evolved, all from one rock on the surface.  And it wasn't the whole story, but it sure got things moving in the right direction.    Host:  All right.    Ryan Zeigler:  Otherwise, we've been wasting our time for 45 years.    Host:  Well, then so that was just a piece of the story.  And then you went to -- we went to different areas to kind of let -- you know, we have these Apollo missions, let's use them to our fullest advantage.  Let's figure out this story of the moon.  So, what were some of the decisions -- and you said Apollo 12 was lower titanium -- but what were some of the other decisions for the later missions?    Ryan Zeigler:  So, for the later missions -- if you look up at the moon at night -- and this is super basic, but there's dark parts and light parts.  And the first two missions went to the dark parts, those are mare basalts, like you would get in Hawaii.  And then there was the bright parts, which actually make up about 80% of the moon, so they need -- they were like, we need to go to one of these bright parts and see what make up the Highlands.  And so, same constraints, Apollo 14 landed pretty close to Apollo 12, near the equator, but in the Highlands.  And then they got those samples back and realized, wow, everything's an impact, everything's a breccia, a rock made of pieces of other rock.  It's like a jigsaw puzzle almost.  And then after that, when they got to 15, 16, and 17, those were the J missions, so they had a Rover, they had much more -- better suits, they had a lot of other stuff.  And so, then they were able to go to more technically challenging sites that were, at the junction, between the bright parts and the dark parts mostly.  And so, also, I mean I'm sure you know this and all of the pilot -- all of the Apollo astronauts are pretty much test pilots.  So, just landing on a flat bit, I don't think he was doing it for them.  And so, Apollo 15 and Apollo 17, when you hear the astronauts talk about what it was like to land there, like landing in this little narrow valley on Apollo 17, and Apollo 15 landing and coming over this huge mountain.   And then having to get down really fast and land onto -- before the big canyon.    Host:  Canyon.    Ryan Zeigler:  Yeah.  You know, and so, you know, they were able to do more technically challenging things with flying too.    Host:  Okay.  Yeah.  Well, that was -- that was their thing, right?    Ryan Zeigler:  Yeah.    Host:  But then on -- was it Apollo 17, Jack Schmitt, now you finally have a geologist, right?    Ryan Zeigler:  Right.  I mean, and Jack had played a really important part.  I mean Jack comes to all of our science conferences.  Jack has PhD in geology.  He's way smarter than I'll ever be, and he still comes to all of the -- all of the conferences and many, many, many a debate ends with, well, when I was on the moon -- and that's when you know you've lost the argument because he's really [inaudible].  You know, you don't get to use that.  No, Jack was there.  And so, he was able to help select the sites but when they were on the ground, he was -- you know, everyone got a -- basically a master's degree in geology as part of their training.  But he already had a PhD and was one of those people who trained the other astronauts in geology.  And so, he really was able to spot and collect things from a different perspective.    Host:  Okay.  And was -- did he have a part in deciding where they were going to land and what things to pick up and bring back?    Ryan Zeigler:  I'm sure he did.  And I mean he started to tell a story at a meeting a couple months ago, about well, that's not how we selected that site.  And he never finished the story, so I don't have the whole story yet.  But I don't think the sites were selected that far ahead of time.  As they were leading up to a new mission, the scientists and Jack, because he's one of the scientists, would get together and talk about where they wanted to go from science priorities.  And then the mission safety people would be like, yeah, we're not landing in the middle of Tycho Crater, that's crazy, and then there would be some back-and-forth.  And -- but yeah, no, Jack was definitely part of that discussion.    Host:  Okay cool.  So, what were -- what were some of the -- besides titanium -- what were some of the more interesting things that you found?  Because there's a finite number of samples we have from the moon, right?  So, what are -- were some of the most interesting things that we found from those samples?    Ryan Zeigler:  Well, they're really old.  I mean -- and that's -- that sounds very basic.  But essentially, every rock from the moon is older than every rock on Earth.  It's not perfectly true.  There's some overlap in the middle.  There's like four places on Earth where they're that old.  But it turns -- so the moon is just an ancient body.  The fact that everything was either a volcanic process of basalts, like what you'd see in Hawaii, or breccia, something from impact, that threw people off.  There was no water on the moon and that's not true anymore.  But compared to terrestrial rocks, which every rock you pick up on Earth has a mineral with water in it and they couldn't find any water in lunar samples until about 10 years ago.  And it was only when instruments had evolved to the point where they could measure lower concentrations and new scientists came along and said, this doesn't make sense.  We need to re-examine these.  And so, there was a little bit of missed from earlier.  But the moon is a very dry place and that throws people off.    Host:  So, you said there's-- parts of it, you said it's not true anymore.  Ten years ago, we discovered there's a little bit of water on the moon.  What was the instrument that found that and where is it?    Ryan Zeigler:  It was something called the SIMS, the secondary ion mass spectroscopy.  And so, what you do is you take the sample, you bombard the surface with ions, either positively or negatively charged, and then that sputters off what's there.  And before, we were using an electron probe, where you're doing essentially the same thing, but with electrons.  And they just -- they started looking at a mineral called apatite and on every other planet where you find that mineral, there's water in it.  And then when they started looking at it on the moon, there was a fair amount of water in it.  And so -- and it was one of those cases where the analytical instruments in the '70s were very good, and Apollo helped revolutionized them.  But the little bit of water -- the little bit that was missing, they just assumed was analytical error, and it was very hard to directly detect water because you're not doing it by mass, you're doing it by energy and so -- anyway.  So, they -- so this -- these new instruments -- which weren't new in the -- in the 2000s.  They were invented in the -- in the '80s.  But by the 2000s, when new scientists came along, that's when they started to figure it out.    Host:  Okay.  Isn't it also true that there are -- on the polar ends of the moon, there are [inaudible] shaded areas that have I guess never seen the Sun, are their deposits of water there too?    Ryan Zeigler:  Almost certainly.  We have limited direct evidence of that, but we have a lot of circumstantial evidence.  There's extra hydrogen there, so what's the hydrogen there as?  They -- you get a different radar back scatter out of there and one of the only things that causes that is ice.  And so, they did have the L Cross mission, which landed in one of these permanently shadowed regions, put up a plume of debris, and then it flew through it.  And they did detect water, and so we do have some direct evidence, but -- so that's a different kind of water.  So, I'm talking about water that came from the interior of the -- of the -- of the planet.  And the water that's at the poles probably is from comets and meteorites slamming into the surface over time.  And the ice that's in that, sort of migrating along the surface, and then freezing down in these cold areas.  And so, I -- you know, I'm talking about intrinsic water to the moon versus external water.  The external water might be more interesting for like refueling spacecraft someday.  Intrinsic water, it's very minor and so it's always going to be of geologic interest, but probably not economic importance.    Host:  I see.  So, when you say that you were looking at rocks and using these instruments to find little -- you know, use a different type of method to discover the water inside the rock, that was here on Earth, right?  That was here --    Ryan Zeigler:  All of that was done on Earth.  In fact, the -- in Apollo missions -- I mean you see the Mars missions now and they have Rovers and they do all these cool measurements on the -- on Mars, they didn't do that on Apollo.  They had some surface experiments where they did some geophysical experiments on the surface, but that was on the moon, as a whole, and not on the rocks.  The rocks were really not studied until they came back because anything they might have done on the surface could be done much better back on Earth.  And since they knew they were bringing the rocks back anyway, they didn't spend any mass, or time, or energy on that.  They just collected the rocks and brought them back.    Host:  Plus, you risk the chance of contamination.    Ryan Zeigler:  Exactly.  I mean we have a lot of talk now about, you know, what could be done on samples like on the way back and the answer is always like, don't touch the samples, just bring them back.  Just don't touch the samples.  We'll do it when you get them back here.  And we is not me, and we is not NASA.  We, is this -- the larger scientific community on the planet.  And so, I keep using the royal we.  And as my dad always asked, do you have a mouse in your pocket?  No, it's just, you know, it's a very large and active science community that studies all these samples.    Host:  Well, and the -- and one of the more important parts about that is there is a finite number of samples that you have, right?    Ryan Zeigler:  There is.  There is.    Host:  So, whenever they're bringing these samples back, the story from the Apollo days, what were some of the facilities that they were bringing them back to?  What were some of the methods to make sure that they were acquired safely and properly?    Ryan Zeigler:  So, they had designed Building 37 here at Johnson Space Center was the Lunar Receiving Lab and they finished that in 1967, so a couple years before it came back.  Because they had no real idea what lunar samples were like and because everyone has read War of the Worlds, they actually designed it as a quarantine facility.  And so, both the astronauts and the samples went into quarantine for 21 days after Apollo's 11, 12, and 14, to make sure all the bugs from the moon didn't kill all life on Earth.  And now once they got to the surface and they realized there was no water, and really no atmosphere, and they already knew that, they're like, there's no bugs in these samples.  But through an abundance of caution, for the first three missions, they kept the quarantine going.  And so, that was a facility designed to keep everything in, so everything leaked in.  And the problem with that is everything leaks in on the samples, and we're trying to keep the samples clean.  And so, once they realized, no, this isn't -- you know, this isn't a concern, we're not trying to keep the bugs in.  They redesigned laboratories in the building next door -- in Building 31.  And within about three or four years, they moved over and put most of the samples there in a positive pressure laboratory, where everything leaked out and everything leaked away from the samples.   And the samples were stored in glove boxes surrounded by nitrogen and no one ever touched them, no one ever breathed on them, or coughed on them, like me.  And so, yeah.  So, that was -- that was a pretty quick change they had to make.    Host:  Okay.  So, some of the later Apollo missions -- the samples collected from those I guess have some of the more pristine samples that you have here because of this method?    Ryan Zeigler:  Sort of.  I mean there's more of them and so some of them were able to be held in reserve.  But all of them originally came back and were open and then -- and initially analyzed in their lunar -- in the LRL, in the Lunar Receiving Lab.  And then it wasn't till like '73, '74, when all of the samples got moved over to the next -- to the next thing, so yeah.    Host:  So, then the actual study of -- or the actual process of studying, what's that like?  What is -- what do you do to actually figure out what's inside?    Ryan Zeigler:  Wow.  There's so many different studies.  So, I've been the Apollo curator for about six years now and I've had almost 400 individual requests to analyze sample.  So, I'd like to go through them one by one -- no?  Okay.  So, yeah.  Yeah.  No, it could be a long podcast.  You know, if you -- if you look at all of the collections in total, a lot of effort goes into dating the samples.  And you would think, yeah, we already know the date of them.  Well, as instruments and scientists get better -- oh, man -- the way they age date the samples has been refined over time.  And there's a couple different camps still trying to figure out exactly the age of the moon.  A lot of study has been on the new water they found.  But there's even esoteric things.  Like a guy in the UK wanted samples to do spectroscopy to figure out if he could see life on planet -- on exoplanets.  And so, all life on Earth has a chirality, it's all left-handed or right-handed, and I'm not a biologist, so I don't remember.  But if you look at the light that reflects off an atmosphere with that light in it, can have a chirality to it.   And so, they're from orbit and Earth, they're trying to do that.  And one of the main sources of contamination for them is light bouncing off the moon.  So, he needed to see what light bouncing off the moon looked like to put into his equations to understand whether they could see life on exoplanets from their atmospheres -- from spectroscopy of their atmospheres.  And so, every-- I mean everything in between.  It's just crazy how diverse Apollo samples and samples, in general, can be used.    Host:  So, it's fair to say you're still studying them though, right?    Ryan Zeigler:  Oh, absolutely.  This year, I -- you know, we have -- a new batch of requests just came in and we have 36 new requests for the -- to be considered by the committee that reviews all of these and they'll do that next month, so.  I -- they might find out about it on here.  They don't know how many we got, so they might be a little dismayed at how much work they have to do.    Host:  We'll put this out a little bit later, so we don't have any spoilers.    Ryan Zeigler:  No, that's okay.  They wouldn't listen to me anyway.    Host:  Okay, so when you're cracking them open -- and some of the -- some of the first times you were actually -- you -- now you have scientists that have their hands on these lunar samples -- the first time.    Ryan Zeigler:  They better not.    Host:  Well, oh, okay.  They have -- they have protective gloving -- gloves and --    Ryan Zeigler:  Yeah.  Sorry, sorry, sorry.    Host:  Proper equipment to analyze the samples for the first time, first time humans have ever done that.  What were some -- was some of the first things that they wanted to look at and some of the first things that they found?    Ryan Zeigler:  So, some of the very first measurements that were done, after the Apollo 11 samples came back, were actually done here.  So, the LRL was both the containment facility and the curation facility, but it also had a certain number of built-in instruments to do some of these initial preliminary examinations.  And one of them was to look at the radiation in the sample.  Now everyone hears radiation and thinks, Chernobyl or -- no, what they're trying to see is the natural radiation that every rock has.  And so, they built a special pit underneath Building 37 that was lined with dunnite, a special type of rock from Earth, battleship armor from pre-nuclear tests.  So, the -- it could drive down the low levels of natural background radiation.  Put the samples in front of a detector and then see just how much radiation was coming off of these.  And so that was one of the very first things done.  They had a gas lab to see what kind of gases came off it, whether there was a, you know, measuring the solar wind.  So, it was -- it was measurements like that that were initially done at Johnson Space Center.  And then almost immediately after those initial measurements were done, they went out to I think 50 or 60 different groups around the country who were pre-approved, and they all had different stuff they were doing.    Host:  Unbelievable.  So, I guess to work with this and to find out something specific, right, if you wanted to find out something more about radiation, there's something special that you have to design, something special that you have to do.  It's not just chiseling at it and looking at it and say, ah, there's the radiation.  There's like this huge -- this very unique type of experiment and facility that you have to design.    Ryan Zeigler:  Right.  And that particular facility was both expensive and time-consuming.  And so, that was the kind of thing that NASA was going to take on, where -- because they could use Apollo money on it.  And then other things that didn't require quite such specialized equipment, that could be done better by the experts in those individual fields at the different universities and other institutions.    Host:  There you go.  Okay, so I'm assuming that one of the main objectives, when you have these samples of moon rocks, is to find out what happened to the moon.  What was the formation of the moon?  So, does some of your findings support Giant Impact Theory?    Ryan Zeigler:  I think, at this point, pretty much all of the findings support Giant Impact.  Now there's still -- yeah.  I mean there's still a little bit of debate about how big the impactor was, or the exact timing, or -- but as far as I know -- and I go to all of these conferences, whether I like it or not, I'm -- and, you know, keep an eye on these guys.  And no, I mean everyone -- no one's arguing about -- at these science conference -- whether there was a Giant Impact.  They're arguing about the details of the Giant Impact.  I know there are one or two holdouts, but that they are being increasingly marginalized, just by the -- by the data that's coming off the samples.    Host:  So, we can pretty much sit down and say, yeah, it was some kind of Giant Impact Theory that formed it.    Ryan Zeigler:  At this point, yes.  I mean, although if you'd asked me 10 years ago if there was any water on the moon, I would have said absolutely not and everyone agrees on that.  And so -- but there's physics involved here and I don't understand physics because I'm a geologists.  But I mean the angular momentum of the Earth-moon system and the spin and all that, that's really hard to do any other way.  And that's not going to change, like we're not going to learn how to measure angular momentum better.  So, I don't think the Giant Impact is going away, yeah.    Ryan Zeigler:  Okay.  Okay.  That's fair.  So, kind of going back to some of the facilities that you have.  I'm imagining -- I'm imagining these guys in gloves and you said, oh, no, they're not going to be touching it.  They're going to be wearing proper equipment and they're going to be using -- you know, they're going to make sure they're not -- nothing's going to get contaminated.  What does that look like?  What is this -- you say, bunny suit?    Ryan Zeigler:  Well, so in our lab, if you want to come and study the samples -- so, yeah, you would put on a full bunny suit.  Think white polyester suit head-to-toe.    Host:  Okay.    Ryan Zeigler:  Basically, a pair of coveralls, cloth gloves, a hat.  Not -- we don't have to wear masks most of the time.  And then over boots.  And then you go into a laboratory that's sterile -- not sterile because they're -- that's very clean.  And then the samples are inside the cabinets.  And then you put your hands through neoprene gloves and then if you needed to handle the samples, themselves, on the inside of the neoprene gloves -- excuse me -- you would put Teflon gloves.  And so, you can only touch the samples with Teflon, or aluminum, or steel.  So, you would have to actually handle the samples in our laboratory through three layers of gloves, inside of a controlled atmosphere cabinet.  Yeah.  And so, now not everyone in their own lab has to do that because we have to keep the samples ready for anyone to do anything, as near as we can.  If somebody knows that they're not going to contaminate the samples by handling them in air, what -- when I did this at Washington University in Saint Louis, before I came here, we had a clean flow bench.  We would take the samples to JSC [inaudible].  We would open them, we would pour them out, then you rinse them off with acetone, you get some of the dust off.  Picked them up with tweezers, never touched them with my hands, despite what the pictures show.   And then we would get them ready and when we send them off to the reactor to do -- to do -- to do measurements and stuff like that.  So, clean space, controlled atmosphere, but not a controlled atmosphere -- sorry.  Not inside of a nitrogen glovebox.  And that's -- most people don't have the glove boxes we have.  They cost a quarter of a million dollars each and there's all this infrastructure that goes into it, so.    Host:  Wow.    Ryan Zeigler:  Yeah.  No.    Host:  Take your moon rocks very seriously.    Ryan Zeigler:  Yeah, well we spent 24 billion dollars to bring them back, we ought to -- we ought to keep -- you know, okay, we're trying to keep them safe for long term.    Host:  Exactly.  And like you said, you're still studying them and there's still a lot of things to be discovered.  So, the last thing you need is to -- is to waste any of the samples.    Ryan Zeigler:  You don't get to have two bad days in curation.  You have one bad -- you can't un-contaminate a sample.  If something goes wrong and water got on the samples, it's always going to have had water on it and it will eliminate certain number of measurements.  And so, no, we -- yeah, you're right.  We do -- we have procedures -- I mean I used to make fun of procedures before I came to NASA.  Now I really make fun of procedures, but I understand why they're important and why we have them.  And so -- and we have like 160 of them to run the lab and all the different things we have to do to them.  Yeah.    Host:  Wow.    Ryan Zeigler:  Yeah.  Auditors love us because we've got everything written down.  It's great.  Yeah.    Host:  Okay.  So, then that brings me to the thought that there's a finite number of -- or finite amount of moon rocks that you have.  So, how do you keep track of it?  How do you make sure that you have -- that you're taking advantage of this finite amount?    Ryan Zeigler:  With great effort.  So, every sample that we loan to a scientist to do study on -- to do a study on, we keep track of.  And everything's a loan and they have to return it.  So, if they destroy it, as part of the analysis, then great, then they have better have had permission to do that.  Then that's great, we mark that off.  But anything else, they would study, and they would come back.  And so, once a year, I send them all an inventory, and they have to check off and they say, yes, I have all these samples or no I don't, in which case bad things happen.  And no one ever says, no, I don't.  They're very, very conscientious.  And so, 125 inventories a year gets sent out and I have to -- you know, we all - we all take care of it.  Now we do in -- an internal inventory with JSC security where once a year -- or once every other year, they come by and they ask us to find every sample for them.  And so -- yeah, no.  And so, we have to meet the same bar as everyone else, just every other year, because we have 100,000 samples and most scientists have 50 or 100, so.    Host:  So, the interesting thing about the moon rocks is that you're still -- you've collected them so long ago but you're still finding stuff out, right?  And so -- so what are the -- some of the more recent findings that you've been having?    Ryan Zeigler:  Well, one of the more recent findings that has come out and in the last five or six years was that perhaps the Solar System didn't form the way we originally thought it did.  People noticed that there was a preponderance of samples on the moon that are 3.9 billion years old.  Now the age, itself, doesn't matter to you or me.  But within the Solar -- and they were all formed by giant impacts.  Now 600 million years after the Solar System formed, there shouldn't be a bunch of giant impacts.  Everything should have quieted down by that.  So, for -- to explain the lunar samples, they had to come up with a new dynamical model for the evolution of the entire Solar System.  So, originally, it was -- the new one was called the Nice Model because it was formed by a bunch of scientists in Nice, France, which I hope is true or I'm going to get phone calls.  And that said that Jupiter, and Saturn, and Uranus, and Neptune all formed in much closer to the Sun.  They gravitationally interacted and then they spread out 3.9 million years ago.  And when they did that, they took all of the asteroids and comments and spun them around the Solar System and that caused the Giant Impacts.  Now people don't like the Nice Model anymore.  Now they have something called the Grand Tack Model, but it doesn't matter.   Any of the models for planetary formation actually have to explain the ages that we see in the Apollo samples.  Now the ages, themselves, are actually old.  They figured that out early on.  But no one noticed how many ages were 3.9 and put two and two together with what it meant for the Solar System, as a whole, until more recently.  And so -- you know.  So, when people ask me what moon rocks can tell you about, I say, well, where Jupiter formed.  And they always look at me like I'm lying.    Host:  Well, it's kind of amazing how we can find so much about our Solar System, just from studying so close to home.  I've had a couple conversations with some -- some of the meteorite sample curators and like --     [ Inaudible ]    Host:  Yeah, I've had conversations with all of them and just the stories that you can find from analyzing these rocks are fantastic.    Ryan Zeigler:  And it's really nice because the meteorites are all really old.  So, almost all the meteorites are older than all the Apollo samples.  And all the Apollo samples are older than the Earth.  And so, each of them gives you a different window into how the Solar System formed.  And if we only had one, we wouldn't know the whole story, or even if we only had two.  Having all three is really important to understanding how things work.    Host:  So, looking towards the future, are there missions that you are kind of planning for for possibly extra curation missions or anything that is going back to the moon to analyze something new?    Ryan Zeigler:  Well, I mean there was just a big announcement yesterday, obviously, that, you know, NASA is refocusing on the moon and I think want to send people back to the moon.  And there was some talk about robotic missions, both to do in situ science, science on the surface, but also to hopefully bring back some samples.  I stayed at Wash U to be part of the Moonrise Team, which was a new frontiers mission, so a billion dollar mission, to bring back samples back from the far side.  We came in second twice to Juneau and OSIRIS-REx, I'm not bitter, especially while I was at the Juneau -- at the -- at the OSIRIS-REx launch.  No.  And then this most recent time, they just down selected Caesar and Dragonfly as the finalists for the next round of New Frontiers, so Moonrise won't go either.  But within those two, Caesar is a sample return mission.  It is a sample return mission from the surface of a comet.  So, there was a Rosetta Mission by Europe and it went and it -- you know, it went into orbit around a comet.  And then sent a lander and then studied that and I don't know that much about it.  And I don't know that much about Caesar yet because it's brand new.  But their plan is to bring back samples from the surface, both gas and ice, and I think rock samples, back from the surface of a comet, to Johnson Space Center, where we will curate them.   So, we're going to have to figure out how to curate gas and ice.    Host:  Oh, yeah.    Ryan Zeigler:  And it's not that we don't have an idea.  We do but we have never had to do it before.  And so, we're going to spend the next -- luckily, we have about 15 years to build up the capabilities to get ready for that.    Host:  Okay, so capabilities in terms of facilities.    Ryan Zeigler:  Right.  So, I mean keeping ice cold is easy.  There's lots of ice labs around the country.  But if you want to treat that ice like we treat rocks, where you're going to subdivide it, and that's different.  If you want to work on it cold, that's harder.  And also, there's cold and then there's cold.  So, minus 20, great, that's easy.  We can do that with a freezer.  Minus 80, oh, that takes robotics and [inaudible] minus 160, like do you really want to keep it like the temperatures on the comet, itself?  And these are things we still don't know all the answers to and we don't even know the requirements yet.  But this is going to be what we spend the next decade figuring out.    Host:  Okay.  All right.  Well, best of luck to you.    Ryan Zeigler:  Yeah.  Yeah.    Host:  It's going to be a long process.  Ryan, thank you so much for coming on.  That was -- that was fantastic to learn about everything -- all these moon rocks.  I've been dying to have this conversation.    Ryan Zeigler:  It was my pleasure.    Host:  Fantastic.  And it's crazy what the moon rocks can tell you, just from looking at these and that we're still finding stuff out and just, you know, the story of water that has to -- you have to rethink these thoughts that -- and findings from decades ago because there's something new that we found.  So, it'll be interesting to see what comes up in the future.    Ryan Zeigler:  Yeah.  Absolutely.    Host:  All right.  Very cool.  Thanks for coming on.    Ryan Zeigler:  All right.  My pleasure.     [ Music ]    Host:  Hey, thanks for sticking around.  So, today, we talked with Ryan Ziegler about moon rocks and the facilities that are keeping them.  And honestly, we're still hurting so much from these rocks.  If you want to know more about the rocks, you can go to the ARES site, that's our Astromaterials group.  It's ares.jsc.nasa.gov.  You can go to that site also to find out how to get your hands on a meteorite sample if you actually want to study meteorites or moon rocks.  On social media, you can follow the NASA Johnson Space Center accounts or the Astromaterials accounts, they have their own on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram.  You can go to any one of those accounts and use the hashtag ask NASA to submit an idea or question for the show or for I guess any other reason.  But if you want it to be brought right here on Houston, we have a podcast, just make sure to mention the show, and then we'll actually bring it on, maybe answer it, or dedicate an entire episode to it.  We have done in the past.  This podcast episode was recorded on February 14, 2018.  Thanks to Alex Perryman, and Tracy Calhoun, and Jenny Knotts.  Thanks again to Dr. Ryan Zeigler for coming on the show.  We'll be back next week."

                        "description": "Dan Huot (Host):  Houston, we have a podcast.  Welcome to the official podcast of the NASA Johnson Space Center.  This is episode 49, Launch America.  I'm Dan Huot and I will be your host today.  On this podcast, we bring in the experts, NASA scientists, engineers, astronauts, and leaders to tell you about all the coolest stuff taking place here at NASA.  Today we're talking once again launching from American soil with two different vehicles developed by two different companies, Boeing and SpaceX.  It's part of the Commercial Crew Program to enable the capability to launch people into space by private American businesses.  Today I'm sitting down with the manager of that program, Kathy Lueders, who's based over at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida.  We got a brief history of the program, how it started, and where it is now, a little bit more about the companies and their two different vehicles, and what's ahead for the future.  Very soon, we'll be announcing the crews that will be the first to travel on these vehicles, so stick around until the end to find out how to watch that live.   So, with no further delay, let's go light speed and jump right ahead to our talk with Kathy Lueders.  Enjoy.    Episode 49 features Kathy Lueders, Manager of the Commercial Crew Program, gives us a brief history of the program, how it started, and where it is now, a little bit more about the companies and their two different vehicles, and what's ahead for the future.  HWHAP Episode 49. This episode was recorded on February 14, 2018.   [ Music ]    Host:  I am sorry we're recording this in a refrigerator today.  So, I wish we had a jacket for you.    Kathy Lueders:  Oh, I'll try to keep my teeth from chattering.    Host:  But-- so, Commercial Crew and kind of want to get into, you know, where it all started.  So, the Space Shuttle Program was America's ride into orbit for about 30 years, but then it came to an end and that's kind of where the seeds for Commercial Crew started, correct?    Kathy Lueders:  Actually, I think Commercial Crew really started with the original concept that America could fly payloads on commercial vehicles.  So, I really think it started in the 90's in a lot of ways.  Yeah, even sooner, because I think when people started to think about flying, you know, DoD payloads on ELVs, that was kind of the beginning of starting to think about is there ways to use what's an emerging capability, a national capability, in ways that would help the space program.  And so, there was a couple different initiatives that were out there, Alternate Access to Space, a few other things that kind-- that really kind of planted that seed in several administrations about is there ways that we can kind of make space not just for NASA.   You know, for the longest time, space was just NASA's and then really in the 90's when you start moving into these commercial launch vehicles and launch-- and reliable capabilities, then that really-- once you had that reliable capability that's there, then it-- there's an option of, well, how can the space program potentially use this capability rather than create the capability.  So, I think this has been 30 years in the making.  And really as industry has shown that they can do and perform a function, I think then there's been this natural progression of then using that capability for the missions that industry can support and then that allows NASA to really move out into the areas where we're kind of pushing the envelope and where there's more risk, right?   And where really doing the research and the exploration that is really the government's role.    Host:  So, when did we start getting really serious?  Really serious-- I'm talking setting up programs, moving into buildings, stuff like that-- about using these capabilities for people.    Kathy Lueders:  So, in the 2008, 2009 timeframe, I think when we were-- I was working on cargo and at that time from, you know, the policy perspective, the White House, they started looking at, OK, well, we're developing this capability for cargo, really what then potentially would we be able to use this-- could we use this for crew?  I remember the COTS Program originally had been, you know, they had gone out with their initial proposals or their requests for, you know, proposals in the 2006 timeframe had been for Commercial Crew and Cargo.  It's why it was C3PO, right?  It was Commercial Crew and Cargo and so--    Host:  One of my favorite acronyms.    Kathy Lueders:  Yeah, mine too.  Alan was always way better at putting together a name of a program than we obviously were.  So, when they came in with those initial, you know, requests, companies did come in with concepts for how they were also developing their crew capability.  It wasn't just cargo.  We, at the time, you know, as we saw that evolving, really because station at that time really needed cargo capability with the-- with shuttle retirement.  At that time, you know, on the-- I was working for station and I-- we came in and built our initial concepts for being able to use the capability that Alan Lindenmoyer and his team were investing in over-- under the Space Act Agreements.  So, when the CRS contracts-- commercial resupply services contracts-- were then awarded and we were making progress towards actually conducting the missions, and working certification activities with Alan, then I think people started thinking, well, maybe there's a construct here that we can start working on for crew.    Host:  Kind of the cargo stuff was laying all the ground work and now we're going to springboard off of that and not just launch stuff, but launch people too.    Kathy Lueders:  On top of it, too, we learned a lot from cargo.  I learned a lot from cargo.  How to set it up, how to set up the certification phase, and so we did learn things about cargo that we said, for crew, this will have to be different.  And it's why starting in the 2009, 2010 and then, you know, we started working whitepapers on how do we do crew.  What are the different options for crew?  At the very beginning, it wasn't really-- you know, remember the first investment in crew was really through the ARA [assumed spelling] investments in 2010 and so there's very, you know, working the CCDev proposals, some very initial investment and because one of the things that we realized was under cargo, the infrastructure when the SAs were originally awarded, the companies had very little infrastructure there.  And so it was-- CRS was a very high risk-- high risk, high gain, high benefit, you know, procurement for us because really, before we awarded CRS, we did not have return capability for science.   Right?  We did not have, you know, extensive cargo capability going up and down.  It was really just going to be progress after shuttle retirement, so that was-- that was high risk, high reward for us.  But with crew, it has to be safe, reliable-- the risk level and the tolerance is-- it goes down.  So, then it was really important for us to lay-- start laying the foundation of how do we go look at what are current gaps in industry that we need to beef up and invest in over the next few years.  So, that was kind of the 2010, 2011, 2012, you know, timeframe.  And then in 2013, we said, OK, it's time to go do a certification contract and then start buying missions for crew.    Host:  And so that's what actually got us to where we are kind of today where there's two companies getting ready to fly American astronauts again.    Kathy Lueders:  Two companies.  They have their-- spacecraft is really, really cool right now.  I can't tell you-- go out to SpaceX, you see spacecraft in the building, one-- our DM1 vehicle's getting ready to roll out to go to Plum Brook in a week and a half.  You go over into the C3PF down in Florida and the Boeing spacecraft, you get C3 spacecraft, the Spacecraft 1's getting ready to get shipped out to go support pad abort test.  Spacecraft 2's getting ready to get shipped to California to go through environmental testing and that will eventually come back and become our first crewed flight test vehicle.  And Spacecraft 3 is getting assembled and will be getting ready to fly later this year.  So, it's-- we have-- it's really, really cool.  We have six spacecraft in different stages of construction and really final integration and testing right now to support all the critical system-level tests, but also for the demonstration test.   And on-- and getting ready for our post-certification mission.  So, it's really a fun stage of the program right now.    Host:  It's kind of like all of those years of this being on paper and presentations and stuff like that, but now there's-- you can walk into a room at multiple places around the country.    Kathy Lueders:  Lots of hardware.  Lots of hardware.    Host:  And see something that's getting ready to go to space.    Kathy Lueders:  When I-- when I came over from station in 2013, as deputy program manager at JSC, I had just launched-- had been launching both the SpaceX demo flights and the initial CRS missions for SpaceX and we were getting ready to launch the demo flight for Orbital and had three spacecraft in work on the Orbital side.  And I was just so excited and then Alan asked me to come over and be deputy and I thought, oh, here I'm going to go all the way back to that paper stage that you're talking about just after working all-- doing and putting all this work into it and get these vehicles and it's so exciting to see the vehicles and then we were back at the paper stage.  But we quickly started getting into really what it takes to go start putting vehicles together and go fly these missions.    Host:  So, you moved over to the Commercial Crew Program.  Let's talk a little bit about that.  Kind of-- so where is it based?  What is-- what is the Commercial Crew Program on NASA's side doing with these companies?    Kathy Lueders:  So, I kind of view the Commercial Crew Program as like tech transfer on steroids.  That's how I kind of view it, right?  Because we have really been like the conduit for providing, you know, the 50 years of NASA human spaceflight experience to both these companies.  And allowing them to have that is really the great thing about NASA going and doing this exploration-- I mean we are still using the data off of the early manned flights.  You know, Apollo has been a wealth of experience for both these companies and all the chute testing and all the tests that they did, you know, amazing amount of experience.  So, as we're doing these missions, you just don't know that 30, 40 years that that data is still relevant and helpful for us to then be able to then-- for these companies, it would have been cost-prohibitive for them to have been able to go and replicate all the data and what we learned out of doing those, you know, early human spaceflight missions with the capsule designs.   I mean they really, really learned from that.    Host:  Has it gone to the level, like, do you have old Apollo engineers that have come back in or has somebody been, you know, digging up old schematics from an archives room somewhere?    Kathy Lueders:  All-- there's definitely been a lot of digging and pulling data and pulling everything.  You know, the companies will come in and say, hey, we're having this kind of a problem and having people that have been out there and have learned and said, hey, I had that problem, you know, this is what we did, but most importantly, I say it's been tech transfer on steroids from a NASA perspective, but it's also tech transfer from the company's perspective.  We've-- you know, we've-- our engineers on Commercial Crew have been-- have had the opportunity to be able to work on not, you know, the two spacecraft designs, but then also be working with Sierra Nevada on, you know, their winged vehicle designs.  And also have been able to work with Blue Origin on their suborbital vehicles.  And so, when you think about how you're tooling the next industry of explorers, there's nothing better than having an engineer that's been able to have this exposure to all these different vehicles.   One of my favorite stories is one of the co-ops here at JSC was doing their outbrief and they talked about how they did aerodynamic studies on three different spacecraft.    Host:  Wow.    Kathy Lueders:  Now, you know, Orion, you know, the Boeing CST-100, and the Dragon.  I mean just think about how many people could be out there in the world that could say that that was their co-op project for the year?    Host:  That's a competitive resume.    Kathy Lueders:  That's a very competitive resume for a student.  I thought, you know, yeah.  Amazing.    Host:  Well, let's get into the vehicles a little bit because we are going to be launching crew, but I mean these are the-- these are the slick new cars in the garage that everyone's excited to see.  So, I'll just go alphabetically and we'll start with Boeing.  So, the Starliner.  Tell us a little bit more about that spacecraft.    Kathy Lueders:  So, the Starliner has really, you know, they-- the way the Boeing company has built this, they really built off-- they have a tremendous amount of experience in human spaceflight and so they've really taken a lot of their-- the experience out there, using a lot of the aero-- it's a capsule design.  It's aerodynamically operates a lot like other capsule designs.    Host:  One thing I wanted to bring up because people always-- any time they see Orion, any of these other spacecraft, they always ask us, well, that looks like Apollo.  Why do these-- why are all these brand-new spacecraft, why do they look the same as something from, you know, decades ago.    Kathy Lueders:  Because it goes back to there's two really important things to be able to design a safe vehicle.  One is to really understand the environments and two is to understand how to build something that can, you know, hold up to those environments.  And how many times has a spacecraft come hurdling down and, you know, landing on the earth?  Not very often.  And so, what-- you can go try to go build your own data sets, or you can really leverage off of the data sets that are out there.  And so, I think both companies, they-- what they were trying to-- their number one goal was not to expand the knowledge of-- that's the nice thing about commercial is they're trying to say how do I get from the-- with the data I have, how do I get to a spacecraft as quickly as possible?   And so, their whole goal is what's the data that's already out there and how can I use that data to then be able to design a spacecraft-- and know enough about the environments to make sure that that spacecraft will operate within regimes that I know that it can survive.  Right?    Host:  So, kind of like we know this shape works for-- we know that if we build it and it looks like this and it's coming back from space, we know that that--    Kathy Lueders:  We should have a good idea about what it is.  Obviously, there's different variants, right?  The Apollo-- when you look at the Apollo and Orion, they're spacecraft, they are-- they're way bigger because of the way their missions are, right?  The CST-100 and the Dragon, they're like fairy flights.  Right?  So, it needs to be big enough to get at least the four people up and, you know, be able to not kill each other in the two or three days or the day that it takes to get to station and have a little bit of movement and be able to do some basic functions and stuff like that, but no party room.  Right?  And it needs to be on orbit and a place where people can go hang out if they need a safe haven function, but it's not for doing a long-term mission.  Right?  So, if when you look at the vehicles, you know, the companies with our goals in mind-- and we didn't tell them you have to have a spacecraft this big.   We said we need a spacecraft that can fly four people safely to the International Space Station and back that has to be reliable and we want it to be cost-effective.  So, then they said, OK, how do I optimize that for the mission I have and also for hopefully flying on the cheapest rocket.  Not the cheapest from a reliability standpoint, but to be able to have it in the smallest rocket as possible to be able to support the mass.  It's always this big mastery that people have, right?  So, you know, when you look at Apollo and you look at Orion, those vehicles are really tailored for their mission.  When you look at the CST-100 and the Dragon, they're tailored for this very flight mission that they have.    Host:  Gotcha.  Well, back to CST-100.  So, four seats?  Four people launching inside the capsule?    Kathy Lueders:  So, they actually have-- they have more capability.  They actually have proposed a fifth seat, so we have a fifth seat capability.  We right now are focused on kind of optimizing it for our mission, which is the four seat and the cargo for that, but they actually proposed a fifth seat.  And then the SpaceX, we're working a four-seat with all our cargo complement, but they actually also advertised seven, commercially.  So, it's always-- you can go-- what's really cool, you can go on websites and see what commercially they're offering and then we can, you know, we've kind of optimized for our mission certain cargo complements, certain crew complements that kind of support the station mission.    Host:  It is pretty cool because you-- you said we kind of gave them this is what we need it to do and this is what they come back with and you're seeing two different companies, two different designs, two different capabilities, but they're each going to accomplish our mission, but then we now have these commercial companies that might have their own thing.    Kathy Lueders:  I think that's one of the funnest [phonetic] things about this job is that people-- when our NASA engineers work with the companies, we-- it's a collaboration, right?  It's a partnership.  And we come to the table and said, well, this is kind of what we did for shuttle, you know, this is kind of what we did here and this is what we have-- this-- you know, this is what we've been working with on the Orion side.  But then they'll come in and say, well, this is what I learned on cargo Dragon for the SpaceX guys and the Boeing guys will say this is what we've been working on, this is how it optimizes it.  And we're all learning together and it's really-- I think that's kind of the funnest part is I've seen our crew come in and say, well, we think this is what it is, but let me go talk to them and we'll go figure out.  Let's go understand what are they optimizing because these are flying a safe and reliable vehicle and having it be cost effective, it's like this big puzzle.  Right?  And so, you've got to get all the puzzle pieces together right to have it work perfectly, but each of the puzzles look a little bit different.   Right?  And so, you've got to be careful sometimes.  You can't come in and-- with your Orion puzzle piece.  That doesn't necessarily-- isn't optimized for a CST-100 or a Dragon.  Right?  You've got to be careful.  So, it's-- the team really is learning a lot.  It's really a fun, fun project.    Host:  All right.  Well, let's talk about everybody's favorite moment, launch.  How are these vehicles getting into space?    Kathy Lueders:  So, it's really cool for me because my house is at-- in Florida.  So, it used to be when I was getting ready for the cargo vehicles I'd have to go down and stay in Florida and wait and wait and wait for when we're ready to launch, right?  But both these provide-- but now I have my house in Florida, so I can wait and wait and wait at my house while we're waiting for-- sleep in my own bed while we're waiting to launch, yes.  But both providers are launching from KSC.  The Boeing vehicle, CST-100, is launching on Atlas V, so it's flying out of the complex 41.  I always have to think it through, 40 is SpaceX, 41, 39A, and then SpaceX is 39A, so they're-- you know, they retrofitted one of the shuttle pads and so they'll be flying their crewed missions and the Falcon heavy missions out of 39A, so that's going to be really, really cool.   It's nice, I can see both of them out of my office window.  So, it's-- I already got to see how the Atlas V complex has changed with the crew access arm already being on and we've changed-- already Commercial Crew has changed the look of that pad and we're getting ready to change the look of 39A when the crew access arm starts going up this late summer out at-- with SpaceX.  So, it's pretty exciting.    Host:  So, Boeing on the Atlas V and SpaceX on their Falcon 9.  Both of those rockets have launched stuff, but not people and there's some extra work to make sure that you can put people on them, right?    Kathy Lueders:  Yes.  There is a lot of extra work.  You know-- and, you know, both-- like always, the two companies have kind of taken it a little bit different route.  Really with Atlas V they've gone-- really they have their proven reliability, they've been doing their systems a certain way, and so we've been really working with them on working through all the certifications and understanding and building off of really what the Air Force folks have already done and our own NASA Launch Services Program folks have been doing to go make sure that all the human rating requirements that we need for crew launches-- that they're still meeting them.  And the SpaceX folks, they've been doing a major upgrade for their Block 5 upgrade and as part of that they've added-- they chose to add some additional redundancy in parts of their vehicle to be able to fly crew.  But, for both companies, really what we've been working with them on is how do they insert the whole crew insertion into their timeline while still making sure that we keep consistent loading and launch profiles as close to what they do for payloads.   Because you really want consistency.    Host:  Yeah.    Kathy Lueders:  Right?    Host:  So, there's one thing I've always kind of wondered and it's when it comes to human rating a rocket, I guarantee there's a million and one requirements, but what are some of kind of the big differences between a rocket that, yeah, we can launch a satellite that and, yes, we can launch a human on that?  Are there any-- again, I bet there's, you know, a million and one differences, but are there any kind of like big-- like you cannot have the rocket doing this, a rocket must have this-- that kind of stuff?    Kathy Lueders:  So, we-- one of the things we worked really, really hard on was how to have requirements-- I already gave you my examples of the requirements, so I just said flight for crew, right?  And so, we tried not to have requirements that were prescriptive, but what we wanted to make sure is that the systems that they had in place controlled the hazards that were-- that the vehicles expose the crew to.  And that they had the necessary hazard controls in place for us to be able to put crews on their vehicles.  And so, really, this has been a kind of an arduous process with the providers is that you don't typically have to do that for the payloads.  But, for crew, we've had to go through a safety review process with both companies where we're going through, OK, how do you get ready for launch, how do you process a vehicle, and then how are you making sure that-- and that you're listing all of the hazards that are involved.   Obviously, you know, a rocket's kind of like a controlled explosion in some way.  Like how do you make sure that that-- that all those things that are needed for the rocket to work are done in a way that minimizes the risk to the crew?  And so, we've gone through kind of an extensive process where they've listed their hazards and then what are all their controls and then how are we going to verify those controls.  That's been probably the biggest part of our requirements.  That is, really making sure that they have controls for their hazards in place.  The second part of it is typically for commercials for payload users, they don't necessarily come in and say here's your design and construction standards.  Here's how you-- you know, this is what we view as kind of the key parts of making sure you have a reliable and safe vehicle.  And the Air Force and Launch Service Program have typically said give us your standards and we want to make sure that you are following your standards and that's really the process that they go through to certify.   With human rating requirements, we have a list of standards that engineering or SNMA have come in and said for them to be human rated you have to show compliance to those standards, to the human standards.  But-- so this has been a big challenge for the program because, one, we don't really want-- we would like to have their standards really-- them be able to operate to their standards.  We don't want a special group of standards because we would really like-- if they've been flying reliably, it would be good to continue processing in that way.  So, the big challenge that the program's had is going and comparing the commercial provider standards to our standards and saying do these meet the intent.  And maybe there's been a few small focused areas where we've had to work with the providers on, but overall I think both providers have had-- have had good standards, good processes, and been able to work it.   The two areas that are unique that no commercial providers work, but that have been human rating standards for us are fracture control-- that was-- is a new kind of requirement set.  It's really making sure that you have materials that don't fatigue and if they fail that it doesn't-- they don't fail in a way that's catastrophic.  That's very important to us.  And typically hasn't been applied for launch vehicles because those are-- these are, you know, very short mission typically, and with the robustness of the vehicle, typically haven't had to do that.  But with crew, that's an area that we really want to make sure that there's not some kind of a fatigue failure that could end up being a catastrophic failure.  There's a new mechanism standard that's pretty new for us and so that hasn't been necessarily flowed out to industry.  One of our goals is is to not only-- is to really help industry develop their human rating standards.   You know, my dream one day would be I don't have to do an equivalency because somebody else has already gone through.  Just like when I get on a plane, it would be beautiful if somebody else has already certified the rocket, right?  But right now we're the only people that certify human-rated rockets, but that doesn't mean that that's not-- that could change in the future.  You know?  We've been working with other agencies and different, you know, the AIAA and other organizations to go look at is there some way that we could take our learning that's been in our standards and make them available so that industry at some point adopts standards that they then can use so that we're not in the middle of the certification.  But this is just a step, right?  This is just a step.    Host:  We go through the painful process now, so hopefully down the road everything's safe and already laid out for everybody.    Kathy Lueders:  The tech transfer on steroids.    Host:  That's right.    Kathy Lueders:  Tech transfer on steroids.  This is another place, right?  We've got all this experience, you know, and really our standards are just key things-- they're like our book of hard knocks, right?  We're like, oh, crap, write that one down.  Don't do that again.  You know?  Oh, crap, please do this.  Don't do that one again.  Right?  And so-- so, that learning, I mean, has already been out there in industry over time.  You know, there's aerospace standards that have been out there because companies have been working with NASA for the last 30, 40 years.  This is another area where I think we just-- the human part of it we just have to work on.    Host:  All right.  So, they've launched.  How are they controlled?  Because this is also kind of a whole new thing for us.  I mean, throughout NASA's history, we have-- we have our mission control and, you know, that's the room, that's who has their finger on the button kind of thing, but for these providers, it's going to be different.    Kathy Lueders:  Well, so what's really cool is when we went out for our certification and our services, we said you go figure it out.  You know?  You figure out where you want to be-- where you want to be controlled.  So, both of them actually-- you know, KSC, once you launch, they-- both of them have, obviously, launch control centers at the Cape to go to support the vehicles.  And then they also have mission control centers to handle the initial, obviously, comm with the spacecraft.  Right?  But then, for SpaceX operations, they hand back over to MCCX, which is in Hawthorne.  And for--    Host:  In California.    Kathy Lueders:  In California.  Hawthorne, California.  Yeah, thank you.  And for Boeing, it actually is going to be controlled out of MCCH.  Boeing has a arrangement-- task plan-- with our mission control, our FOD, our Flight Operations Directorate--    Host:  Here in Houston.    Kathy Lueders:  Here in Houston.  Here in Houston.  So, it-- and so, we'll be-- along with the ISS control center here, there will be a Boeing mission control center here too that will be monitoring and operating that vehicle and working together for joint ops.  The same control center for-- that works the cargo vehicles for SpaceX right now will be also-- it's in the process of being upgraded to also be handling the crewed missions.    Host:  And this might get into the weeds a little bit, but how much-- so, these new spacecraft, are they going to be-- because, for example, the Russian Soyuz, largely automated, automated docking, you know, the crew has some tasks on board, mission control is largely monitoring.  Shuttle was a lot of, you know, onboard flying for the crew and stuff like that.  Where are these vehicles going to kind of fall and are they-- again, are they different?    Kathy Lueders:  So, I think both of them are fairly autonomous.  If you think about it, it kind of goes back to once again the commercial concept.  Right?  If you're a company that wants to have control over how your vehicle is operating and with the capabilities they have today, with computer-- the processing capability and everything else-- they're really developing very sophisticated autonomous rendezvous and docking and reentry capabilities.  And so, really crew is there as a monitoring function and back up in case some-- like something really goes wrong, but these, they're really-- both companies are designing their spacecraft to be two-fault tolerant to a failure.  All along the way.  Very robust, which is really our intent.  We wanted to have very robust vehicles.  Right?  Very robust vehicles.  We asked them to design their vehicles to be two-fault tolerant and to not have crew as a control.  So, we-- that was a-- kind of goes back to safe and reliability being kind of important tenets and the companies have really come through.   They have different strategies for how they do that and they'll be checking out that autonomous capability on their first demonstrations because they'll be uncrewed [phonetic].  They'll be uncrewed demonstrations to the ISS, so that will kind of prove out that autonomous capability.  I always tell people I'm-- I know we've got self-driving cars out there, but I'm really hoping that before they roll out their first commercial one, the first commercial self-driving crew vehicle that's being bought by the government is going to be a crew transportation vehicle that's going to the ISS and so--    Host:  It's going to be a spacecraft.    Kathy Lueders:  Yes.  It's going to be a spacecraft.  We're ahead of the game.  We're in front of them.    Host:  Very cool.  Well, so it's launched, it's flown itself flawlessly to the space station.  The crew has been onboard, they undock, it's time to come home.    Kathy Lueders:  You know, and if it goes flawlessly to the space station, I'm like then really good in my life.  So, it's like-- we'll learn things along the way, right, but it will go and it will reliably-- safely and reliably get there-- and we'll be docking and we'll be learning stuff along the way.  I absolutely know that.    Host:  And then when it's time to come home, how are these vehicles coming back?  Because that's going to be different, too, right?    Kathy Lueders:  Yeah.  They have-- so both of them use, you know, they have orienting thrusters, kind of, and then they both use a parachute landing, you know, a parachute-assisted landing.  Boeing is going to be landing on the western part, they have five landing sites on the western part of the United States.  Kind of ranges from California-- you know, all your, like, the Dugway, Wismer [assumed spelling], all the, you know, the open desert kind of areas.    Host:  Lots of emptiness.    Kathy Lueders:  Lots of empty-- oh, yeah, don't want anybody nearby.  And then SpaceX is going to be-- they're looking at two water landing sites near the-- off the Florida coast on both sides of the Florida coast, and so kind of trying to give themselves kind of as many options as possible.  Primary is off the east coast of Florida right now.    Host:  So, that'll be-- I mean that'll be pretty interesting because, I mean, Soyuz we're landing on land over in Kazakhstan, so--    Kathy Lueders:  The big open space-- we don't have this big-- as much big-- I wish we had-- I wish we had a Kazakhstan, but we don't have that.    Host:  Well, I think New Mexico will be close.  That desert's pretty sparse from what-- but I mean have we-- have we ever landed American spacecraft on land in America before?    Kathy Lueders:  We have not.  I don't think.  We have not.    Host:  So, that'll be an exciting first.    Kathy Lueders:  Now, there's, you know, not from orbital.    Host:  Oh, I mean other than shuttle.  Sorry.    Kathy Lueders:  Blue Origin did suborbital demos, but, yeah, this will be the first time.  And, you know, so the other-- I'm going to say it again, tech transfer on steroids, but the other really cool thing about this is it's-- we're learning how to work with different agencies.  So, if you can imagine, you know, the first-- the demonstration missions are NASA missions, so we're going to be working with FAA for clearing airspace for those and with our contractors.  But, when we start getting into our post-certification missions, those will be FAA-licensed missions and so we've been working with them on how do you clear airspace for a capsule that's coming across L.A. or, you know-- you know, like-- I mean there's-- so, yeah, so there's-- it's going to be-- we're learning on how are we going to do this.  How do we really do commercial spaceflight and landing and landing in these different areas and working with other agencies and Air Traffic Control and all these other things and doing these for these commercial missions.   Not just-- not things that people really think about, but it's really what makes it work.    Host:  So somebody, you know, on final approach at LAX doesn't look out the right side and see a spacecraft and parachutes coming at them.    Kathy Lueders:  That would be bad.  That would not be good.    Host:  Well, all right, well, so you've mentioned the PCMs, the demos, kind of lay out the cadence of how this is all going to unfold for us for both of these companies.  You know, what missions are kind of, you know, on the schedule and what does a PCM even mean?    Kathy Lueders:  Oh, OK.  So, we call-- both providers-- originally when we did the contract, we said, you know what, we don't want to just jump into missions, our long-term long-duration missions to the space station.  Because we'd really like to have a trial run with the vehicles.  And so, we originally put in the contract just to have a demonstration mission.  A crewed demonstration mission that kind of checked out the whole vehicle.  We got to have on-orbit time with the vehicle before we start using these vehicles for our post-certification missions.  When I say PCMs, it's really the crew rotation flights.  It's the-- it's the long-term-- like the-- like a Soyuz increment-- equivalent.  Right?  So, actually both providers came back and offered up both an uncrewed demonstration mission and a crewed demonstration mission before we run into the cadence of doing the long-term missions.   Now, we are-- they're both getting ready for their uncrewed demonstrations and they're both shooting for this fall for the uncrewed demonstrations.  And then, within three of four months, both of them are planning to fly their crewed demonstration missions after the uncrewed demonstration missions.  Just as a-- we-- just as a-- I would say almost a security blanket, but it's not quite.  You know, we-- one of the things as program manager that I worry about is making sure the-- that, A, the space station has capability to fly their crews and to support on-orbit operations for space station.  They need crews on-orbit.  And what's really-- so, we need to get there, and we need to get there fast, but we need to get there safely and we need to get there reliably.  And so, one of the things we just did a few months ago was we just added the capability contractually for Boeing to be able to-- if everything goes well on their orbital flight-- their uncrewed flight test-- for them to be able to potentially stay up longer for their crewed flight test.   What that does is it gives them-- it gives us potential additional capability, but then it also lets them have if they need more time to then get their orbital flight test vehicle back, they use that vehicle again, so it gives them more time to then be able to refurbish that vehicle and get that vehicle ready for then their first post-certification mission.  Which right now is in the 2019-- late 2019, early 2020 timeframe.  The first time you're refurbishing anything that goes back to-- I maybe was a really great person my whole life, but what I found out as a manager and engineer is you learn stuff.  Right?  They're going to learn things about that vehicle and how it operates and how it comes down and we need to make sure that that vehicle has the time that it needs to be checked out and made sure that it's all ready to go before we send it back up for one of our post-certification missions.    Host:  That's right.    Kathy Lueders:  As we get through the demonstration missions, then, ideally, you know, we've kind of stacked up our missions because one thing-- it kind of goes back to the theme of making sure the providers have the time that they need to fly safely and reliably.  We've made sure that they-- both contractors have the capability to be able to fly a consecutive crew mission if we need-- if the other one needs help.  Right?  So, we'll be monitoring.  We'll be looking at it-- both providers will be learning things, and then-- but eventually we have two crew rotation missions to station and so each of the providers will have a mission to station and then we'll see.  We'll see what other kinds of missions.  You know, we're in the process right now of understanding how do we commercially use the space station and so we already are working with both providers on maybe they have other passengers or other missions or other things that they're working on proposing and so we're really hoping that, through us using these folks, that that then will jumpstart-- potentially jumpstart their use by other providers.   And then kind of, you know, provide a platform for other commercial and research and other uses in low-Earth orbit.    Host:  So, it's not just us.    Kathy Lueders:  I-- you know, I always tell people, space is not for-- just for-- is not just for NASA anymore.  Space is not just for NASA anymore.  It is for all of us.  It is for every American.  It is for you.  It is for my children.  It is for all of us.  It's just not there for somebody with a gold badge.    Host:  Well, you just checked off a whole bunch of stuff I was going to ask you about, but-- so, I mean, the future looks really bright right-- especially right now, as we're getting so close to these test flights getting off the ground and like that will be super exciting.  And then we're going to have people launching from Florida again to the space station and then we might have non-NASA people launching on these vehicles and these companies doing all kinds of crazy stuff.  What about beyond low-Earth orbit?  Do you see eventually these commercial companies spreading their wings even a little bit further out?  Maybe not specifically these ones, but right now we're working really hard to commercialize low-Earth orbit.  What about beyond that?    Kathy Lueders:  Who knows.  You know, I think if you-- when I first started working commercial cargo in 2005, 2006, people would say you're never going to fly.  You guys are never going to fly.  This is crazy.  And look at-- we've-- we're on CRS 15.    Host:  Oh, yeah.    Kathy Lueders:  Yeah.  I-- so, who knows--    Host:  There's an orbital vehicle up there right now.    Kathy Lueders:  Yeah, there's an orbital vehicle up there right now.  So, in 2008, if you would have said we're flying crew-- even when we were doing the whitepapers and looking at it, people said you're crazy.  This is like-- we're never going to do that.  People will never-- people are never going to be able to do it.  So, who knows?  You know?  I think our job is to dream for the nation.  Right?  And so, I think, yes, I think they will be out there.  I think it's going to be like, you know, Solo just opened up over the last, you know, in the movie theaters-- I guess not very well, but in the movie theaters over the last few weeks-- and who knows, right?  There's a reason why we keep having these same dreams.  We've been having these dreams for a long time.  Maybe it'll take us a little bit longer to get there, but for some reason we've been having these dreams for all of us to have our own spaceship one day.  You know, I grew up on the Jetsons.  We're not there.  But who knows?  Who knows?   I don't think we can stop dreaming.  So, I think when we say we can't is when we stop.  So, I think-- I think they can be out there.  It may take us another hundred years, it may take us another, you know, who knows.  But who knows?  What I do know is that when I'm down at the Cape and I see what just people doing cargo has done, you know, just our investment in cargo meant that the Launch Services Program had another viable launch vehicle to be able to fly medium-class missions.  And it meant that you got a bunch of other space companies out there now-- Blue Origin's got a fantastic facility, you know, on the outside of the gates at KSC, and look at-- I just saw a sign that said, you know, it was advertising Titusville, Florida, and it said we've had more launches from the Space Coast than we've ever have.   Huge resurgence, right?  So, who knows?  But it's the dreaming, I think-- I think there was a dream and we made it happen and then who knows.    Host:  All right.  That's awesome.  I like that one a lot.  I think we just about exhausted it for today.  That's kind of it.  I want to thank you for coming and sitting down with me and spending a little time.  Glad we could steal you away from a couple of meetings for a little bit.    Kathy Lueders:  Yeah, I got to turn off my phone.  I was pretty excited about that.    Host:  Wonderful.  All right.  Thanks, Kathy.    Kathy Lueders:  OK.  Thank you.     [ Music ]     Host:  Well, thanks again for listening.  We just scratched the surface on NASA's Commercial Crew Program.

                        "description": "Gary Jordan (Host): Houston, we have a birthday.  Welcome to the official award-winning podcast of the NASA Johnson Space Center.  This is Houston, We Have a Podcast, and we just won the Silver Excalibur Award from the Public Relations Society of America just recently.  So yes, we're an award-winning podcast.  Thank you for joining us.  This is episode 52, our annual anniversary.  Because one year ago -- I guess tomorrow -- from the release of this podcast we just started with episode one of Houston, We Have a Podcast, and what a ride it's been.  So we've brought in so many different scientists, engineers, and astronauts to talk about a huge variety of topics and share their incredible stories.  So to celebrate a year of Houston, We Have a Podcast, I brought in the podcast team to go in front of the mics this time.  So today I'm talking with producer, audio engineer, and I like to call audio wizard, Alex Perryman.  And then we're also bringing in Dan Huot, who's been a guest, co-host, and a host for the show.   We'll talk about how the podcast got started and reflect on some of our favorite moments.  So if you're new to the show, this will give you a nice snapshot of some of the conversations we've had so far.  So with no further delay, let's go light speed once again and jump right ahead to our talk with the podcast team of Houston, We Have a Podcast.  Enjoy.     [ Music ]    Host: All right, guys.  It's been a year.    Alex Perryman:    Host: Happy birthday.  Happy birthday.  We got a cake in the middle, it says Houston, we have a birthday.  You're welcome.    Alex Perryman: Thank you, thank you.  Since Dan's not going to say anything, thank you.    Dan Huot: I'm just -- I was just thinking, like, we were so close to starting the podcast on Alex Perryman scholastic achievement day, but we just missed it but, like, a week or so.    Alex Perryman: Yay.    Host: Wait is it -- oh, it was last week?    Alex Perryman: Yeah, it was June 12th.    Host: How did I miss that?  Was I away?    Dan Huot: It was on the work calendar.    Alex Perryman: No, you were here.    Host: I was here, but you thought I wasn't here.    Alex Perryman: Yeah.    Host: Okay, I'm sorry.  Happy work achievement day.    Alex Perryman: Thank you.    Host: I should know, I see you, like, multiple times a week.    Alex Perryman: Oh, yeah.    Host: Yeah, that would be cool.  Well, so today is the one-year anniversary.  One year ago tomorrow, I guess, by the time this releases it will be one year of Houston, We Have a Podcast.  I didn't think that that happened.  We were just kind of doing the podcast, and then next thing you know, a year goes by.  And so I thought this would be a perfect time to get all of us together, the guys that have been doing the podcast since the beginning, and just sort of reminisce and talk about the podcast.  End especially for new listeners this is a perfect opportunity to really get into some of the best moments and really -- if you're just tuning in, this is kind of the highlights, some of the moments that really got us started here.  But, you know, I always say, you know, thanks to producer Alex at the end of the movie or producer Alex, cue the music, you know?  But we don't know anything about producer Alex.  So let's start there.  Who is producer Alex?    Alex Perryman: Well, producer Alex is Alex Perryman.  I went to Full Sail University for audio engineering.  So I come from a music background.  So this is a little different for me.  But audio is audio [Laughs].    Dan Huot: I almost feel like we should caveat Alex has the coolest life ever, so strap in.    Alex Perryman: [Laughs] Yeah, the strap in.  It's not as extravagant as Dan is making it seem.    Dan Huot: Yea, now live up to that.    Alex Perryman: Gary Jordan: Yeah, yeah, thanks, no pressure here.  But I just -- you know, I have some pretty cool friends, know some cool people.    Host: Wow.  Okay, I won't just leave it.  Do you want to talk about who it is or you want to just leave it there and remain --    Alex Perryman: Well, I mean, I do know some Grammy-award winning producers and engineers in the music industry.  So it's kind of cool to have those as your Facebook friends so they can brag all day on Facebook about working with Beyonce here recently, which was what I saw.    Host: What?    Alex Perryman: And so -- yeah [Laughs].    Host: Man, you got the connections.    Alex Perryman: Oh, yeah.    Host: So wait, you were into music first, what kind of music were you doing?    Alex Perryman: Any kind.  It didn't really matter as long as it had a beat.    Host: That's really good music, then.    Alex Perryman: Yeah, there you go.    Host: All right.  So what's some of the favorite music that you've actually produced?    Alex Perryman: I do a lot of music for games personally.  So I love doing, like, gaming music and driving music.  Not the, you know, elevator music that will put you to sleep, but the music, like, \"Oh, I'm on a road trip.  It sounds like I'm on a road trip,\" that type of music.    Host: [Laughs] All right.  So Dan added that you have one of the coolest jobs ever; what is it that you're doing here, here at NASA?    Alex Perryman: So here at NASA, outside of being the audio wizard for the podcast, I work with the ISS on a lot of their live in-flight events.  I'm the voice that gets to talk to them at the end of the live event.  So I say my one awesome line and then I sign off.  But it's cool because it's heard in space.  So I get to go bed at night knowing that.    Host: Let's do it here, what's the line?    Alex Perryman: Station, this is Houston ACR.  That concludes the event.     [ Applause ]     [ Multiple Speakers ]    Dan Huot: Literally chills right now.  It might be because the room's 30 degrees.     [ Laughter ]    Host: That is the voice, that's awesome.  So you're constantly -- like, you're doing events, and your voice is in space.  And you have -- I mean, the audio control room, I've been there before, it's awesome.  It's so cool.    Alex Perryman: It's like a spaceship.    Host: It is, you're getting feeds from space all the time.  You actually get to communicate to and from -- well, to space, right?    Alex Perryman: Yeah.    Host: This concludes the event.  Right?    Alex Perryman: Yeah, I don't get to communicate from space.  That would be cool, though, if I could go up there and just end the event there, that would be nice.     [ Laughter ]    Host: Just float by the camera, right?    Alex Perryman:  Yeah.    Host: That concludes the event.  [Laughs] All right, Dan, you have been on the podcast.  You were the first guest I had.  We kind of sat down for episode one, and it wasn't -- actually, it wasn't planned to be episode one when we first did it.  It was, like, let's just see how podcasts could go.    Dan Huot: Yeah, we set bar low.    Host: [Laughs] And I was host and you were the guest.  And we talked about the International Space Station and just had a conversation.  And I think it's the most popular episode, I think, to this day.    Dan Huot: That sounds about right.  [Laughs] You know, I remember after we finished walking out and thinking, \"Man, that was so much fun.\"  Because at the end of the day our job is to talk about space.  And that was -- hey, Dan, sit in front of his microphone and talk about space for 45 minutes to an hour and don't shut up the entire time because that's what we actually want.  And that was fantastic.  It was such a blast to do.  And I still don't listen to too many podcasts, but I can tell you making them has been a lot of fun.    Host: Yeah.     [ Music ]  It has been described as one of the greatest engineering feats in human history.    Dan Huot: Not to toot our own horn, but we would certainly -- I would certainly argue that building a football-sized million-pound spacecraft in space is definitely up there.    Host: Yeah.     [ Music ]  Oh, yeah.  I listen to a ridiculous amount of podcasts.  That's actually how it got started, is I moved up to the city and my commute -- well, you know, my commute started when I was really close to here, in Clear Lake to NASA I was 15 minutes.  So that was --    Alex Perryman: Lucky.    Host: Yeah, just -- yeah, right?  Turn on the music or whatever.  It doesn't have to be anything -- I did listen to my own music, but it could be the radio because it's really, really short.  But when your commute goes up to an hour both ways, you know, you need to fill that time.  So I just started listening to podcasts because there's so many of them.  And obviously the first thing you do if you work at the Johnson Space Center is, like, what kind of space podcasts are out there?  So you start looking.  And NASA had a few, but they weren't, like, I don't know, podcasts, right?    Alex Perryman: They were more like shows just put in audio.    Host: Highlight shows almost.  So, like, two-minute recaps.  So I thought -- I was like, \"We should make one.\"  I think the only one at the time was NASA in Silicon Valley.  That was the only true podcast.  Everything else was just, like, highlights or they took space-to-ground and they just took the audio from it, the two-minute highlight show that we do every week.  And I was like, \"I bet you we could do this.\"  So I researched the industry and found out that lots of people listen to podcasts.  Who knew, right?  This industry is enormous.  It's been growing exponentially every single year.  So I thought it was almost prudent for us to enter into that space.  And here we are.  It took us a while to actually get off the ground just because we had to -- we had to build it from scratch and I had to figure out how to do a podcast, how to create weekly content, and how to make sure we did everything right.  Because NASA has a particular way of doing things.   We got to go out through NASA.gov versus any other sort of podcast feed or anything.  But yeah, so that's kind of how it --    Dan Huot: And we had to explain what a podcast was to a lot of people.    Host: Yeah, yeah, that was a huge part of it, was I had to research the industry and come up with statistic and present to management and say, \"We should do this.\"    Dan Huot: But then it was all the fun stuff.  What are we going to call it?  What is it going look like?    Host: [Laughs] What are we going to call it was fun.  Do you remember us coming up with the huge list of names?    Alex Perryman: Oh my gosh.    Host: It was enormous.  And it was actually Kelly Humphreys who came up with Houston, We Have a Podcast.  So props to him.    Dan Huot: Knocked it out of the park.    Host: Yeah.    Alex Perryman: [Multiple speakers] perfect.    Dan Huot: Because coming up with the name, it's almost like you hear it and you're like, \"Dibs, band name,\" because it's so hard to come up with something that just sounds almost natural.  You always do the test, like, \"Hey, did you listen to insert X hear last week?\"  And that was, I think, the first or really the only one that got pitched that it was like, \"Yep, that's it.\"    Host: That's the one [Laughs].    Dan Huot: Lock it down.    Host: Honestly, at that point there was no other options.    Dan Huot: No.    Host: It was just -- it was too perfect.    Dan Huot: Yeah.    Host: And originally to hear.  Well, actually, it was Houston, we've had a problem I think is the original quote.  But we couldn't say we've had a podcast because we have one.  We have one right now.     [ Laughter ]  So we had to do that.  All right, Dan, I want to know a little bit more about your background.  How did you get here to NASA?    Dan Huot: I was poor and I needed money.     [ Laughter ]    Alex Perryman: Join the club.    Dan Huot: No, so that is kind of the genesis of it.  I was in school, I was in college still and my roommate and I were sitting around.  And we had just gotten done with week three of eating hotdogs bought in bulk.  And we were like, \"We should probably try and make some money.\"  So we figured let's go get internships.  And so thankfully I went to school that had a really well-set up student employment program where -- a co-op program where I walked in and was immediately presented with a list of companies.  And they said, \"Pick which ones you want and you'll get an interview.\"  And I was like, \"Oh, that's easy.\"  And NASA was on the list.  And I was a business major in school.  So my first thought was, \"What the heck am I going to do at NASA?\"  I went to school with nothing but engineers.  So I was constantly reminded I am not an engineering.  And so then I saw this and I was like, \"Why would I go to NASA?\"  And they said, \"No, they're just like any other engineering company even where you still have business functions.  You can go do budget and contracts.\"   And that didn't sound super exciting, but it was NASA, so I said, \"Yeah, sign me up.\"  So I interviewed and I got the position.  So I came in as an intern, as a student, and I spent an entire semester in a budget office.  To put it lightly, it was not for me.  I knew that pretty quickly.  But since it was a co-op program that NASA still does -- name drop for the co-op program if you're a student; go apply because it's incredible -- you get to come back for multiple tours.  And they always told us try to get outside your comfort zone, see what else the center has to offer.  And I said, well, I always loved writing.  I liked talking.  Let me go see if I can go do public affairs.  That sounds like fun.  So they brought me in.  It was super intimidating.  They made me do a writing test and, you know, we need to see if you're up to snuff.  Pat's laughing at me.  [Laughs] But I passed.  And I got to come out, and I was a student.  And I mean, I came out, we were still flying Shuttle at the time.   And so I spent a summer in public affairs and it was during -- STS-125 was the first Shuttle mission that I vividly remember.  And that was -- Pat was probably doing commentary.  You were doing Orbit 2.  So that means Pat was one of the people in mission control, you know, giving live in on orbit 2.  So that was the exciting one probably when they were doing space walks and stuff.  So that mission was the last time we fixed Hubble.  And that was the last time we did space walks out of the Shuttle airlock.  So it was a really exciting mission.  There was a big IMAX movie that was made out of it.  I mean, it was incredible.  And that got me hooked.  And then I just kept coming back and refused to leave [Laughs].  And thankfully, they offered me a job by the time I graduated.  So it worked out.    Host: That's true.  That's one of the good things about the co-op program, right, as long as you do refuse to leave, you keep coming back --    Dan Huot: Chances are good.    Host: -- your chances are pretty good.    Dan Huot: That you might be here at NASA.    Alex Perryman: He's got to weigh them down a little bit, it's all right.     [ Laughter ]    Host: You know, that was actually -- that was my thing, too.  I started off as a business major myself.  And I knew pretty early I wanted to do marketing.  So I joined the marketing association.  And I loved films, so I was making a bunch of, like, commercials and stuff for the marketing association.  But I was having sort of a, I don't know, some moment where I was kind of second-guessing myself that maybe marketing wasn't for me.  And so I was thinking about switching to supply chain.  And the career fair was coming up for my sophomore year, and I decided not to go.  So I went to my morning classes.  And it was college, so I went to my morning classes and I was done by, like, 10:30 [Laughs].  I went to home and I changed and just sat on the couch.  And I was watching TV.    Alex Perryman: Very productive.    Host: Very productive, yeah.  I was a good student.    Dan Huot: Career fair, future?  Nah.  TV.    Host: Yeah, right.  And so two of my friend, Nick Penos [assumed spelling] and Chris Walton busted into my door, both suits, and they say, \"Gary, what are you doing?\"  [Laughs] And I go, \"Nothing.  That's what I'm doing.\"  And they said, \"Get your suit on, print out your resume, and come to the career fair.\"  And I was like, \"I don't really want to go.\"  And they said, \"But you're going.\"  And I said, \"Okay, fine.\"    Alex Perryman: Peer pressure.    Host: Yeah, right.  So I went to the career fair.  And they printed out my name, and it said business administration on it because I didn't even declare my major yet because I was only a sophomore.  I had my resume in hand and just everything that I was doing with the Penn State marketing association.  And I circled the career fair.  It was in the Bryce Jordan Center of Penn State, which is just a big -- it's their basketball stadium but it's a stadium and it was completely filled.  It was, like, one of the biggest career fairs.  So I just circled it and that took me an hour.  But I didn't see anything that really stuck out to me except for NASA.  Everything -- you know, because I was already second-guessing what I wanted to do.  But NASA had these banners that had, like, you know, people floating in the microgravity plane and working on robots.  And I was like, \"That looks cool.\"  And I was like, \"Well, I guess I'll just stand in line.\"  So I stood in line and so did a lot of other people.  And I was looking around at their badges and it said aerospace engineer, aerospace engineer, mechanical engineer, electrical engineer.  I'm like, \"I do not belong here.  What am I doing in this line?\"   And I was like, \"What do I have to lose?  I mean, I don't really want to interview with anyone else.\"  So I finally went up to the lady and I was just -- I mean, I had nothing to lose.  I was confident.  I said, \"Here's who I am, here's what I've done.  I make films.  I like marketing.  What do you have for me?\"  And they said, \"Oh, we have a public affairs office that we do -- you know, we make films and we broadcast live.  We write press releases and talk to the public and get them excited about space.\"  And I go, \"That looks fun.\"  So I came down here first semester, Public Affairs Office, sold.  Refused to leave.  Kept coming back [Laughs].  And here I am.  Yeah.    Dan Huot: So I would say shameless plug for Gary: He's responsible for one of the most viewed NASA videos of all time.    Host: Yes [Laughs].  That's right, NASA Johnson Style.     [ Music ]    Host:  NASA Johnson Style.    Host: That was my first co-op video project.  We just, I don't know -- Gangam Style was a hit at the time.  So we were like, \"We can make a parody of this.\"  And so yeah, we went through and I went behind the camera, directed it, edited it, and yeah, made it into this great, fun video.  And people are trying to beat the view count on that ever since.    Dan Huot: I just love we have people launching on rockets, gorgeous views of outer space, stuff you can't get anywhere else, but our best thing is NASA Johnson Style.  Which I think just speaks to the quality of that video, Gary.    Host: Thanks, Dan.  Thanks.  Yeah -- no that was --    Alex Perryman: You really know your audience.    Host: Yeah, I do.  That's what people -- give people what they want, you know?  It was good.  That was really fun.  I love making videos like that.  So that was my thing, as long as I can keep doing fun things.  And, you know, that was another reason I wanted to create the podcast is this is fun.  I get to sit down and have conversations with good people and then you guys, too [Laughs].    Alex Perryman: Thanks.    Dan Huot: Oh, feel the love right there.  My best to you guys.    Host: Yeah -- no, but just really -- I mean, astronauts, engineers.  I mean, just you hear these stories, and they get so passionate about what they're talking about.  And honestly, we can easily make this into a three, four, five-hour podcast episode, but it's just, you know, you got to think about who's listening.  But, I mean, it's just amazing to talk to these people.  So we already started with episode one.    Dan Huot: Well, clearly that was the best.    Host: Clearly that was the best.    Alex Perryman: That was the best.    Dan Huot: And it's been all downhill from there.     [ Laughter ]    Host: Yeah -- no, but that was good.  Because a fun thing about that episode is the first, I think, four minutes of the episode were cut.   Dan Huot: Was terrible.    Host: Because we didn't really know how to start a podcast.    Alex Perryman: Yeah.    Dan Huot: We tried to be witty.  We're not witty.    Host: Yeah, we tried to be witty and funny, and you're right, it was awful.  So yeah, the first three minutes are cut and we just got right into the good stuff there.  And then we went ever since.  It was pretty awesome.  The next episode was 2017 astronaut class.  I think we selected the class in June, first episode of the podcast came out in July.  So naturally it was just -- it was a hot topic at the time.  Brand new class, 12 new astronauts with great personalities.  And I got 20 minutes with them.  Twenty minutes with 12 astronauts.  So there was no way I was going to be able to interview them.  I mean, if you do the math, I don't even get two minutes with each one of them.  So I was like, \"Okay, I got to do something fun.\"  So we played two truths and a lie.  We played a game.    Alex Perryman: It was awesome.    Host: It was so fun.  And, you know, it was kind of a roll of the dice, too, because you have no idea how they're going to -- you know, they might engage, they might not.  But they were just a fantastic, fantastic group of people and engaged real fast.     [ Music ]    Robb Kulin:  All right.  So inspected a rocket booster while I had liquid oxygen on board.  Skied off the summit of Denali wearing a superman cape.  I went rock climbing with a broken ankle while wear an astronaut helmet.    Host:  Oh.    >> That was the second one?   Robb Kulin:  Skied off the summit of Denali wear a Superman cape.    >> I'll go with that one.    >> Yeah, I'd go with that.    Robb Kulin:  You guys are too easy.     [ Laughter ]    Host: So what kind of cape was it?    Robb Kulin:   That was the lie.    Host: What was the last one again?    Robb Kulin:  I went rock climbing with a broken ankle while wearing an astronaut helmet.    Host: Why?     [ Laughter ]    >> Why not?    Robb Kulin:  I didn't realize it was broken.  I just kept [inaudible].     [ Laughter ]    Robb Kulin:  So one of those padded astronaut helmets like you see in the costume store.  And my buddy's [inaudible] like we go climbing, having some sort of gag with you, whether it be some sort of silly costume, I guess.  And that day it was the astronaut helmet.     [ Music ]    Host: But I got to talk to Anne Roemer, too, on just the selection process and how difficult it is.  Because, you know, I think we in public affairs are partially responsible, but it was really -- it was a large effort.  But we really drove the application process really hard.  And [Laughs] the poor folks that had to go throughout application process --    Alex Perryman: I almost applied.    Host: Really?    Alex Perryman: Yeah, I was convinced.  I was like, \"I might can do this.\"     [ Laughter ]    Dan Huot: I think -- what was it -- 18,000 people applied, which was a record, and 12 got selected.    Host: Twelve.    Dan Huot: Which, when you look at the resumes for those 12 --    Host: It made sense.    Dan Huot: It makes a lot of sense.  [Laughs] It kind of makes you question what you've done with your life because they're just -- overachiever doesn't even start just because they've already done so much and now they're astronauts or now they're going to be restaurants.  It's -- it's insane.  So yeah, getting to play two truths and a lie with them -- that was a treat.    Host: I know.  That's funny.  Yeah, I mean, reading their resumes was insane because we did get to -- and Me and You Shared This was actually interviewing them on Skype before they came.  They were all stationed.  They haven't come to the Johnson Space Center yet to begin all the event.  But we were interviewing them, and it was just fantastic to read through their resumes.  And here I am telling stories about me sitting on the couch and not going to a career fair.  And I'm reading these guys and I'm like, \"My gosh, I really need to go back to school.\"    Dan Huot: That was so much fun, though.  That wasn't a podcast thing.  But as a random aside that was really cool because we got to talk to these people right after they got a phone call everybody wishes they could get in their life.  Like hey, \"Want to come be an astronaut?\"     [ Laughter ]  Let me think about it, no -- yes.  And so we got to talk to those people, you know, within days or a week of them finding out.  That was -- you could feel the emotion.    Alex Perryman: It was nice.  Like, you're smiling, they're smiling.  Everyone's just happy.    Dan Huot: Yeah, we're all just so happy together.     [ Laughter ]  Yeah.    Host: It was really exciting.  And it was well-timed, too.  That was the very next episode, actually, was good timing.  Shane Kimbrough came back.  He had just landed from space.  He flew back and was here the very next day.  And then the very next day after that, I got to interview him about how that landing experience -- so it was, like, as fresh as you could possibly make it for Here and Houston, like, we got to hear him talking about coming down from space.  And I was -- I only got ten minutes, but man, it was --    Alex Perryman: It was a nice ten minutes.    Host: It was, it was really good.     [ Music ]    Shane Kimbrough:  Oh yeah.  No doubt.    Host: How did that feel?    Shane Kimbrough:   I've heard it called, like, a really bad car crash, and now I can confirm that that is accurate.    Host: Wow.    Shane Kimbrough:   So you hit just really hard.  In our case we hit twice really hard.    Host: Oh.  And then you rolled around?    Shane Kimbrough:   And then we rolled some more, too, just for added effects.     [ Music ]    Host: I just -- I felt bad because I had, like, a script of questions that I needed to ask him.    Alex Perryman: You asked him about food.    Host: I asked him about food, of course.  But I forgot to ask him how he was feeling until the very end of my questioning.  I was like, \"Oh my gosh, that should be question number one: Man, how are you doing?  You just came back from space, are you feeling good?\"  But he was, he was talking about he was already back at the gym day two, you know?  Already back and starting to recondition himself.  So just to hear what these guys do.  And, again, I'm on the couch.  You know?  Just saying.  How about you guys?  I mean, I'm just going through episodes one through three, but do you guys have a favorite episode?    Dan Huot: Live from Space.    Host: Oh my -- how did [Laughs].    Dan Huot: We're not all is equally blessed as Alex to where we get to talk to space all the time.  It's kind of a rare occurrence for the rest of humanity.  And so when we got to talk to Jack Fischer, who -- my all-time favorite astronaut --    Alex Perryman: Yeah, that guy's awesome.    Dan Huot: -- we got to talk to him in space, that was pretty surreal.    Host: That was.  And that one was -- we did it live.  The whole thing was live.  We did a video.  So we actually get to see -- we had a special set for the podcast.  And, you know, we had this open air where me and you were kind of telling stories about who he is, and you told the stories the first time you met.  It's just, like, we know he's going to be engaging because he's just in the past has just been incredibly fun to listen to and he comes up with crazy stuff.  And right up front he goes, \"By the way, for every question you ask me, I'm going to switch walls.\"    Alex Perryman: Yeah.    Host: And so if you take snapshots from that episode, every single snapshot will probably be him on a different position, wall, orientation.    Alex Perryman: Just bouncing around like Spiderman.  It was awesome.    Host: It was so fun.     [ Music ]    Jack Fischer:  It's awesome like it is every day.  And what I was going to do just because, you know, it is your first guest from space, every single question I'm going to go on a different, you know, wall.  So I'll be on the walls, I'll be on the ceiling.  I'm going to -- I'm going to adjust orientation mid-interview at every question just because I can and it's cool.     [ Music ]    Host: We got to do it again -- not with you the next time, Dan, but we did it with Megan Sumner and I got to talk to four astronauts.  And that was --    Alex Perryman: Yeah, photography, right?    Host: About photography.  And it was great because all of them were really passionate about that stuff.    Alex Perryman: Oh, yeah.    Host: Paolo Nespoli actually took the red camera and pointed it outside and he was talking about taking 4K footage of the Earth, which we obviously love.  And then they actually took [Laughs] -- pulled out camera and started taking snapshots just randomly of the event.  But it was just awesome.  They were all fully engaged, all four of them.  It was -- yeah, it was Nespoli, Mark Vande Hei, Joe Acaba, and Randy Bresnik.     [ Music ]    Paolo Nespoli: Yes, so we do have -- for still photography, we essentially have a Nikon camera.  Right now we have several D4.  Each one of us gets his own, plus we have a couple placed strategically.  Some of them are dedicate for special photography like macrophotography.  We need to do a lot of macrophotography for equipment here.     [ Music ]    Alex Perryman: That episode that I really liked was Rocket on a Rocket.    Host: Oh, yeah.    Alex Perryman: Like, I feel like if there's ever an episode that I can quote to people to make myself feel as smart as other people feel that I need to be since I work at NASA, a Rocket on a Rocket is my go-to episode.  Because that's where things clicked like, from, like, you know, the catchy -- oh, it's a rocket on a rocket.  Really, we're talking about launch/abort system.  I was like, \"Oh my gosh, I get it.  I get it.  I can make [inaudible] references, I'm smart.\"    Host: Yeah [Laughs].    Alex Perryman: I love that episode.    Host: Wahab was such a great guest, too.  Because I asked him up front during the podcast, I said, \"You know, I want to call this a rocket on a rocket.\"  I was like, \"Is that fair, is that accurate?\"  He's like, \"You know, when I saw that, when you sent the script to me,\" he's like, \"I thought about it and yes, absolutely.  It is definitely a rocket on a rocket.\"  But it's just so funny because it's, like, his world.  But I don't think he would have called it a rocket on a rocket.  You know, he thinks about the launch/abort.  He's into the intricate details.  But if you pull back, yes, if you're launching on a rocket, this is something that is a rocket that will launch, like, from a speeding rocket.  It's crazy.  That one is -- it was definitely one of my favorite conversations, too because he did such a good job of describing of, like, how it all works.  And you're right.    Alex Perryman: I think that's the reason why it clicked with me so much.  And so I'm, like, walking around, I hear people talking about him like, \"Oh, you're talking about a Rocket on a Rocket?\"  And they're like what?  And I was like, \"Oh, no.  It's fine.\"  I'm right.  It's fine.    Host: Oh, yeah.     [ Music ]    Wahab Alshahin:  When you told me that you were trying to call it a rocket on a rocket, I thought about that, and then I thought about the specifications for what this thing actually does.    Host: Yeah.    Wahab Alshahin:   It's 30 feet tall, it produces 400,000 pounds-plus of thrust.  That is basically -- at that point, yes, that is a rocket that is sitting on top of an even larger rocket.  Yeah.  So certainly that's a fair assessment.     [ Music ]    Host: I think when we first started this, I was kind of -- I was kind of up in the air of how popular it was going to get, you know?  How many people are going to listen to this?  But it just so happened that, you know, like you said, July is when it first came out.  August was when the total eclipse over America --    Alex Perryman: Oh yeah.    Host: -- was coming across.  And that was such a huge event for NASA.  For those of you who don't know, I mean, the total solar eclipse went across the United States and only across the United States, right?  It was only in totality within US territory.  And, like, we just blew it up, right?  We turned it into this huge event.  We went across the country and just sort of did live coverage.  NASA.gov exploded in terms of viewership.  Unmatched viewership.  Like, we totally shattered any record of NASA.gov traffic before that.  It just so happened that Houston, We Have a Podcast was -- had a total solar eclipse episode that was on the front page of NASA.gov whenever the total solar eclipse was coming.  So that gave us a real nice boost.    Alex Perryman: Oh, yeah.    Host: And that was a good conversation, too.  I mean, he was an eclipse expert and came with this huge binder of material.  Do you remember that?    Alex Perryman: Yes.    Host: And he -- like, he actually had a setup right here.  But he turned to the side from the microphone and we gave him another table, and he spread out all of this information because he had so much he wanted to go over.  I barely got a question in because he was like, \"And the next thing I wanted to tell you.\"    Dan Huot: He was prepared.    Host: He was.  That was great.    Alex Perryman: But it was filled with really, really good information, especially the safety information, which was really nice.  I remember friends that listened to that, they were that saying oh, they didn't know they can't just go out there and look at it in normal sunglasses.  It's probably not a good idea.  But listening to the podcast, they can.     [ Music ]    Host: All it.  Let's do it.  However you want to start.    Mark Matney:  Let's talk about safety a little bit.    Host: Okay, safety.    Mark Matney:  Everybody has heard don't look at an eclipse, you'll go blind, right?  We've all heard that.    Host: Yeah.    Mark Matney:  And I remember as a boy puzzling and puzzling over that.  What is it about an eclipse that makes it so dangerous?  Well, is turns out you don't want to stare at the sun ever.     [ Music ]    Dan Huot: Did you guys actually get to see the eclipse, though?  Or were you here in Houston?    Host: I was here in Houston, so I only saw part of it.    Alex Perryman: Yeah, I stepped out and I was just like okay.  Because we had -- I had -- we were live.  We were live on air.    Host: You went out, though, didn't you?    Dan Huot: I did.    Host: How was it?    Dan Huot: I abandoned my fellow NASA colleagues and I went to [inaudible].  So I think Houston was about 70% or so?    Alex Perryman: Yeah, it was pretty decent.    Dan Huot: It looked like -- well, you say that, but you're wrong.     [ Laughter ]  Because it probably got a little bit shady or something maybe.    Host: Actually, no the sky -- I mean, if you really paid attention maybe.  But, like, it looked pretty much the same.    Alex Perryman: I only saw it for, like, 20 seconds and I had to run back upstairs.    Host: Well, I put on my glasses and I could tell.  But, like, you know, the sky kind of looked the same to me.    Dan Huot: So I went on a trip to the middle of nowhere in Kentucky.  And this is going to be kind of a long aside, but I think it's worth it because if you have the chance to see a total solar eclipse, drop what you're doing and go somewhere where you can watch it.  Because, I mean, I've seen rocket launches, I've seen Soyuz landings, you know, all this crazy stuff -- that was one of the coolest things I've ever seen in my entire life.    Host: Wow.    Dan Huot: I went with a group of friends out to the middle of nowhere.  I got a bunch of really nerdy friends who calculated, you know, exactly where it will have the longest viewing point and they narrowed it down using maps to this cornfield in this, you know, very small town in Kentucky.  And we showed up and a guy had already rented out a farmer's cornfield, gave the farmer $1,000 and didn't let anybody else come on the cornfield with him.  So we were right across the street in somebody's front yard.  But it's this really surreal experience where it -- colors start to change all around you.  And this is -- it gets a little bit darker and a little bit darker.  And there's this moment where all of the bugs -- you didn't realize but there's bugs and there's just noise and everything -- it all just went completely silent.  And it was totally eerie and kind of freaky.  And then when it actually goes into totality and you can finally take the glasses off and just stare at the sun safely, it's -- it's weird.   It's weird.  It's really hard to describe, but it's -- it's a totally cool moment.  It's a primal moment where you almost automatically start thinking, you know, what did people hundreds and thousands of years ago that this happened, look up at the sky and think the world was ending?  Because you almost get that feeling.  Like, this should not be happening.     [ Laughter ]  And then it lasts a couple of minutes.  And then it's done.  And we have another one coming up in 2024, I think?    Host: Yeah.    Alex Perryman: That's going to actually come through Houston, isn't it?    Host: I think it's more Austin, San Antonio.    Dan Huot: It will come through Texas, but it will come across the US again.  So anybody listening, start making plans for 2024.  Go out and see the total solar eclipse, you will not regret it.    Host: And I think that one's suppose to be longer totality.  I think yours was only, like, two minutes; I think this one's, like, four -- close to four or something.    Dan Huot: So it will be twice as cool.    Host: Yeah, yeah.  That just sounds surreal.  I think that was one of the stories was, like, two armies were, like, about to battle, and then a total solar -- this is, like, hundreds of years ago.  I'm going to butcher this story, by the way, because I don't really know all the details.    Dan Huot: Just start making up random fantastical stuff.    Host: Yeah.  But so total solar eclipse happened.  And they kind of looked up, the total solar eclipse passed, and they canceled the battle.  Like, \"Oh, that's a sign.  We're not going to fight today.\"  I wish I knew more information about that story.  But yeah -- no, it sounds surreal.    Dan Huot: This story brought to you by Garypedia.    Host: Yeah [Laughs].    Alex Perryman: I love it.    Host: So the very next -- the very next one after eclipse, this one was fun, was when Styx came.    Alex Perryman: Oh, yeah.    Host: Yeah.  They were on tour and they had a free day.  So we coordinated to bring them here on site.  And I helped out with the tour just like we do for many VIP tours.  But they actually sat down and we had a conversation.  And that was definitely one of my favorite conversations.  Because we just brought two members of Styx and then two I'll call them exploration experts.  Like, they actually study what it takes to go explore the cosmos.  And we talked about just that, you know?  So if we were to land on Mars, what kind of things will we need or the -- Styx was asking questions.  They were fully engaged.  We were talking about going to Mars, we talked about going out to Pluto and selfishly to the moon of Pluto, Styx.  You know?  Like, what would that even look like?  Just like these -- these kind of weird concepts of yeah, so if we did go out to the sort of Kuiper Belt are, like, what would a human mission kind of look like?   The answer would be very difficult.  But yeah, we had the experts there and actually had a fantastic conversation.    Alex Perryman: I ended up getting a guitar pick --    Host: Really?    Alex Perryman: -- as a gift.  And that was exciting.  I still have it.     [ Laughter ]    Host: Really?  That's so great.  Yeah, that was -- that was definitely one of my favorite episode for sure.  Because we sat -- it was different because we have -- right now we're kind of in a -- it's the three of us, right?  And we have this circular stables we have mics at three of us.  But this one we just sort of sat and you set up some booms, like, around.  And we just sat in a circle.    Alex Perryman: It was six people.    Host: Yeah, six people, right?  And we sat in a circle and just had a conversation.  And it was awesome.  We got another one coming up soon here where we're going to do that again.  But yeah, I mean, I love that kind of -- where everyone can just chime in.  Because you can tell it was kind of a rocky start because everyone's just kind of like, \"What is this going to look like?\"  And then eventually I couldn't get anyone to shut up, you know?  So it was great.     [ Music ]     [ Inaudible ]    Tommy Shaw:  If you were going to vacation and you were in the area, you'd go to Pluto and you'd take some snapshots.    Host: Yeah, see it from the surface.    Lawrence Gowan:  I don't know, I think with a little work, we could buff it up and make it a holiday destination.    Tommy Shaw:  It's a fixer-upper.  There's no doubt about it.    Lawrence Gowan:  Handyman's dream.    John Connolly:  It's about the size of downtown, Chicago, by the way.    Lawrence Gowan:  Is it?    Glenn Lutz: Yeah, it's not too big.    John Connolly:  Yeah, it's not that big.    Lawrence Gowan:  Chicago's nice.  [Laughs]    John Connolly:  Yeah, yeah.    Glenn Lutz:  A frozen Chicago.     [ Multiple Speakers ]     [ Music ]    Dan Huot: Did you guys do an episode during Harvey?    Alex Perryman: Gary did, yeah.    Host: So [Laughs] it was funny -- well, I wouldn't say funny because I couldn't get here.    Alex Perryman: Yeah.  Me, either.  I was in Dallas.    Host: Yeah, NASA was straight up closed.  And I live right off of Buffalo Bayou.  So when Harvey hit, it's kind of this river and all the floodgates dump into this river.  And so the floodgates got filled up.  So they let them loose on Buffalo Bayou.  And the whole thing flooded to levels I've never seen.  It's flooded once before since I've lived there, but not to this level.  And so the road that I usually take to get to NASA was completely under water.  So I wasn't going anywhere.  At that time, I mean, it wasn't long that we had started the podcast.  It was only, like, two months or something.  But was like -- I think it's appropriate to say something about it because just to acknowledge that this is happening.  So a couple days afterwards the levels started going down and people were kind of all over the streets just checking out the area because everything had been under water for two, three straight days.  And so I just kind of recorded, like, an update, just like, \"Here's what happened, guys.  A lot of things happened.  People lost their lives within Houston.   And, you know, a lot of people were affected, especially, you know, homes in one way or another,\" and just sort of just acknowledge that.  But I went out with a -- I had a portable audio recorder, my own personal one.  And I just recorded -- I wrote a script and printed out an update.  I mean, it was really hard to work, you know?    Alex Perryman: Yeah.    Host: Just because everyone was out of commission pretty much.  But I figured this was the right thing to do.  So I actually walked across the bridge to Buffalo Bayou and I recorded it on the bridge.  I was right -- and the water was right underneath me.  And the sidewalks -- where it was supposed to be the sidewalks were completely under water right next to me but I was on the bridge.  And I recorded it right there on Buffalo Bayou, so I recorded it outside.  But it was just, like, a two-minute update.  But I could successfully say that we never missed a week.    Alex Perryman: We did not, not even for a hurricane.    Host: That's right, we never missed a week.  That was crazy.     [ Music ]    Host: But if there's one good thing that came out of this disaster, it's learning that Houston is full of some incredible people and spaceship Earth is not such a bad place to live.  Local first responders and Coast Guard were helping those in need, and even Texas civilians grabbed their trucks and boats to aid in these efforts.  At NASA's Johnson Space Center's flight controllers braved the weather and camped out in mission control 24/7 to made sure the crew members aboard the International Space Station were safe and well.     [ Music ]  I think another thing was, you know, we had a lot of the changes just throughout the whole -- the whole time that we were here for a year.  We had -- first we were in Studio B, remember that?    Alex Perryman: Yes, the other studio.    Host: And the podcast setup was interesting.    Dan Huot: Where it was warmer.    Alex Perryman: It was warmer, but it was louder.    Host: But, you know, because we had never started a podcast before, we had very limited equipment.  We have these mics.  But actually, I can see the table right now.  It's this really small wooden table.  And we just clamped the mics to the side of that table.  There's barely enough room for two pieces of paper.  And we had our conversations in the back of Studio B because it was next to some sound buffers or something.  But I think we did a couple episodes there and they turned out okay, but the fan --    Alex Perryman: It just got ridiculous.    Host: Yeah, it got ridiculous.    Alex Perryman: The summer and it was trying to cool everything off.    Host: Yeah, I mean, it started getting a little bit annoying.    Alex Perryman:  It would just kick on randomly and it's like, \"Well, I hope we're done with this episode.\"     [ Laughter ]    Host: So that's -- that's when we went so the sound booth.    Alex Perryman: Yeah, it was a little bit warmer, cozy.    Dan Huot: Cozy's the operative word.    Host: You did a couple in there.    Dan Huot: Yeah, I did a couple in there, which I didn't mind it too much.  But I don't know if it's just me, but you almost start to get uncomfortable when you're in a sound booth after a while.    Alex Perryman: Yeah, it's just -- because it's totally quiet.    Dan Huot: It's too quiet.    Host: Yeah.  I mean, the levels are great, but the way our sound booth is situated, you got this big desk at the corner, right?  And we have interpreters sit there and they're looking at the screen And they have all their papers out.  It makes sense.  But for a conversation where you have to turn your head for the whole -- I mean, the mic is over here, you have to turn your head, I mean, the sound was bouncing everywhere.    Alex Perryman: There's a giant window.    Host: It was already pretty tight.  So now we're doing it in Studio A. And I want to bigger table.  This is a nice table right higher.    Alex Perryman: We're getting there.  We're slowly moving up.  It's a little cold in here, but it will even out.    Host: That's why for all of our guest now whenever we invite them, I'm like, \"Bring a jacket.\"     [ Laughter ]    Dan Huot: Trust me.    Host: But it's July.  I was like, \"Bring a jacket.\"    Alex Perryman: You'll want a jacket.  And you'll want July heat when you leave out of here.    Host: Oh.  Dan, do you have any guests that sort of stick out whenever you think about the folks that you've actually sat down and you've interviewed?    Dan Huot: A couple.    Host: Yeah?    Dan Huot: Probably the three most recent ones -- well, three of the most recent ones that I did which were in the booth.  I got to talk to Drew and Ricky before their flights.  And those were really cool.  Drew has this crazy, elaborate, reaching back to the early 1900 story of how he got to where he got.  And that was really cool to hear.  And then Ricky Arnold has taught in schools all over the planet and just shared his experience of what it was like getting off the plane for the first time in Morocco as a 20-something and just being --    Alex Perryman: Yeah, international band.    Dan Huot: Yeah, totally fish out of water in all these different places.  It's always cool to talk to an astronaut.    Host: Oh, yeah.    Dan Huot: Because they all have these super diverse, super unique backgrounds.  They'll have some of the same resume things, like, a lot of them are pilots or something.  But just the path that they took to become that is always unique.  And it kind of helps you realize, you know, no matter where you're starting, this is where you can end up.    Host: Yeah.    Alex Perryman: Right.    Dan Huot: The other one I really liked was I talked to Scott Smith, the nutritionist.  And as somebody who as horrendous diet [Laughs] you never really think about just all of the different aspects of your health that what -- the food that you're putting into your body can affect.  And just the level of what they're tracking for the astronauts in space is unreal, that they're able to track all of these individual aspects of the food just to keep the crew members healthy.  And then the stuff he was talking about for the vision changes is really cool.  Because vision changes, for anybody that kind of follows along, that's one of the big kind of gremlins out there for what happens to humans in space that we have to solve before we, you know, send people on to Mars for three years.  And there's a lot of theories out there about why it's happening, but they've actually been finding this genetic reason that could potentially, you know, give us an advance warning that hey, you might be susceptible to this.   And it will have effects for people here on Earth because it's linked to another disease.  And all this crazy stuff.  And coming in, like, his title is he's a bio -- bio what is it?  Biochemical nutritionist or something.    Host: Yeah, yeah.    Dan Huot: Something of that nature.  You wouldn't normally expect from the title to sit there and learn about that, but that's what he's working on.    Host: Right.    Dan Huot: And that was eye-opening.    [00:47:40] [ Music ]    Scott Smith:  Changes in some of their hormones.  There's a list of about eight or nine things that we had that we found a clinical population that had the exact same set of characteristics.  And that is women with polycystic ovary syndrome.    Dan Huot: Really?    Scott Smith:  Really.  Polycystic ovary syndrome or PCOS as they call it is the leading cause of infertility in women.  It affects 10% to 20% of women which is a staggering incidence.     [ Music ]    Dan Huot: I'm jealous, though, you got to talk to Ginger.    Alex Perryman: Ginger is awesome.    Dan Huot: And Ginger is one of the coolest people on the face of the planet.    Host: You know, I mean, it would be a totally different story, but Alex and I were talking afterwards after we recorded that episode.  That was part of the Women's History Month episodes.  She was one of our four guests.  And I kind of wish we just -- the podcast, her segment was the 20 minutes, 25 minutes we spent after the podcast.    Alex Perryman: Yes.    Host: She was just -- first of all, her story -- I wish I included both, how about that?  Because her story was just incredible.  Just a roller coaster of emotion and start to finish, just incredible.  But oh yeah, afterwards it was so great because we put down -- we turned off the recording, right?    Alex Perryman: Yeah.    Host: And Ginger had actually attended because I say it's cold, but it's an audio podcast.  I was like, \"There's no specific attire.\"  She came in gym clothes.    Alex Perryman: Yeah.  She went straight to gym afterwards.    Host: She's like, \"I'm going to the gym right after this.  So this makes the most sense.\"  But we were just chatting and we were talking about -- like, she got an email notification while we were chatting, right?  And it was for a concert that was coming up.  And she's like, \"I really want to go to this concert.\"  And so she start texting her friend, \"Do you want to go with me?\"  And next thing you know, she's pulling up and she's buying tickets, right?    Alex Perryman: Yes.    Host: And then she's like, \"Have you heard of this artist before?\"  Like, I don't think -- and she's like, \"Oh, I love it.\"  And then she puts down her phone and we just start jamming for a couple minutes.    Alex Perryman: It's the best.    Host: It was great.    Alex Perryman: I was so mad I turned the recorder off.  I was like, \"I can't believe I did that.\"  I never turn it off when, like, normally I just keep it rolling and it's like I'll have buffer room at the end.  But I cut it off, and I don't know what I was thinking.    Dan Huot: Yeah.  She's one of the most, like, objectively cool people that you'll ever meet in your life.  But she's also insanely driven, insanely intelligent.    Host: Oh, yeah.    Dan Huot: And capable and was a flight director and all this crazy stuff.    Host: Yeah.    Dan Huot: And then she could sit there and introduce you to cool new bands.    Host: Yeah [Laughs].  Just super personable.  But yeah, her story was great.  And she never gave up.  She always just pushed forward.  It was an amazing story to hear.    Dan Huot: Go listen to Ginger's episode.    Host: Yeah.  That one was good, Stories of Her Strength is the name of the episode.    Alex Perryman:  Yes.     [ Music ]    Host:  Was it this goal that you had in the back of your mind that really helped you to kind of excel?  Because you graduated in the second of your class in high school, right?    Ginger Kerrick:   Yes, yes.  By one one thousandth of a point, not that I carry that with me to this day.  But --     [ Music ]    Host: You know, you were talking about Scott Smith, how -- you know, just learning his perspective and you're thinking about your own diet whenever you're thinking about nutrition.  And that was the same thing that happened whenever we had Andrea Hanson in here to talk about exercise.  That was a good one.  She talked about what the astronauts have to do to exercise and why they exercise, really to mitigate some of the bone and muscle loss that they have.  But I asked her, I was like, \"What do you take out of this?  Being a person, an expert, what are you taking out of this?\"  And she goes, \"Actually, because the folks on the ground are helping the astronauts so much, I have actually -- I actually have my own personal trainer because I realize how important that is.\"  It was an interesting perspective.  Because I was like, \"Huh, I wouldn't have thought that.\"  I thought it would have been a technique or a routine.  But it's, like, the whole personal trainer aspect.  She's like, \"I get that now.\"    Alex Perryman: That makes sense.    Host: Yeah, that makes sense to me.     [ Music ]    Andrea Hanson:  And so one thing I've taken away is I do hire a trainer to help me work out so that I'm make sure that I'm pushing myself and somebody's there to help keep me motivated along the way.     [ Music ]    Host: Poor Andrea, though, because that was the one where Greg -- oh my gosh.    Alex Perryman: The one time I take a vacation.    Host: Yeah, Alex took a vacation.  Where were you going?  You were actually speaking.    Alex Perryman: I was speaking at Full Sail University.  So I was -- I was down there for Hall of Fame Week.  And I got a lovely email from Greg [Laughs] explaining to me don't panic, I've handled it, but we're going to have to rerecord this podcast [inaudible].  We don't do that.  I mean, it's not live, but we get one take.    Host: But yeah -- no, that was -- the file came in corrupt the way that it was recorded.  That was another one we did in the sound booth.  And I felt so bad.  I was like, \"Andrea,\" I was like, \"You did a great job.\"    Alex Perryman: The odds of that happening are so slim.    Host: I know.    Dan Huot: You did so great, now come do it again.     [ Laughter ]    Host: So we had to rerecord the whole thing.  And she had no problems at all.  She was like, \"I understand, absolutely, thank you for coming.\"  She was really, really cool about it.    Alex Perryman: That's awesome.    Host: But that's not the only time that we've had a close call.  While that one was not even a close call, Greg just --    Dan Huot: That was a call.    Host: That was a call.    Alex Perryman: It was a call.  Close call was episodes being deleted that weren't released yet, close call.    Host: Oh, yeah.    Alex Perryman: That was --    Dan Huot: Who did that?  Gary.    Alex Perryman: Gary's like, \"Don't look at me.\"    Host: Don't look at me, I don't touch that.  Although I did have to record one episode.  I'll get to that after this story.    Alex Perryman: But yeah, so John was using our recorder for something.  And he reformatted the recorder.  I didn't know that he was going to reformat the recorder because we had just recorded an episode the day before and he wanted to use the recorder the next morning.  And I was like, \"Oh, that's fine.  I'll just pull the episodes off.\"  He's just going to record something.  I marked my numbers, I know where it's at.  I get the recorder back and I'm, like, \"Hey, John, did you pull everything?  Because there's nothing on it.\"  He's like, \"No, no, I reformatted it.\"  I was like, \"Oh.  Oh no.\"    Dan Huot: Oh, no.    Alex Perryman: And so I went panicking and it was -- I think it was, like, game two of NBA playoffs.  Throughout the entire game I literally have the recorder to some program trying to recover files.  And it took the entire game -- the entire Rockets game for it to find the files.  And it found them and I got the files back.  I'm still amazed that it happened.  I'm pretty sure that's where audio wizard comes from because that was pure magic.    Host: Yep, that is where it comes from.    Alex Perryman: The fact that every single file that we've ever record on there came back.  And that's hundreds of files.  And so I'm just, you know, I'm glad that software was there.  I would never like to go through that experience again.  I didn't know how to tell Gary.  Like, I was just sitting there because we recorded another episode, and I didn't want to tell him before the episode.  So I'm just sitting there look at him like, \"I am so sorry.\"    Dan Huot: Great job.  By the way, everything you did last week is completely gone.  Bye.    Host: Okay, bye.  Yeah, right?    Alex Perryman: I was like, \"Don't worry, I got a plan.  Hopefully this will work.\"    Host: Oh, actually, I don't think you told me until after you recovered them.    Alex Perryman: Yeah, that's right.  I did not tell him until after I recovered it.    Host: That was a smart move to do.    Alex Perryman: I just waited.  I was like, \"But I have the files now.  Don't worry [Laughs].\"    Host: That was the strategy I did with my mom whenever I went skydiving the first time.    Alex Perryman: There you go.    Host: I went skydiving, I went on the ground, and then I called my mom.  I was like, \"Mom, I went skydiving.\"  She's like, \"You did what?\"     [ Laughter ]  I was like, \"But I'm on the ground now, so you can't yell at me.\"  She's like, \"Oh, but I will.\"     [ Multiple Speakers ]  Some of the other folks that we have now.  So first of all, the shout-out to -- even though Greg lost that episode [Laughs] shout out --    Dan Huot: Not holding any grudges.    Host: Yeah, not holding any grudges, I definitely have forgiven him.  But he made the music for Houston, We Have a Podcast.  And that's great music.  The intro stuff?    Dan Huot: Oh, yeah.    Host: With the splashes of actual historical audio from missions -- really, really cool.  One small step for man, you know, he's got all that in there.  It's great.  Matt McKenzie, who actually was an intern for me back, oh my gosh, I think almost two years ago at this point.    Alex Perryman: Yes.    Host: It was two years ago.  Made the thumbnail.  So I'd like to thank him for that for sure.  And, you know, you were talking to Pat earlier.  Pat's off here to the side.  He's one of our new producers for Houston, We Have a Podcast, as well as Bill Stafford, who actually does all of the posting and --    Dan Huot: Click, click, click.    Host: Yeah, all that clicking.    Dan Huot: Taking awkward pictures of us [Laughs].    Host: So I'd like to thank them for joining the team.  Because for the longest time, I mean, Alex, it was pretty much just me and you just kind of running the show.    Alex Perryman: Yep.    Host: That was -- that was tough.  But yeah, here we are, 52 episodes later and a lot more to come.    Dan Huot: Pretty soon we'll get Pat to host one.    Host: That's right, the golden voice.    Dan Huot: Get that golden radio voice.    Host: Golden radio voice.    Dan Huot: Back out on the airwaves where it belongs.    Host: Yeah.     [ Laughter ]    >> Thank you.     [ Laughter ]    Host: Golden voice, everybody.  All right.  I'm going to open this.  It's probably going to make a lot of noise.  While we're doing that, I wanted to tell everyone that a lot of the episodes that we did throughout our 52 episodes were suggestions from you.    Alex Perryman: Yep.    Host: One of my favorites, actually, was spacesuits.  Someone suggested spacesuits, and I was like, \"Oh my gosh, of course we have to have a spacesuits episode.\"  So we brought on Les Padilla, hardware manager for the EMU, which is the suit they have up on the Space Station right now.  That's the one they actually go outside the Space Station and work outside in.  And we just had a chat about what spacesuits are all about.  So if you like the show, please give us suggestions on what you would like to listen to and we will actually pay attention to those.  The way I've been doing it is you have to type in Houston, We Have a Podcast to, like, Twitter or Facebook or something because that's what I do.  I just kind of, like, search that within the social media platform.  Like, \"Oh, that's a really good idea.\"  What was the other one we did?  BEAM.    Alex Perryman: BEAM, yeah.    Host: BEAM was another suggestion.  I was like, \"Oh yeah, we should totally do one on BEAM.\"  Because at the time the actual studies had sort of wrapped up.  And now it's there as, like, a storage unit on the Space Station.  So that one's pretty cool.  And then also, this one would actually be really helpful for us, too, is rate us.  Five stars would be preferred.  But, you know, whatever you think.  If you really enjoy the podcast, that actually helps us say to our managers, \"Hey, look, people really like this and we should continue to do it.\"  So please leave some stars and then any comments you have for us, both praise and anything critical.  Because we will pay attention to that and kind of fix it along the way.  Have we?  I think we've made a couple fixes.    Alex Perryman: Yeah, the room change was one of them.    Host: The room change was definitely one of them, yeah, and the mic.  And we actually have a -- we have a third mic right now, and we're hopefully going to get some more.  But yeah, if you want to see more, like, video episodes or if you want to do --    Dan Huot: Yeah, those would be fun.    Host: Longer, shorter, if you have a topic, you know, just leave them there.  And I'll end by saying thank you to Alex for sticking with me the whole time and dealing with all of my stuff.    Alex Perryman: Yay.    Dan Huot: Yay.    Host: All of my nagging, \"Hey, did you send the transcription yet?  Hey, when is this going to be edited?  Hey, can I get -- \" yeah, so anyway.    Alex Perryman: I just need to edit this.  It's 2.5 seconds right here and we should be good.  We should be good.    Host: And for Dan because I can't do this all by myself.  So thank you for coming on and hosting and being a part of it and helping to get it off the ground.    Dan Huot: I mean, I do the easy stuff.  So.     [ Laughter ]  No, I would thank you guys because you built this from scratch.  And now we're 52 episodes in.  And we have a cake.  So you did a really good.    Host: Awesome.    Alex Perryman: Thank you.    Host: Cool.  All right, I think we'll end there.  And oh yeah.  Well, okay, the final thank you is to you, the listener.  Thank you for tuning in.  Thank you for subscribing.  Thank you for listening to our show and keeping us going and giving us feedback so that we can continue to do this.    Alex Perryman: Yay.    Host: Yay.     [ Whistles ]     [ Laughter ]    Dan Huot: Cake.    Alex Perryman: You can press the red button now, Pat.     [ Music ]     Host: Hey, thanks for sticking around.  We had a lot of the fun recording this annual episode -- well, the one-year birthday episode of Houston, We Have a Podcast.  And I'm glad I got to sit with my team.  And really, thanks to Alex for sticking with me through the whole thing and dealing with all of my crap.  She's sitting right next to me [Laughs], constantly bugging her every single week.  \"Hey, is the transcript ready?  Hey, is the episode ready?\"  So it's been quite a ride.  And then Dan just helping out from start to finish, just making sure that it's successful all the way through.  So also one thing I forgot to mention during the episode was a huge thanks to NASA in Silicon Valley podcast for our friends over at Ames.  Whenever we were starting the podcast, I kind of didn't really understand fully how to do it the NASA way, and they already had their established.   So I was actually talking with Matt Buffington and Jerry Colon, some of those guys out there to understand just how do you do this?  And they were very helpful along the way.  So thanks, guys, if you're listening.  Really appreciate your help.  You can go listen to them.  That's NASA in Silicon Valley.  Otherwise you can listen to Gravity Assist.  That's our other NASA podcast out at headquarters.  And hopefully we'll have a couple more coming because I'm really digging the whole podcast scene here at NASA.  So otherwise you can go to NASA.gov/ISS to get the latest information on the International Space Station.  If you've noticed through all of our 52 episodes, a lot of them have been directly related to some of the research and the people, actually, that actually go and work on the International Space Station.  So you can learn a lot there.  We are still taking #AskNASA questions.  So use that hashtag and then just make sure to mention Houston, We Have a Podcast and we'll bring your questions or ideas right on the show.   We even said, you know, the spacesuit episode and the BEAM episode.  There's been a couple others, too, that were directly influenced -- space medicine, the one with Natasha Chough, astronaut health, that was another one.  Hey, I want to learn what a flight surgeon does.  We're like, \"Okay, let's bring her on.\"  So yeah, all of these were suggestions from you guys, the listeners that we brought right on the show.

                        "description": "Gary Jordan (Host):  Houston, we have a podcast.  Welcome to the official podcast of the NASA Johnson Space Center Episode 55, \"Living Off the Land.\"  I'm Gary Jordan and I'll be your host today.  So in this podcast, we bring in the experts, NASA scientists, engineers, astronauts, all the coolest people.  We bring them right here in the show and talk about all the coolest information that's going on right here at NASA.  So today, we're talking about in-situ resource utilization.  Here, we call it ISRU.  This is the ability to find and use natural resources beyond Earth.  I'm especially excited for this episode because ISRU is how we're going to terraform other planets and make them habitable for humans to live.  Planet colonization opens up a whole new world of space exploration.  How will we derive the resources we need from the bare landscape of the moon?  How will the first Martian colonies survive?  Such an unforgiving environment.  And most importantly, will they miss Netflix?  So today, we're talking to John Gruener and Steve Hoffman.  John Gruener has been at NASA since 1986.  He currently works in Astromaterials Research and Exploration Science.   This is the ARES division, A-R-E-S.  He works on advanced mission planning for the future human and robotic exploration of the moon and Mars.  In the past, he's worked for mineralogy laboratories developing a mineral-based substrate for the plant growth and regenerative life support systems.  He also supported the Mars Exploration Rover Missions of Spirit and Opportunity.  Gruener can be described as not only a rocket scientist but also a systems engineer, a space farmer and a planetary scientist.  Steve Hoffman received a bachelor's, master's and doctorate in Aeronautical and Astronautical Engineering from the University of Illinois and he has 35 years of experience in the space industry.  He's been involved with everything from program management to spacecraft design to orbital mechanics.  And he now supports the Exploration Mission Planning Office here at the Johnson Space Center.  And he supports a variety of missions for human exploration beyond low Earth orbit with a particular focus on Mars.  Obviously, both of these guys are the real deal.  So with no further delay, let's go light speed and jump right ahead to our talk with John Gruener and Dr. Steve Hoffman.   Enjoy.    [ Music ]   Let's do it, yes.  Seriously, let's go straight from there because that leads into -- that's the whole point.  ISRU spells out in-situ resource utilization, right?    John Gruener: That's right.    Host: It just means living off the land.  You got, you only have so much you can bring so what is there that you can utilize, that you can turn into something useful?  And it sounds like you already have a lot of ideas about ISRU, right?    John Gruener: Yes, for both the moon and Mars.    Host: Both the moon and Mars.    John Gruener: You know, Steve just mentioned the atmosphere on Mars.  Of course, the moon has no atmosphere.  And so what you're looking at are the rocks and soils are for the longest idea, the longest time, we thought, you know, that's what we're going to use on the moon, the rocks and the soil.  And just recently, within the last 10 or 15 years or so, we've had measurements of water ice in the polar regions of the moon, right.  So now, it's not just rocks and soils anymore.  Now, it's ice.  And of course, water is going to be the most critical thing out there in space for people.  A lot of people say it's going to be more valuable than gold.  Because, of course, we need water or we die fairly quickly.  You can split water into hydrogen and oxygen and we need that oxygen to breathe or we die very quickly.  And hydrogen and oxygen are great rocket propellants.  So water is going to be, you know, hugely important out there and there are science fiction TV shows on television right now and at the movie theaters that focus on this theme of resources and people battling over resources and all that.   So they're going to be critically important.  So we're really happy we found water on the moon because there's a way to make water on the moon out of the rocks and the dirt, right.    Host: Yeah.    John Gruener: The more --    Host: The rocks and the dirt that are everywhere or just in the polar regions?    John Gruener: All over the moon.    Host: Oh.    John Gruener: Right, yeah, so the Apollo astronauts brought back about 800 pounds of rocks and soil when I was a little kid.  And scientists measured those and you learn about all the chemical elements and the minerals, right.  So it's really the mineralogy that's important.  And most of the minerals on Mars or on the moon are silicate minerals, right.  And so, part of those silicate minerals is a lot of oxygen, all right, like 40, 45% by weight oxygen just sitting in those minerals.    Host: Wow.    John Gruener: The problem is you have to break the chemical bonds.  So those oxygen are bonded to silicones and are bonded to irons and magnesiums and calciums.  So you got to break these chemical bonds which require lots of energy, okay.  And so it's like, well, yeah.  We can make water on the moon out of the minerals.  The hydrogen comes from the solar wind.  So since the moon has no magnetic field like the Earth does, you know, in school, we all learned about this thing called the geomagnetic tails or the radiation from the sun hits our magnetic fields and then kind of goes around, kind of like a teardrop shape.  So they -- the magnetic field protects it from all that.  Well, on the moon, since there's no magnetic field, that solar wind is just hitting the surface of the moon all the time.  And a huge constituent of the solar wind is hydrogen, right.  And so you have hydrogen slamming into the moon and being retained by the soil and the minerals on the moon.  You have oxygen.  So now, you have all you need to make water, right.   And not only are we finding out that there is water ice in the polar regions but we're finding out there's not quite water but hydroxyl.  So that's kind of a water ion, O and H, but it could be water as well but mostly hydroxyl.  Just by the combination of that solar wind when hitting these minerals, finding oxygen and making these little bonds.  So there's small amounts of hydroxyl and possibly water all over the moon.  And of course, we didn't know any of this until we started putting robotic satellites in orbit starting in the mid-90s and then all the way up today.  We have lunar reconnaissance orbiter around the moon right now.    Host: Right.    John Gruener: And one of the instruments on there is the neutron spectrometer looking for that water ice.  We have a UV spectrometer looking for that water frost, you know, in some of these regions.  So water is critical and we have it at the moon now.  So that would probably be one of the very things people working in the in-situ resource utilization field, the ISRU field -- water production will probably be one of the first things people will try to do.  Because if you have water, you can now sell water, right?  And you don't really care what your customers use it for.  If they want to use it for rocket propellant, that's fine.  They want to use it for life support consumables, that's fine.  But just having that commodity of water and being able to sell it or use it is going to be really important.    Host: Well, first, you got to make it and then you can do the other stuff.    John Gruener: You have the other stuff --    Steve Hoffman: But see, that's a -- there's sort of a chicken-and-egg problem there, too.  If you're going to sell it, you have to have a customer for it but the customers aren't going to show up until they know that they have this stuff there.    Host: So you've got to have the capability first.    Steve Hoffman: Well, it's a chicken-and-egg problem.    Host: Yeah.    Steve Hoffman: So who now, it's somebody has got to start.  One, there's got to be either a customer there with a demand for it and then somebody will follow and fill the demand.  Or somebody's going to demonstrate that they can do this and have that commodity ready to go or at least have the technology ready to go.  So that the customers, the people who are going to generate demand will feel confident enough that they can, you know, invest whatever else they have to do to go there and use this stuff.  The way we usually get around that is some, usually a government or a research field of one sort or another breaks or takes the first leap.  Some organization that has enough resources that they can invest in something like this without having to answer to stockholders or other investors for a return on that investment.  And demonstrate that they can do this sort of stuff.  Now, so there's a big risk but there's a big payoff in that sort of thing.  And so whoever demonstrates this first and demonstrates not only can you do it which we kind of know we can do it, but has -- puts that chemical plant in place that actually takes all these dirt and other things and turns it into a bottle of water, that organization is going to get a big payoff.   Now, if it's a government -- governments usually are magnanimous about this and turn it over to somebody else to use.  But there could be other people or could be other investors, people with enough resources to do this on their own, that they may just go off and do it on their own.  And you know, they'll reap the reward in doing that.    Host: Now, is the reward specifically for space travel or are there Earth applications that may be part of this investment, I guess?    John Gruener: It's tough to make people who looked at that for a long time and it's tough to make a case, mainly because of the transportation cost.  You know, if you're talking about -- so take water as our example again.  You can go down to the grocery store and buy, you know, a case of water for five bucks.  If you had to pay for all the transportation cost to get water from the moon, back here, put it in bottles.  It'd be a lot more than five bucks for that case of water.  So that's what I mentioned before, sort of a rule of thumb for ISRU is to use this stuff as close to where you're producing it as possible.  So you minimize, if not eliminate, that transportation cost piece of the whole equation.    Host: So he's talking about, so when you're talking ISRU, you're talking about turning, getting water specifically from the moon.  It's not like you can take that same technology of creating water on the moon and bring it to Earth because the moon has -- is made of different things.    John Gruener: And we don't need to.    Host: And we don't need to.    John Gruener: We are a water world, right?    Host: Yeah but still extracting -- well, I mean, maybe not.  Maybe not water in this case.  You're right, because we're a water world.  But extracting resources from there.  They're living off a land component.    John Gruener: So there are other resources people do talk about bringing back to the Earth.  One of them is helium-3.  Helium is also a part of the solar wind so it constantly is embedded into the lunar surface.  And some day, you know, if we can ever develop fusion reactors versus our fission reactors that we have today, the people that work in that industry say that helium-3 is a great fuel for fusion reactors, right.  And so that's something that somebody like Apollo 17 astronaut Jack Schmidt, he likes to talk a lot about helium-3.  The Chinese National Space Agency right now and the Russians also talk about helium-3.  My time with helium-3 is when I was in college back in the '80s, we were -- they were, you know, digging a big hole at the University of Texas and they were going to put a Tokamak reactor and fusion energy wasn't going to be solved.  Well, here we are in 2018 and we're still not close to producing fusion or you know, making fusion reactors that really work.   So helium-3 is talked a lot about.  You'll see that in the press, you know, in bringing back that to Earth.  Some people talk about bringing a platinum group, metals back to the Earth primarily from asteroids and rare Earth metals that you use in the semiconductor business in batteries and things like that, you know.  Because those are hard to find and precious around the Earth.  So those are the kind of things people do talk about bringing back to the Earth.  Not so much water.    Host: So it's not necessarily the resource itself from -- I guess, is it fair to say that there's plenty of helium-3 to provide fuel?  It's just the technology isn't quite there yet to actually do something with it.    John Gruener: To do something with it, that's right.  So the helium-3 is sitting there on the moon, waiting for us.    Host: Yeah.    John Gruener: Waiting for the technologies to mature.  And I don't remember, Steve, maybe you know that somebody back in the, you know, when the Shuttle was flying, they talked about a Shuttle payload bay where the helium-3 would power the United States for, I don't know, how many days or months but it was, it was pretty incredible.    Host: Wow.    Host: So it's --    Steve Hoffman: Probably more than that.    John Gruener: Yeah, it's a pretty neat fuel source if we ever get that fusion reactor technology developed.    Steve Hoffman: It doesn't take much to generate a lot of power from nuclear sources like that.  So yeah, a Shuttle payload bay folder stuff would probably -- it's more like years or decades it could power.    John Gruener: So just to follow up on this water on the moon --    Host: Oh, yeah.    John Gruener: You know, the reason we like the pole so much is because water is already there in the form of ice, all right.  So we had a spacecraft called LCROSS.  It flew out to the moon with Lunar Reconnaissance over the back in 2009.  And LCROSS was a really fun little mission where people over at Ames Research Center, they had two spacecraft and they basically smashed one into a permanent shadowed, you know, permanently dark area of the moon where we're pretty sure there was water ice.  A plume of all sorts of volatiles escaped into space because of that high-energy crash.  Another spacecraft threw through the plume.  It measured what was in it.  And the most abundant compound was water, right.  So we have ground truth that there is water ice at the poles of the moon.  And the neat thing about that is we only have to heat the dirt up a few hundred degrees to volatilize or you know, get that water, melt it, vaporize it and collect it.   Earlier, we were talking about using the rocks and minerals and breaking chemical bonds.  That requires thousands of degrees of energy, huge amounts of kilowatts of power.  So the promise of the water ice at the moon is it's already there.  We can get to it with small amounts of energy versus the large amounts where you're breaking chemical bonds.  But the moon, the environment there in the polar regions very extreme.    Host: Yes.    John Gruener: I mean, in the -- so on the Earth, we have, you know, our axis of rotation is tilted and we have seasons.  And so, unfortunately, here in Texas, we're moving into summer because we're pointing at the sun.    Host: Oh, feeling it already.    John Gruener: Yeah, well so the moon's axis of rotation's almost perpendicular, straight up and down to the big ecliptic plane.  That plane where all the planets orbit the sun, right?  And so, you could imagine the moon at the equator, the energy from the sun, the sunlight is just coming straight overhead.  It's really intense.  But as you go up in the ladder to these are the North Pole or the South Pole, now the energy from the sun is more of a glancing blow.  And now you get to the very poles of the moon and now the energy of the sun is going parallel right across the surface.  I don't know if you remember your geometry class in high school?  But when the intersection of a curve and a line --    Host: Tangent?    John Gruener: The tangent, there you go.    Host: Oh, I remember.    John Gruener: That little bitty point, right?  So imagine you're sitting in a hole at the poles of the moon, a crater, if you will.  Well, that sunlight's going to cross parallel to the surface.  It's never going to get into your hole.    Host: Yeah.    John Gruener: And for about two-and-a-half billion years now, we think there are these craters in the polar regions have been permanently shadowed, very, very cold.  I mean, colder than Pluto cold, you know.  People are always thinking Pluto is the coldest thing in the solar system because it's way out there.  But Pluto's actually receiving sunlight and reflecting that sunlight.  And that's why we can see Pluto.  These craters never get sunlight so we're talking, you know, 25, 30 Kelvin.    Host: Oh.    John Gruener: That's just barely over absolute zero.    Host: Yeah.    John Gruener: All right.  So the challenge is from the engineering standpoint.  Great, we have water ice in these permanently dark, very, very cold places.  Now, build me a robot that can work in that environment, you know.    Host: So this is probably freezes that [inaudible].    John Gruener: Yeah, yeah.    Steve Hoffman: But these metals will just crystallize and you, they'll just shatter like a piece of glass.    Host: Wow.    Steve Hoffman: I mean, so those cold temperatures are part of the biggest deterrent from doing what can be as simple as heating up the soil and just collecting the vapor that comes off it.  So the technology of gathering that water is very simple but the materials that you need to survive in that environment are something that they're very challenging from what we can get out of it.    John Gruener: Yeah, folks out of the Jet Propulsion Lab are working on something called bulk metallic glass instead of metal so you can build gears and structural components out of this stuff and it can better withstand these really, really cold temperatures.  So scientifically, we know the stuff's there.  And we kind of have an idea of where to go.  Now, we don't really know how deep it goes into the subsurface.  All of our remote sensing instruments can only get down, you know, less than a meter.  The LCROSS impact probably went down only three to five meters.  So understanding the subsurface amount so in the mining world, they call it grade and tonnage, you know.  How pure is it and how much of it is there?    Host: Right.    John Gruener: Because a lot of it is going to have to be there to be economically feasible or if we're really going to use it for rocket propellants.  You know, if you have one cup of water out in the middle of the desert, that's not going to last you that long.  But if you have a whole oases out in the desert, that'll last you quite a while.    Host: Yeah, because if you're talking about a surface mission, let's say, you're bringing humans down to the surface, maybe near the poles.  I don't know if that would be feasible or if it would be too cold there.  But not necessarily in the crater where it's 30 Kelvin but if you're near the source of where you can produce the water, is there enough to get something out of it, to create enough oxygen, to create enough water and to create the propellant that we need?    John Gruener: That's what we have to find out and so, in the economic, you know, the mineral world of mining companies, you know, that phase is called prospecting.  And so, we have a lot of data sets from orbit from our remote sensing but we have to get robots down to the surface to do ground prospecting so we can get a better idea of the grade and tonnage of this stuff to see if it really even makes sense to pursue it.  But so you know, you talked about people landing.  I mentioned, you know, these holes, these craters at the polar regions that are permanently dark, permanently cold.  Well, so think just the opposite, so now I'm at that tangent point between the line of the circle and I'm not in the hole anymore.  But now, I'm on a mountain peak.  And what are you going to see?  You're going to see the sun just about all of the time, okay.  So there are a handful of locations both at the North and the South Pole that sees the sunlight almost 90% of the time.  So most places on the moon like all the places we visited with Apollo, you wind up with two weeks' worth of daylight followed by two weeks' worth of darkness, right.   And that's your typical lunar day on the moon, if you like.  And that's all because of the orbit of the moon around the Earth.  But again, when you get to the poles and you have that perpendicular axis of rotation, that whole two weeks of darkness and two weeks of sunlight goes right out the window and now it's all based on topography.  So on the high points, you'll get a lot of sunlight.  The low points, you'll get a lot of darkness.  So the idea is for people to land and work and live in the high points where there's sunlight.  And now, we can use solar rays, just you know, like on the space station, we have these really tall rectangular solar rays.  You put something like that on the surface of the moon at the poles and you know, you jack it up into the sky.  Now you can receive sunlight 100% of the time.    Host: Yeah.    John Gruener: So the people are living in the sunlight, getting energy from the sun with solar rays.  So that's very low tech.  You know, we don't need nuclear reactors for that.  And then you're sending your robots into the dark to harvest the water ice.  That's kind of the grand picture someday.  But first, we have to do the prospecting to find the stuff in useful quantities.  We got to do the technology development.    Host: Right.    John Gruener: To see if your machines can even operate in those very cold temperatures.  And then we have to have the human systems as well.    Host: So where are we now?  You hinted at the beginning that we have been looking at ISRUs since the '80s.  But how about technology?  Have we sent anything into space?  Have we tested stuff from the ground?    John Gruener: Just we have one experiment.  I'll let Steve talk about this, getting ready to go to Mars on Mars 2020 called Moxie, right.  And it's all about making oxygen out of the atmosphere at Mars.  So you tell it.    Steve Hoffman: [Inaudible] well, to back up one step though.  The technologies that we're talking about using for many of these concepts, whether it's heating up or breaking up chemical bonds or just heating up the ground and capturing the water, a lot of that stuff is technology that's been used on Earth for, you know, decades, centuries --    John Gruener: Centuries.    Steve Hoffman: In some cases.    Host: Oh wow.    Steve Hoffman: So the --    John Gruener: But in space, nothing.  So we haven't done any of these demonstrations in space yet.  Moxie will be our first.    Steve Hoffman: So on Earth, we can afford to have giant chemical plants and when something breaks, it's very easy to go fix it.  When you send something into space, right now we don't, it's usually a robotic device without any people around.  And so if it breaks, you're done.  So we have to -- we have to -- and launching stuff off the surface of the Earth and getting it to some other destination requires a rocket of some size, usually quite large compared to the payload.  So when you talk about taking those technologies that have been used on Earth for centuries in some cases, and sending it somewhere else, now we're talking about the engineering to make that thing very small, very light and very reliable so that you can operate it for very long periods of time without -- with the expectation that it's not going to break.    John Gruener: And when I talk to school kids and I say, you know, we have hundreds of thousands of equations at NASA.  And fortunately, I've forgotten most of them.  Because I'm 57, I'm, you know, I'm going to be in this another five, six, 10 years maybe.  But the most simplest equation and the most simplest concept to remember is mass equals money, right.  If you want to send a lot of mass into space, you better have to have a lot of money, because you need this big rocket that Steve was talking about, right.  We never have a lot of money so we try to minimize our mass as much as possible.  So you're not going to see big front-end loaders like you know, you go to a construction site here on the Earth and you see these huge vehicles.  Big massive vehicles with big rippers and front-end loaders and drag lines.  We can't do that on the planets because we don't, we can't get all that mass to the planets in the first place.    Host: Right.    John Gruener: Way too expensive.  So our robots are going to be smaller, nimble, more agile, right.  And you're just going to have to accept a slower pace of accumulating the resources than we do here on Earth where we have these big monster vehicles that can, you know, dig up a whole baseball field in one big scoop.  We're just -- we don't have the -- you know, where the tyranny of the rocket equation.  We just don't have the money to afford a huge rocket to send big tractors and bulldozers to the planets.    Host: How nice it would be though to have a moon bulldozer.  That would be pretty nice.    John Gruener: That would be cool.    Steve Hoffman: All right, so he mentioned something called Moxie.    Host: Right, yeah.    Steve Hoffman: What are things on Mars that we have -- that's on Mars that we don't have on the moon is an atmosphere.  And that atmosphere is very thin compared to here on Earth.  It's -- to find a similar pressure and density here on Earth, you'd have to go out to an altitude of about 100,000 feet.  So it's very, very thin.  But it's there.  So that makes it something that we can use.  It's mostly carbon dioxide, about 95% carbon dioxide.  Most of the rest is nitrogen and then there's traces of other stuff.  So when we talked about using water for rocket propellant, we're also looking using that atmosphere to make at least part of rocket propellant for a human mission.  We can all see but you could also use that for robotic missions.  We'd like to do a sample return from Mars, for example.  So the rockets don't care if the payload on board is a rock or a human being.   It's just its mass that the rocket is moving around.    Host: Right.    Steve Hoffman: They both use rocket propellant.  Moxie is a way to get oxygen out of that carbon dioxide and with the idea that that would be half of the two kinds of rocket propellant that you need to get something off the surface.    John Gruener: And so for rocket propellants, you have a fuel and you have an oxidizer.  So here on the Earth, you know, we talked about earlier that Earth's a water world.  Well, here on Earth, we have oxygen in our atmosphere.  So the good old, you know, internal combustion engines in our cars and in our lawn mowers and everything else uses the oxygen in the atmosphere as an oxidizer to get that fuel oxidizer combination going.  And you get, you know, energy out of that.  But we don't have --    Host: But you can pull it straight from the atmosphere.    John Gruener: That's right.    Host: Yeah.    John Gruener: That's right.  So we, you know, we don't need oxidizers here on the surface of the Earth.    Host: Right.    John Gruener: But we do out there on the planets and Steve, what's that gear ratio usually between oxidizer and propellant?  Like seven-to-one or six-to-one usually?    Steve Hoffman: It depends upon which combination you're using.  But it's mostly in the -- for the combinations that we want to use on Mars is mostly oxygen.  So it's to our benefit to be able to make oxygen there.    John Gruener: And even if you can't make the fuel there, you make the oxygen, you just satisfy the bulk of your propellant needs.    Steve Hoffman: And in this case, it's on, it's in the 70% to 80% range of the total mass that you need for a rocket to get off the ground.  So I can bring the 20% of fuel and in our case, what we're looking at now is methane.  But we'll make the oxygen while we're there.  We know where the atmosphere is.  It's everywhere.  So it doesn't restrict us to where we can land.  John was talking about these ice fields being at the poles.  So that constrains us to land at one of the pole on the moon if we want to use [inaudible] -- excuse me, if we want to use water.  On Mars, at least for the oxygen part, we can land wherever we want to.  And we can use a device similar to Moxie to pull that oxygen or pull the atmosphere into the device.  You separate out all the dust and the nitrogen and the other stuff that you don't want.  And you take that carbon dioxide and then you use processes that we understand well from doing the same thing on Earth.   Separate it into carbon monoxide and oxygen and keep the oxygen part.  And you'll let the other rest of it go.  So Moxie is the first.  We know how that technology works.  We haven't demonstrated that we know how to do it from a practical point of view in an environment like Mars.  So Moxie is being flown on Rover that's going to be launched in 2020.  It's job will be to do that actual demonstration that says, \"Okay, in this real environment with real dust and impurities and other things and temperatures, all that sort of stuff that goes into actually making this thing work for real will be there and we'll run Moxie to demonstrate that we can at least do that part of collecting the atmosphere, filtering out the stuff we don't want and then getting the oxygen out the back end that we can use.    Host: Is there a storing component?  You would grab the oxygen and then kind of put it into a tank?    Steve Hoffman: Eventually.    Host: Okay.    Steve Hoffman: I don't -- I think Moxie and now I'm trying to remember where Moxie -- I do not think will store that but eventually, we'll have to store it somewhere.    Host: Yeah.    John Gruener: So at the very beginning, you know, we mentioned the prospecting part of finding resources.  The other part, the technology part is demonstrations.    Host: Yes.    John Gruener: So for the next decade, you know, that's kind of where we are in the world of resource utilization and understanding what resources are available on the moon or Mars.  It's all about prospecting and demonstrations and mostly robots.  You know, we won't have people on the moon for quite a while.  We won't have people on Mars even longer.  So it's going to be a lot of robotic technology demonstrations at sites where certain resources are where you know you can turn those resources into certain products.  You know, it's all about getting to the useful product eventually.    Steve Hoffman: But there -- so there's another example though of things that are going on, on Earth that will eventually adapt in some form for these other planets.  A lot of the mines, the big mines that you see on Earth are becoming more and more automated.  The trucks are driving around on their own.  There's no driver on board.  Some of the machinery that's digging things out of the ground are just supervisors.  Nobody in there pulling levers or steering the machine anymore.  It's somebody watching on the screen to make sure that it's digging in the right spot and hasn't gone off somewhere else where it's not supposed to be.  We can take that same kind of technology that we're learning how to do and working all the bugs out here on Earth, and then miniaturize it and improve its reliability.  And then we can send it off to the moon or Mars and have those robots do a lot of the work that used to take people here on Earth to do in a more intensive fashion.   Intensive in the sense that they had to have a lot more people to make this thing work.  Now I don't have to have a lot of people anymore.  And in fact, I've got the people here sitting on the Earth and instead of watching a mine that might be in Arizona somewhere which they can do, now I'm sitting on Earth and I'm watching a mine that's on the surface of the moon.  Or I'm sitting on Earth and I'm watching a mine that's working on the surface of Mars.  And until there's something that the robots themselves can't handle and we have to send people to correct that situation where there is something broke or something unexpected happened, we can sit here on Earth and we can have our minds working on these other planets, making these commodities that -- that will then be available when people actually do go there for whatever reason they're going there for.    Host: Right, so robotically, we would sort of develop the infrastructure to eventually support a human mission.  Assuming that if we do send humans to, let's just say, Mars in this example.  If we send humans to Mars to live, we can expect that the mining operations will have been tested, demonstrated and you have these tanks of oxygen and water and rocket propellant and everything.    Steve Hoffman: Well, we'd like to hope so.  But just like Moxie, the Mars environment is not the Earth environment.  So we'll have to do, as John said, we'll have to do demonstrations to convince ourselves that we know what we're talking about or we know we can do what we say we can do.  Then it's a question -- we're back to that chicken-and-egg kind of question.  When do you, when do I start building a mine because that's going to require a lot of investment to be able to do that, if there's nobody there?  I mean, if there's no -- if there's no demand on the moon or on Mars for this whatever you're making in this mine, why are you building the mine?    Host: Yeah.    John Gruener: So there has, they're going to probably evolve or expand or get in place more or less together.  I mean, they'll probably be a little mine, a little group of people that get, turns into a bigger mine and a bigger group of people.  And they'll just kind of grow together as demand grows and the suppliers will have to grow with them and vice-versa.    Host: John, I wanted to ask you about the simulants that you're working on because --    John Gruener: You're right, I was just going to jump in here because --    Host: There you go.    John Gruener: -- we're talking about all these technology demonstrations in space.  And of course, when you're building hardware, you want to understand what's going to happen when it gets all dusty.  Are the hinges going to work?    Host: Right.    John Gruener: Or are the shock absorbers, things that move in and out, are they going to work?  And you know, though we brought back about 840 pounds of rocks and soil from the moon, we've never brought anything back from Mars.  Now, Mother Nature always done that for us through meteorites, right, so we have an idea of maybe what some of that stuff's like on Mars.  We also have our robots on Mars making those measurements.  But we don't just have planetary materials to give out to the technology world to help them with their machines in developing their robots.  So what we do in the planetary science world here in the Astromaterials Division at JSC, we look at what we found on the moon and Mars.  And we look at the chemistry and the mineralogy.  And then we look around the Earth, mainly the United States because that's where we are and we find rocks and minerals and soils that are similar in composition, similar in mineralogy and then we'll go and collect those in the fields.   We'll grind them up into you know, very, very tiny particles so that they mimic the particle size that are on the moon or Mars.  And now, we have a bucket of fake moon dirt or fake Mars dirt that we can give to our technologist to test their systems and to see how it's really going to work.  So you know, the challenge of that is you can't just go to the store and buy one bucket of moon simulant because the moon's a very diverse planetary body, just like Mars is.  And so, there are numerous different simulants you could design and you know, recipes, if you will, for certain processes.  You know, so like right now, we're working on a Mars simulant that simulates a very specific windblown deposit on Mars called Rocknest.  You know, our Curiosity Rover's on Mars.  It measured this dune-like looking thing that was called Rocknest.  They put it in an oven.  They cooked it and they wound up with about one to three weight percent water.    Host: All right.    John Gruener: So they said, \"Oh, cool.  There's water right there in the sand dunes of Mars, you know.\"  Now, of course, there's also water ice all over Mars.  So you know, water's going to be a lot easier on Mars than the moon.  That's for sure.    Host: Nice.    John Gruener: But the ISRU guys, the technologists wanted to design something where they could easily dig into a sand dune, cook it and boil the water out.  So we, you know, just recently were working on a simulant that will produce one to three weight percent water out of the same chemistry and mineralogy of Rocknest on Mars, right.  So that's a very specific simulant.  You look back at the moon in the night sky.  You see the dark areas.  You see those bright areas.  All those dark areas are just basaltic lava flows.  I mean, the same stuff that on the news right now coming out of the ground in Hawaii?    Host: Right.    John Gruener: Yeah, same stuff as that's those dark areas on the moon, all right.  And so, a lot of iron.  A lot of magnesium on the moon, something called titanium and a mineral called ilmenite.  So you know, everybody knows about titanium.  You know, that stuff's strong.  You see it advertised on TV.  Well, if you want to do a process to mine the dark areas of the moon or the Maria regions so its lava flows.  Now you're going to need a different simulant than you would, say, for the polar regions where now you're talking about the bright areas of the moon.  So you know, you look at the bright areas of the moon and that's not lava at all.  That's a feldspathic mineral called anorthosite.  So a lot of calcium and aluminum whereas the basalts were mostly, you know, iron and magnesium and things like that.  So the simulant business is kind of tricky because sometimes, NASA is really interested in the moon for a while.  And so we'll think about moon simulants.  And then sometimes, NASA is interested in Mars for a while and so we had to come up with Mars simulants, right.   And there's not just one simulant for the moon and one simulant for Mars.  There's all sorts of simulants for all sorts of processes.  So that's one of the things we do at the Astromaterials, you know.  We have the Mars scientists that are actually doing the experiments right now on Curiosity right in our building.  And so I work with them to find out, well, what is the chemistry and what is the mineralogy?  How can we find stuff like that here in the United States and make it available to our technologists?  So it's a pretty fun project.  It's a great mix of science and engineering.    Host: Yeah and you would think, you know, looking at the moon.  I mean, if you didn't know the intricate details of the moon like the mountains and the different regions, you would just think, \"Oh, any kind of -- any kind of technology you produced to grab water out of the moon is going to work universally around.\"  But it doesn't seem like that at all.  It seems like wherever you put it, you're going to need a different piece of technology because you're dealing with a different dirt, I guess.    John Gruener: That's right, yeah.  Different geologic deposits.    Host: Yeah.  So besides -- so going to the moon for just a second, talking about all of these different areas, we talk about water being one of the main things you would want to pull from the dirt.  You pulled the oxygen from the dirt and then the hydrogen, like you said, from the solar winds.  So you're getting a little bit of that.  What else could you pull from the dirt of the moon to make useful for something else?    John Gruener: So for a lot of years, people have talked about using those silicate minerals, you know, so like I said, most of the moon is silicate minerals, using the silica and those silicate minerals to make solar rays.    Host: Oh.    John Gruener: So you process the moon soil.  You make your solar rays and now, you're generating electricity with these solar rays that you made out of lunar materials, right.  So the silica could be used for that.  The iron that we were just talking about in the lava flows, of course, is the structural thing.  The titanium in those lava flows is a structural thing.  And the bright areas of the moon, the highlands, you have a lot of aluminum so again, there's a big structural thing.  There's something I'm just learning about as we're trying to find sources of simulant materials to represent the highlands of the moon.  There's something in the world called E-glass.  Steve, I don't know if you're familiar with E-glass.  But it's a structural thing.  So you know, we think of skyscrapers being made out of steel girders or we see aluminum panels on the side of barns and such.  E-glass made out of the highland materials of the moon may be a structural component someday.  So structural things like that, volatile things like the water and the oxygen.   And one thing we haven't talked about and one thing I spent a lot of my life in the 1990s doing was growing plants in simulants of planetary soil.  Because if we're ever going to have people there, we got to feed them, right?    Host: Oh, yes.    Steve Hoffman: That's the beauty of robots.  You don't have to feed them.  You don't have to water them.  You don't have to bring them home to their families.  But we do all of those things where there are the astronauts, right?    Host: Right.    Steve Hoffman: And so --    Steve Hoffman: But one of the things that the moon is deficient at is carbon.  And carbon is going to become an important constituent if we're going to go down that path.  So I mean, that -- there's an example of something where we're going to have to import a critically needed material to be able to pull off some of these kind of debt -- the crop growth, the animal growth, the feeding the human beings that are there kind of situation.    Host: At least, for a moon mission though.  On the Mars, I think you'll have more carbon.    Steve Hoffman: On Mars, we'll probably have all the constituents we need.  Although John can -- John the moon farmer and Mars farmer can tell you that that we can't just -- you can't just take a shovelful of dirt and put it in a bucket and grow things like was done on the [Inaudible].  You do have to remediate that soil.  You do have to take out some other things.    John Gruener: Take out the bad stuff.    Steve Hoffman: The bad stuff before you put your plants in it.  The best stuff that could either harm the plants or harm you, if you eat it because the plants take it up and then you consume it.  So ISRU is not a universal catchall.  There isn't everything everywhere that we need it.  There are still some things that we are going to have to bring with us to make supporting human beings for long periods of time and so plants make that possible.    John Gruener: Yeah, so in the geology world and in the Astromaterials Division where I work, when we were growing the plants, we were trying to come up with a substrate that would incorporate either the soil on the moon or Mars.  And so we had to work with the plant people, right.  So find plants that can grow in the types of soils and maybe do better with some nutrients.  So I had to learn all about biology, you know.  So my first degree was Aerospace Engineering because I thought, \"Oh, well I want to work in NASA.  Well, I better be an aerospace engineer.\"  That sounds very NASA, right?    Host: Right.    John Gruener: But after about six years or so and working with Steve way back in the late '80s and early '90s, part of my job was to go talk to the scientists and find out what they want to do on the moon so we can provide those systems for them, right?  And as I started talking more and more to the planetary scientists, I thought, \"Wow this is really cool stuff.\"    Host: Oh, yeah.    John Gruener: And so I went to night school to get my Planetary Science degree.  But it was all geology and so now I had to learn biology all of a sudden because now I'm working with the plant people and growing stuff in the soil on the moon or Mars.  And so, then I had to learn about, you know, so I learned chemistry.  We all learned chemistry, right?  But the 17 plant essential nutrients, do you happen to know what those are?    Host: Oh no.  I couldn't list them for you.    John Gruener: It turns out plants only need like 17 different chemical elements and they'll do pretty well, right.    Host: All right.    John Gruener: And we had those broken down between macronutrients and micronutrients.  And Steve mentioned carbon so that's one of the macronutrients.  So hydrogen, oxygen, carbon.  You know, those things we don't worry about in our fertilizers here in our soil because it's in the air and the water, right?  Hydrogen and oxygen, that's our water.  And then we all learned about photosynthesis and how plants take in CO2, right?  So as long as you have CO2 on Mars or you have astronauts on the moon exhaling CO2, we're going to get the carbon we need from the astronauts, right, through that CO2.    Host: Nice.    John Gruener: So just by the fact of having people on the moon or Mars, we're going to get our hydrogen, oxygen and carbon through the air and the water.  Now, the other things is where the soils come in, right.  So if you ever looked at a bag of fertilizer, there's three big numbers like 15-5-10 or 13-13-13.  Those are nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium, right.  We know those things are on Mars.  There's the problem with the nitrogen on the moon.  But again, we have those astronauts there.  And when we go to the bathroom, there's lots of nitrogen in what we put out of our bodies, right?    Host: All right.    John Gruener: Our water systems in our regenerative life support world will take some of that dirty water, what we would, you know, consider dirty water.  We couldn't drink the stuff because it's full of ammonium.  Well, ammonium, NH4 -- great, there's nitrogen.  So again, if astronauts are there and they're doing their usual human things, they're going to supply us nitrogen through the waste products, right?  And so now, we have the nitrogen from the humans.  The phosphorus, potassium -- they're on the planets.  The other macronutrients, calcium, magnesium, sulfur are on the planets.  And then you get into the micronutrients, the irons, the zincs, the coppers, the molybdenums, the borons.  All those things we have measured both on the moon and Mars.  So are all those chemical elements, those plant essential nutrients that we need, are on the moon.  They're on Mars.  But not everywhere.  So you want to go to your best places.  So on Mars, I don't know if you've ever seen pictures from Curiosity or some of those but there's these very dark-looking sand dune looking things, right.   And those are basically basaltic sands that have weathered out of basaltic rocks.  And the reason they're dark is they have not had many of their chemical elements leached out of them.  So we have that problem on Mars going for us, that we have acidic leaching of some of the chemical elements, right.  But those dark basaltic sands, what a great substrate for growing plants, you know.  The moon, we can get by.  We have what we need on the moon.  But probably not as good as Mars.  So you know, this whole idea of simulants and using the soils for plants, for our resource utilization, it's really, really a big picture, you know, [inaudible] in your mind.  Sometimes, it makes your head explode.  And there are so many different disciplines and you know, and technologies working in this area both on the science side and on the engineering side.    Host: Yeah, because I think one of the more interesting parts of when you're starting to describe these things is it's not as universal as you would probably assume.  If you're talking about Mars dirt, Mars is a planet.  Planets are big.  So there's different things happening in different areas.  Maybe in the polar regions of the moon, you have more water.  In the darker regions, there's a different makeup than maybe in some of the lighter regions.  So it's a more diverse way of approaching when you're thinking about another planet and it's interesting because you're going to have to have the technology to have things work whenever you get there.    John Gruener: I'm sure.  I mean, very much like here on Earth.  My wife's from Wisconsin.  Her family's a dairy farming family.  They have beautiful soil up there.  You live here in the Houston area where we got this heavy gumbo clay.  And if you're a home gardener, you got to fight this gumbo all the time.    Host: Oh, yeah.    John Gruener: So it's this really where you are on the planet, that's where, you know, drive the benefits from the local resources.    Steve Hoffman: And that's one of the benefits of these robots that we've been talking about was Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter or Curiosity or other robots that are on Mars.  They're doing part of this prospecting job for us right now.  They're doing the very basics of telling us what it is.  If we just saw this dark sand dune in the picture, we wouldn't know if that was basalt or if it was something else.  Now we know what it is and we know, we can kind of break down the chemicals that are in it.  And these robots are also telling us that over here, you got a real high concentration of what looks like a high -- we'll pick one of these chemicals.  You're going to find a concentration of it somewhere on one part of the planet but not in the other parts.  And these robots are helping us make those maps to tell us that it's -- there's a real valuable resource over here.  But if you go over somewhere else, not so much anymore.  So you want to, you can kind of pick your -- you can start to look at those maps and decide where it's more beneficial for you to try and set up one of these bases than not.    John Gruener: Just like the realtors tell you here on Earth.  Location, location, location [laughter].    Host: So I kind of wanted to bounce off of that to sort of wrap up this talk is at the theme here is robots are pretty easy.  You don't really have to worry about that but we're going to have to think about a lot of different ways to support human exploration of the moon and Mars.  And ISRU is just one component of the many things.    John Gruener: It's a huge component.    Host: One huge component of making this work.  And so, I kind of wanted to end with why -- why explore?  Why do we send humans to do this?  And why are we putting the effort into ISRU in the first place to make it a possibility and to put human boots on the moon and Mars?    John Gruener: Well, you know, we get that question a lot.  And Steve's jumping at the microphone so I'm going to let him go first.    Steve Hoffman: I was hoping you would [laughter].  Well, the -- the robots that we're sending to these other planets are extensions of ourselves.  People have this internal need or drive to understand what's going on around them, what's over the next hill, what can -- can I go and live there?  You know, a lot of us are in the United States because you go far enough back in our ancestry that somebody came from a different part of this world and settled here.  They didn't have to.  They could have remained exactly where they were.  But they moved.  That same kind of drive is going on now.  And eventually, that will extend to other planets.  So the difference, a big difference between that example of coming from another part of the Earth to the United States is that these other planets are not like the United States or any place else on Earth for that matter.   You can't just grow there and chop down a few trees or go there, chop a few trees, plant a garden and expect to live there.  You have -- there's going to be more work, considerably more work involved in being able to stay there for the rest of your life, if that's what you choose to do.  So we're making progress along those lines.  ISRU is going to be a big part of that.  You know, there's a permanent presence at the South Pole.  But no one's growing -- there aren't acres and acres of cornfields or cattle grazing or --    John Gruener: He's talking about McMurdo Station at our South Pole [laughter].    Steve Hoffman: Our South Pole, I'm sorry.  Actually, I'm talking about the geographic South Pole.  There's a huge station there with a permanent presence but everything has to be brought there.  Literally, everything has to be brought there.  So that's not some place where you're going to see a real estate agent setting up shop to sell you, you know, the four-bedroom family house or something along those lines.    John Gruener: Well, there is that UN Treaty that kind of gets in the way of the real estate agent.    Steve Hoffman: Okay, but my point is that humans know how to live and work in a lot of different places, a lot of hostile environments.  So if we're going to be there permanently, we're making progress along those lines.  Robots are helping us do that now.  There's going to be -- to get back to your original question, I think there's going to be no end of the desire or the drive by somebody or somebodies on Earth to go live on these other planets and live there permanently.  We've had no end of volunteers that says, \"You know, send me.  I'll go on a one-way trip.\"  So that drive is going to be there and what we're doing now is working on understanding what that environment's like so we can tell people what technologies they're going to need to be able to live and work and to enjoy themselves when they get there.  And you know, eventually spend the rest of their lives there.    John Gruener: And so, you know, why we explore it?  That's a very hard question to answer.  And a lot of times, it's the kindergarteners that ask that kind of question because it's a huge question and it sounds so simple.  And I don't have a real simple answer to that, right.    Host: Right.    John Gruener: But there is no simple answer to that so the past two days, I was at NASA's Glenn Research Center working on a little project.  That's why we had to delay this little talk.  And flying home, there was this woman with her little 18-month-old girl, right.  And I was sitting next to the window but boy, that little girl wanted to look out the window.  She just [inaudible], you know.  She couldn't say any words but you could just look at her eyes and look at her face and she was amazed at what she was seeing.  And that's just this innate quality in humans, right.  We're curious about stuff.  We want to know about things.  We want to see new things.  We want to experience new things.  And that's what, you know, a part of what exploration is about, learning new things, experiencing new things.    Host: Okay.    John Gruener: But then that practical side that we were talking a little bit, you know, earlier about maybe, you know, platinum metals in space or helium-3 or whatever resources out there that we might be able to use here on the Earth.  You know, that drive to try to make life better here on Earth, to supplement what we have here on Earth, so you know, we can keep going is critical, I think, to our species because you know, this is a great planet we're living on but sooner or later, we will run of our resources.  You know, as population gets bigger and bigger.  So what are those resources out in space and how can they help us live?  And maybe you do have to go live on the moon to utilize those resources or to Mars or you know, like on the TV shows, out at the asteroid belt.  Who knows?  But you know, that's hundreds of years from now but we have to start somewhere.  And that's kind of where we are right now.  We're kind of have to start in all of that, you know.   It probably would have been fun to go back in your way-back machine and land in the 13 colonies of the United States and you're at the start of a country.  And way back then, they had no idea what we would eventually evolve to, right?  And so, when it comes to space and space resources and people getting out there and living and working for long periods of time, we're at the very beginning.  And it's really hard to say where it's all going to go but we know resource utilization is going to be a big part of it.    Host: Exactly.  You don't, you can't really predict the future but you know that something good's going to come out of it.  And so you just sort of truck on.  And that's why you cross the Atlantic and start colonizing and then you realize that, oh, maybe the, you know, there's more to this than just the coast.  And so you expand west.  You know, there's this -- you just do it and eventually good things kind of come from it.  Kind of bouncing off your first point, I think one of the biggest things you said was experience.  And that I think though, you know, we can send robots.  Robots give us a lot of data about what we sent them there to do but in terms of experience, that's a very human thing.  And I think that's something that is really important whenever you're actually going out and to other planets and to the moon.  You know, like we sent stuff to the moon before humans landed there but it was not until humans landed there that really people latched on and were inspired.  I mean, I know a lot of people here were inspired to work here specifically because of in terms of that.    John Gruener: That's why Steve and I are here.    Host: Yeah, yeah.  It's that --    John Gruener: I'm guessing you weren't even born during Apollo [laughter].    Host: No, that was a little -- that was a little bit long, a little bit ago.  But yeah, so it just -- it still inspires me though.  I mean, I wasn't alive but it's something that really drove me to work here and to put my life's work into it.    John Gruener: Yeah, one of the things we just, you know, throw around cliches always.  But you know, you've never seen a ticker tape parade for a robot, right?  The Apollo astronauts got huge ticker tape parades.  They just had a big royal wedding over in England and of course, that was a huge parade, right?    Host: Yeah.    John Gruener: You don't see that for robots.    Host: Right.    John Gruener: But they're great tools for us but they're not humans.    Host: Exactly.  Well, John and Steve, thank you so much for coming on and talking a little bit about in-situ resource utilization for us today.    John Gruener: Sure, my pleasure.    Steve Hoffman: You're welcome.     [ Music ]    Host: Hey, thanks for sticking around.  So today, we talked with John Gruener and Steve Hoffman about in-situ resource utilization.

                        "description": "Gary Jordan (Host):  Houston, we have a podcast.  Welcome to the official podcast of the NASA Johnson Space Center, episode 56, Dr. Spaceman.  I'm Gary Jordan, and I'll be your host today.  So, we bring in the experts here.  NASA astronauts, NASA doctors, and sometimes astronaut doctors.  And that's what we're bringing on today.  An astronaut, and a medical doctor.  I need to go back to school.  Okay, so today we're talking with Dr. Mike Barratt, who started his career at NASA as a physician and a flight surgeon.  He flew to the International Space Station twice.  Once on a long duration in 2009, and again in 2011 on Space Shuttle Discovery.  He also served as the manager of the human research program that looks at the most prominent health and performance risks associated with human space flight.  And to figure out what to do about it and make astronauts safe and healthy as possible.  So, today, I talked with Dr. Barratt about the five hazards of human spaceflight.  We work with the human research program to identify these hazards.  We're looking at radiation, isolation and confinement, distance from Earth, altering gravity, and hostile and closed environments.   To give a broad overview of each of them from a medical doctor/astronaut, who has actually flown in space.  So, with no further delay, let's go lightspeed and jump right ahead to our talk with Dr. Barratt.  Enjoy.     [ Music ]    Host: Mike, thank you so much for coming on the podcast today to talk about your story and then, also these hazards.    Mike Barratt: My pleasure.    Host: All right.  So, I kind of want to start with just growing up.  I know you grew up in Washington state.    Mike Barratt: Yeah, so I grew up in kind of a farming community in southwestern Washington.  It was impossibly beautiful; mountains, forests.  Not that far from the ocean, and on the Columbia River.  And it was just a really good upbringing for so many reasons.  But, growing up on the farm, everything broke, and you had to fix it.  And you were always doing chores and getting up early in the morning.  And part of life that I really didn't appreciate until I left it and found others couldn't swing a hammer or turn a screwdriver and realized what an upbringing that was.  But fortunately for a small school, we had some very inspiring teachers.  Those that were very science and socially minded.  And these guys were just incredibly formative in my choice of careers and I guess my lifelong really love of learning.    Host: It was definitely the schooling, then, that really introduced you to the passion in kind of STEM field, then.    Mike Barratt: Yeah, I think so.  It was an interesting time because there were possibilities to do things with your hands that our teachers kind of inspired us to do.  So, I was building telescopes and I was building little habitats for mice to live underwater in the lake that was next to us, which was probably a bad idea for a lot of reasons.  And also, lofting them up in kites.  And so, I think that inspiration just causes you to do things that can do.  And a lot of us did that.  It was just, you know again very formative.    Host: So, how much of that was you playing with sort of equipment and doing kind of these, were you tearing things apart and bringing them back together and that kind of, like that classic kind of engineering thing to do?    Mike Barratt: Yeah, it wasn't so much that I was tearing things apart to see how they worked, it was really trying to build new things to follow an interest.    Host: Interesting.  So, what's interesting about that is you actually went into zoology when you went to college, right.  That was interesting, why zoology.    Mike Barratt: Well, so I think to go upfront a little bit one of the things that characterizes us here in any astronaut office in the Johnson Space Center in general is that we have a lot of broad interests, and we followed a lot of different paths growing up.  And the space program puts that all together.  So, at various times in my life, I wanted only to be an astronomer and I was building telescopes, including grinding mirrors.  Which I'll never do again, but it was a great experience to do.  And marine biology was my passion for several years.  And so, I came out of high school with that as a career goal.  And the University of Washington at the time, they didn't actually have a marine biology track per se, but you could do zoology with a marine emphasis.  And so, that's what I did.    Host: Okay.  Were you still playing around telescopes, then?    Mike Barratt: Absolutely.  There was a lot more light pollution in Seattle than on the farm in southwest Washington.  But sure, I mean I kept all these other passions alive and just looked for a way to combine them a guess.    Host: Yeah, now what's interesting after that, is you know you finding a way to get into this marine biology field, but it was later that you decided to take a turn toward the medical route.  What kind of influenced that?    Mike Barratt: Wow.  Well, the truth of the story is that I met this cute girl in college who was going to medical school and she had that as her focus since she was in third grade.  And so, I decided if I wanted her, I'm going to have to follow her to medical school.  I tell you that's at least half the story.  But, as I was going through biology classes and just learning about the human body, anatomy and physiology and thinking about that in light of some of my other passions.  which were astronomy, and space, and aviation.  I had been through ground school by that time, and marine biology.  I started kind of nurturing this interest in what the human is like in all these different environments.  And so, it seemed to me that medicine might be a place to combine a lot of my interests.  And basically, followed my wife to medical school.  By the way, we just celebrated number 37 here recently, so.    Host: Wow, congratulations.    Mike Barratt: It's been a lot of fun.    Host: All right.  So, you followed the cute girl and then locked her down [laughter].    Mike Barratt: Yeah, absolutely.    >1> Very good.  All right.  So, you're changing your path a little bit and then, eventually it sounds like you're finding different pieces of influence that are kind of taking a left turn on your career path.  You started with this marine biology, now you're going into medicine.  When did you start seeing aerospace medicine?  It sounds like you were a pilot too, so maybe that was part of the influence.  But aerospace medicine.    Mike Barratt: Well, to be sure I'd been through ground school.    Host: Oh, ground school, okay.    Mike Barratt: But I couldn't afford flying lessons.    Host: Oh, I see.    Mike Barratt: But I think life gives us these little seminal events and coincidences and whatnot.  And literally, one day while my soon-to-be wife and I were studying for the medical college admission test.  We were in the library at the University of Washington at the Medical Sciences Library and I got up to wander around for a study break.  And I discovered this journal, which was called \"Aviation, Space, and Environmental Medicine.\"  And it was just sitting in the journal stacks.  I had never heard of the journal.  I had never heard of aerospace medicine.  It was just very intriguing to me.  So, I grabbed one of these and I took it back to my little study carrel and I read it cover to cover.  And I had just never seen anything like this that combined all of these things.  Atmospheric, science, hyperbaric, hypobaric, diving medicine, altitude medicine.  All the extremes were all in one place.  And I probably got about as excited about any medical discovery right then and there as I ever have.   So, interestingly I just started to talk to people and obvious there's no Internet, then.  So, you're finding names and numbers in the phonebook and calling folks and speaking with those who are willing to talk to you, which most of them were.  And that's probably the event that started nurturing that interest in my senior year of college.    Host: What was it about the; you said they were extreme; combining all these extreme elements.  What was that?  What was the extreme part that was intriguing?    Mike Barratt: Well, you're basically looking at the medicine of human performance in places we are not optimally designed to be.  So, high altitude climbers, or war fighters at high altitude.  Divers, how deep can you go?  How do we adapt to different atmospheres?  Radiation?  All these things that induce environmental stresses on people were part and parcel to environments that we've chosen to operate in all these places that I mentioned.  So, the idea of a discipline, of a medical science that takes a very methodical approach to helping people do this I just thought was amazing.  It was about as cutting edge as you could get.    Host: Absolutely is it's entirely about pushing the boundaries of what the human body can; you're pushing it all these different, the word you used was extreme, extreme directions.  How much you know; can it take this amount of pressure?  How high can you go, you know?  What are all these environments that you can really test the human body in?    Mike Barratt: Right, absolutely.    Host: So, at what point did you find that NASA was a possibility.    Mike Barratt: Well, I think for a lot of us, growing up where I did when I did, NASA was this amazing entity that was soundly out of reach for most of us.  It's what the brightest and the best and all the cutting-edge people did.  But as I got a little bit closer into it.  As I got more research done and talked to more and more people, I realized that really the most fascinating aspect of all the environmental medicine out there was space.  It was that the microgravity aspect.  Potentially, hyper gravity when you're launching and landing.  Radiation.  And that just kind of what I wanted to do as I went through medical school.  And I think, you have to choose a medical specialty at the end of four years of medical school.  And I really still didn't know enough about aerospace medicine.  But what I could tell of the literature was that if I knew pathophysiology well it would prepare me the best if I wanted a career in aerospace medicine.  So, I made a deliberate choice to go into internal medicine at Northwestern in Chicago.   Just to learn that.  To really learn pathophysiology, learn how the humans adapt to certain illnesses, and how do we keep people healthy.  Which is a big focus of internal medicine.  And it was during that time that I established some closer ties with the aerospace medicine residency, in particular in Ohio.  Ad did finish up my pilot's license and moonlighting to pay for flying lessons actually.  And just gradually, over the years moved closer and closer to it.    Host: Was this whole pilot thing that you were kind of exploring, was it to, as you were kind of researching and learning about the pushing of the human boundaries, was it wanting to really just kind of see it for yourself maybe a little bit.    Mike Barratt: You know, is was partly that.  I still kind of thought that it was way above me.  But being able to do the medicine aspect of it.  I thought I could do.  And I thought it would be really, really interesting too.  But again, this was a relationship formed over years of talking to people.  And the closer I got, the more I realized that perhaps I could get a toehold in here.  And I absolutely loved flying.  And I think everybody I know that is a pilot is just passionate about being in here and controlling the machine and knowing how we perform up there.  So, this was a natural progression.    Host: Yeah, it's always just kind of described as like a naturally kind of freeing feeling.  You feel above everything.  Really, truly free.  So, you have your residency in internal medicine, now you're exploring aerospace medicine.  And that's where I think it was immediately after your aerospace residency right you kind of transitioned over to NASA.  Through it sounds like talking to those people.    Mike Barratt: Yeah, that's correct.    Host: So, what were you first doing at NASA?    Mike Barratt: So, when I first came down here, I was employed by a contractor which was Krug Life Sciences, at the time, which is now Wyle, KBRWyle to be precise.  But that was at a time when we were still working towards the Space Station Freedom project, which was a Ronald Raegan era, Cold War, massive international project to be done in space.  And already by that time, geopolitical influences were having a big effect on the space program and a lot of our careers.  So, the Cold War was pretty much coming to a close when I first came here in 1991.  And Space Station Freedom was really looked at for its potential contribution, both to science and geopolitical stability.  The day I arrived here, which I believe was in May 1991, the house had just passed by one vote to continue Space Station Freedom in a very limited fashion.  and you could tell that the support for it was waning.  No question about it.  And I came down here as a project physician working on the hyperbaric airlock for Space Station Freedom.   And over the course of that year, the Space Station Freedom Project pretty much folded.  And we anticipated that, we knew that was going to happen.  But there was a lot of misdirection and people were really not sure what was going on.  That was a very good year for me though, in that I realized that whatever training I had had, which was 10 years beyond college, by the way, was not really suitable to start being useful immediately.  There's so much specific knowledge you need down here.  It was easily a year before I felt that I was useful, that I kind of passed the breakeven point and was contributing more than I was learning.  So, in a way that formative year helped me direct myself and helped, at a time that NASA was directing itself, helped us all kind of get on the same page.  And so, I became a NASA flight surgeon in 1992, and at that time we were just starting the US Russian Program.  And I had always been intrigued by the Russian Space Program ever since the Apollo-Soyuz mission that was done during the Cold War and showed what was possibly as corroboration.   And so, when people came and said who would like to go to Russia, or start working with Russia in Spaceflight?  Boy, not too many people raised their hands.  But myself, and another younger flight surgeon at the time were just enthralled by the prospect.  And we started working really 1992/1993 with the joint US Russian program.  And that was probably the biggest influence on the remainder of my career here.    Host: Yeah, so it was kind of your first steps into, or was it actually your first steps into international collaboration, and really travelling?    Mike Barratt: Certainly, for me.    Host: Yeah, so how was that?  That introduction into that world?    Mike Barratt: It was amazing for me.  It was very intriguing to meet our first Russian specialist, that was in 1992.  And I can tell you, Igor Goncharov who I met in 1992.  I started a friendship with and I will just tell you that it went a long time and he was at my landing in 2009 as a recovering medical officer.  It was just an amazing relationship that we formed.  And in 1993, I made my first trip to Russian and was one of the first Americans to be at a Soyuz landing actually at that time.  Now, the irony is that we had already started thinking about using the Soyuz as a rescue vehicle from Space Station Freedom.  And we had originally said, no, it doesn't meet our requirements, and the answer was, well go anyway and see what it's like.  And we've since then, just formed a tremendous amount of respect for that vehicle.  But to be there and to see it.  And to be in Star City at a time when it still wasn't on the maps.  It was still kind of the secret city that everybody knew about in this post-Cold War era, was just an amazing enthralling thing.    Host: Yeah.  You're part of something much bigger.  You're part something kind of worldly I guess.    Mike Barratt: Yeah, we didn't think about that at the time because there were so many things against us.  We thought that our program would crash and burn, but we kept working at it pretty hard.  And it just formed into something big.  So, it was really quite wonderful.    Host: So, through this, you're checking out the international relations.  You're really checking out all of these vehicles and understanding space flight from the flight surgeon perspective.  Now, at what point do you start working with the crew?  Because I know that there's a point here where you start being a crew surgeon as well.    Mike Barratt: Right, so early on, in 1992, we started working with the first Russian cosmonaut, that was Sergei Krikalev, by the way, to fly on a shuttle mission.  And so, since I was already forming ties with the Russian program, I became deputy crew surgeon for that mission.  Which I think it was STS 60.  So, we'll find out.  Ironically commanded by Charlie Bolden.  And that's how I got to know Charlie Bolden pretty well.  And we knew that that was the first part of our exchange program.  That we were flying Russian cosmonauts on shuttle, we were also going to be flying a US astronaut on the Russian Mir Station, that was Norm Thagard as the first person.  And so, my first crew surgeon assignment as deputy on that mission was both an awakening really to what it's like to care for and feed a crew, and to see them end to end.  You're the last to see them before launch, and pretty much the first to see them after landing.  And you're speaking to them every day.  I mean it's really quite exciting.  And it's an amazing part of a flight surgeon's life.  At the same time, healthy sprinkling of the international aspect of what we were doing, the US Russian.   So, for me, those two experiences developed; started and developed together.  And I can't think of taking care of crews that aren't international because of that.  And really that's been quite a wonderful aspect of what we did.  And so, after that mission, we started gearing up more towards flying Norm Thagard on the Mir Station, and he launched in 1995.  So, between those two points, I spent a huge amount of time in Russia.  Like, I think over a year getting ready for it, doing rotations over there, doing medical support for training and the field exercises, survival.  And learn to get certified as a flight controller in the Russian Flight Control Center.    Host: Wow, really expanding your skills kind of all over the place.  You know, we're starting, I'm thinking back to where we started with your interest in marine biology, and now you're going through all these different medicine operations, you're looking at the vehicle itself.  You're kind of all over the place, this is quite fascinating to have such a broad perspective of things.    Mike Barratt: Yeah, well we were young and crazy.  There were, all a team of us actually that included my partner, David Ward, who's also a young flight surgeon interest in Russia.  Peggy Whitson who in charge of the science aspect of our joint US Russian program and I was more the med ops lead.  And John McBrian, who's a legend around here, just a logistics person, well known to the international committee.  And we had this small team that just figured that everything would work out and we just kept busting chops to make it all happen.  And lo and behold, it did.    Host: All right.  Was it this, y our introduction to this kind of broader world and an understanding is that you really realized that astronaut was actually on the table?    Mike Barratt: Actually, it was probably even later than that.    Host: Really?    Mike Barratt: We flew the first mission, and it went very well.  Not without a hitch, but it went very well.  Of a US astronaut in the Mir Station.  And the more I worked with Russia, the more I worked with long-duration, the more I realized that in the big picture of space flight, of exploration, of human expansion if you will.  Long-duration flight is how we're going to get somewhere.  And in some ways, it was much more intriguing to me than the short duration shuttle flights that we were doing.  Now, these were fantastic, make no mistake.  These were short, and dense, and science packed, and very high profile.  It looked like people were having a lot of fun.  But the kind of the brute force reality of how the human adapts to weightlessness over months, of longer periods of times, commensurate with a deep space crew's phase to Mars, for instance.  That's what really started to intrigue me.  So, it was a combination of that and my role as an educator, if you will.  Teaching the astronauts what their body is going to do in space.   So, in some ways, I kind of felt a little bit like a dork saying you know this is what's going to happen to your body in space, but I've never been there so trust me.  This is just what we know based on best available information and best stories we get from you guys.  So, I realized that to fulfill my ultimate dream of understanding space medicine, I would really have to go there myself.  So, I put my hat in the ring first for the 1998 selection.  And I was massively busy at the time.  And really just put that in very quickly.  And I did interview at that time.  I did not day get in.  But I wasn't dissuaded and just kept it in there.  I still didn't have any inkling that I would get accepted, that still seemed quite a bit out of reach to me.  But that in the year 2000, well lo and behold, I got picked.    Host: Wow.  All right, so that must have been quite an achievement for you to put it in a second time and finally get that call.    Mike Barratt: Yeah, well, there were certainly people got on their first time.  And people who got in after six times.  And so, I felt incredibly lucky, no question about it.    Host: So, going through the training, and we've talked about astronaut training a lot on this podcast.  But, you know, a lot from you have a different perspective, being a flight surgeon first and understanding how the human body reacts and what you're really training for, especially from a human research sort of perspective.  What was your perspective as a flight surgeon turned astronaut, as you were going through the training, kind of maybe you had a different perspective than maybe other astronauts in your same class too.    Mike Barratt: Well, sure everybody comes with sets of perspectives.    Host: Sure.    Mike Barratt: There's no question, based on their experience and their impressions.  I will tell you that I missed my old job tremendously.    Host: Oh, really?    Mike Barratt: For the first few years.  Don't get me wrong, it was exciting to be in the astronaut office and I had an amazing class.  The 17-member class of 2000.  Best class ever, in fact.  But wow.  I was gearing up to get the medical system going for the ISS, which launched the first crew that same year.  And so, after years and years of work and anticipation, and putting this all together, knowing the crews.  Working with them in Russia.  The US and the Russian crews and other international folks.  All of a sudden, right on the cusp of launch I'm yanked away into the astronaut office.  So, that was not easy.  I will be very upfront about that.  But, yes indeed I had a different perspective because I knew a little bit more about how the human performs.  And I knew Russia.  And I knew Russian.  And there were a lot of aspects of the program that were very familiar to me.  However, everybody comes with their own skillsets and deficits.  And I'm not an engineer.  So, a lot of what you're learning is systems engineering in Astro 101.   So, we had to learn shuttle systems and station systems.  And that there were certainly places where I was at an advantage.  Those were not them.  And so, certain things I could skip out of class and other things I had to work twice as hard as my classmates.    Host: Yeah, now that's actually an interesting perspective.  Because a lot of astronauts you talk to now, I mean Russian is one of the hardest things to learn.  Just because you know, they've lived in the engineering time for a long time and getting used to that is maybe a little bit easier than it is for you.  But you've actually had the Russian training.  And so, extra Russian training was just, you know.  Yeah, I guess it was a little bit easier of a transition than learning something out of, I guess your field.    Mike Barratt: Yeah, to a point.  I think medical people are used to memorizing big reams of information quickly and used to communicating.  And I was kind of a language dweeb anyway.  So, I thought, yeah, I got this great advantage.  I speak Russian.  Well, that was an advantage for about 400 milliseconds when we started learning all the other stuff.  The engineering and whatnot.  Obviously, I did not have the advantage.  So, we balanced each other out I think, quite well.    Host: Yeah, now you're going through the training and then you finally launch to the International Space Station.  Your first mission is on a Soyuz and it's a long-duration mission.  It's one of the expeditions you were talking about.  Where you're up on the station for a long time.  Now being a flight surgeon turned astronaut, what was that experience like for you?    Mike Barratt: Well, that was in 2009.  I'll preface that by saying I had actually finished and released the first edition of a textbook on space medicine the year before I launched in 2008.  So, this is \"Principles of Clinical Medicine for Spaceflight.\"  It's not a \"New York Times\" Bestseller.  I'm sure you've never heard of it.  But it did the best we could at the time to put a standard of care together for space medicine.  And I had some very talented authors who are you know cutting-edge in the research and the practice of their time.  And so, I launched with a lot of anticipation, thinking did I get this all right.  What's it really going to be like when I get up there?  What's the personal experience going to be like?  And maybe 6.5 months later into flight I could say I got about 80% right.  About 85% right.  And knowing that there's a big chasm between the book learning, which you may see realized and the personal experience.  Which is often quite a bit more visceral and personal than you can describe in the book.   So, I was going up there with a naturalist's eye.  Trying to look at myself and look at others to see what adaptation was really like.  And so, I think partly there were days where I thought, yeah, we got this right.  And pats on our backs and we're going to make this.  And then there were other days where, boy we sure didn't see that coming.  We had no idea.    Host: Yeah, now 20% that's a decent chunk.  Now, living it, there's all these things that you can anticipate, and research, and find out.  But once you live it, it kind of surprises you.  What were some of the things that really kind of, what was that 20%?  That 20% that really surprised you?    Mike Barratt: Well, one thing right off was how well we adapt to be three-dimensional creatures.  We have known that we don't understand how the balance system, neuro vestibular organs and other parts of your body that determine your sense of position, your sense of motion control, mass handling.  We knew that we didn't really understand the mechanisms of that adaptation.  And that we thought that to be a particular hazard that people could potentially get disoriented and cause erroneous commands.  Because we're not aware of our positional since when we're either docking a vehicle or manning a robotic arm.  In reality, over a period of days to weeks, we adapt incredibly well to be three-dimensional.  We don't know how.  In fact, you could almost say we don't know why we can do this.  But after a period of a few weeks, and I think it takes about six weeks for a first-time flyer.  We enter this stage of what my friend Shannon Lucid coned deep adaptation.  Whereby you go into a module that's clocked differently and you can immediately change your reference frame.   Or, you find people that just move upside down in a module and take their reference frame with them and are incredibly comfortable with this new three-dimensional environment or can manage things in three dimensions.  You don't just put something down on the table, it will float away.  But you're always mindful of where that thing is in three dimensions.  There's many other aspects to that, but we adapt quite amazingly to three dimensions, much more deeply than I would have thought possible.  But really, the bit thing was, when I was flying, we kind of started breaking the story on a new entity, which has been called many things, vision impairment and cranial pressure, and now more recently spaceflight associated neuro ocular syndrome.  But it was during our mission, myself, and one of my crewmates who's also a physician Bob Thirsk, noticed that our near visual acuity was decreasing, deteriorating and we needed stronger magnification to read our checklists.  And we heard stories of this before.  We knew that we often had to fly glasses of stronger magnification for people.   We just didn't know why.  In fact, we call them anticipatory glasses, but we didn't know why.  So, we got out the old ophthalmoscope, which is this little item that helps you see the back of someone's retina.  And said, are we not physicians after all?  Let's take a look at each other.  And lo and behold, it looked like there was a little bit of swelling of the optic disc for both of us.  And we did some other tests onboard.  And our ground crew fast-tracked some other equipment to us, high resolution imagery of the retina actually was what we really needed, and they gave us a little camera to do that within six weeks, which is a record.  And we started unwrapping the whole constellation of findings that go with this syndrome that was really not described until that time.  So, while we're up there, we're finding these findings like flattening of the globe of the eye, which changes your focus, which is a lot of why our near vision was deteriorating.  We found swelling of the optic nerve sheath.  The coating around the optic nerve.  We found changes in the retina and little bits of swelling of the optic disc.   And these are big things.  These are huge things.  And the question is, is this Bob and Mike and something that's going on with them?  Or is this something that we've missed for all these years and now we have the tools to see it/ Well, as it turns out it's the latter.  And when you think about it, this is such a large thing that's no doubt a manifestation of adapting to zero gravity that we just were seeing for the first time.  What else is out there that we're missing?  This is a big thing.  It effects very crucial parts of a person's anatomy.  And what else are we missing that we just haven't had the tools to find?  So, it was both a discovery and a realization that there's still much more to learn.  So, I think when I landed, I probably landed with even a bigger gap in the space medical knowledge than what I thought after maybe the first half of the mission that I was there.    Host: Yeah, more questions than answers.  Kind of opens up this whole idea of yeah, right what else is happening?    Mike Barratt: Right, and by the way, that has been our second largest risk now, next to radiation, it's one of our largest focuses of research since that time.    Host: Is that vision studies?    Mike Barratt: Yeah, absolutely.    Host: Yeah, yeah.  No, well just from what you're describing, I mean there's a little bit of a positive and a negative right, the three-dimensional space.  You're like what is happening to the vestibular system that's whether you know you're oriented, how you do your balance, but it seems like you can navigate better than you originally thought.  Upside down.  You know where you're going, you know where things are better than you originally thought.  So, I guess that's a positive thing.  But the vision thing, that's going to be a challenge.    Mike Barratt: Yeah, and by the three-dimensional awareness, you pay for that when you come home.  Because you have to adapt the other direction, and what makes you incredibly adaptive in space becomes very maladaptive on day one when you land.    Host: That's right.  And this will be a consideration for space travel too.    Mike Barratt: Absolutely.    Host: Because you're going to have to realize that you're going from one environment, which maybe you know zero gravity, microgravity, whatever in transit to a planet.  And then, once you land now you have to adapt to the gravity of this new planet.  And so, does your balance.    Mike Barratt: Right, absolutely.    Host: So, you had a couple spaceflights and had these realizations.  Now during the long-duration spaceflight what was the comparison to your next flight, the short duration?    Mike Barratt: Well, interestingly, I was assigned to the short duration flight before I landed from first long-duration flight.  So, I knew I was going to have that data point.  And it was a totally different vehicle.  So, it was more than just the short duration in space.  The launch, and landing, the vibe of that mission, the STS 133 was totally different.  Everything was in English.  Everything was at home.  I didn't have to travel.  And I had this amazing crew of people.  And we were asked to be chosen to be that the last space shuttle crew.  And we had our pictures taken with Bob Crippen and John Yong as the first space shuttle crew.  And we were lining up all that PR aspect of it all.  Lo and behold Congress wanted two more shuttle missions after that.  Which did a couple things.  It meant that we weren't the last, but it also took all the pressure and spotlight off of us and made for a very relaxed training flow.  And the mission was just absolutely fabulous.  But I'll tell you, it was great to launch in the shuttle.  It's a very different vehicle.  It was quite an honor, actually, to be on one of those last shuttle missions.   And to have that much room during the two-day chase.  It's quite a bit larger than the Soyuz.  And to be back on station again felt like a homecoming to be real honest.  It was about a year and a half between when I landed from the long one and when we launched.  Not quite a year and a half.  But when we opened the hatch, it just felt so familiar.  It felt like a homecoming in many ways.  I knew my way around.  I knew how to get from one handrail to another.  I know where you could go fast, where you needed to go slow.  Where the food was.  I mean the aroma when we opened the hatch was so familiar, it just felt like home and so that was really an amazing aspect of it.  And it was busy.  It was a two-week dock time period almost.  We had a 13-day mission altogether.  It's an interesting perception for some people that the shuttle missions were sprints and the station missions were marathons.  I do like to remind people that a marathon means you're still running.  And when we had our visiting shuttle missions, which were two of them when I was on my long flight.   We were actually working longer days than our shuttle counterparts for all sorts of reasons.  But, again, you're very effective when you've been up there for months.  You can get a lot done in a day.  And we've all kind of seen that now.  And so, I thought about that a lot as a visiting shuttle member, subsequently, that I wanted to be a good guest.  And that we wanted to make sure that we were all working together as a team and not be burdensome on the station crew.  And I think that was a good realization at the time.  But otherwise, it was just fabulous.  There were about 12 of us on the station.  Very international crew.  Russians, US, an Italian, Paolo Nespoli.  And a really fabulous mission.    Host: Incredible.  So, Mike with that, you actually have some experience in HRP.  We were working with HRP now to put together sort of the way they've done it, is they've categorized hazards of human spaceflight into five different hazards.  And I guess they are sort of environmental hazards.  They did it based on radiation, isolation, confinement, distance from Earth, altered gravity fields, and then the last one is a hostile or closed environment.  And it's sort of how this effects the human body, which you know, since you've actually been in space, but then also worked with HRP.  So, let's just go through those hazards and just sort of expand on that starting with radiation.  The radiation environment of space.  Why is that a hazard to us?    Mike Barratt: Okay, well, all of these physical hazards kind of account for the physiological changes and the medical changes we see.  Each one of them cascades down along several lines, which can cause changes and sometimes harmful effects to us .  Radiation is an interesting phenomenon because we sometimes think of space as being filled with radiation.  When really, the correct way to think about that is Earth being a hardened shelter to radiation.  We just happen to live and grow up in this bunker.  Which shields us from what the rest of the universe is bathed in all the time.  And so, if we want to be space farers, then radiation is just a fact of life.  It's how we're going to get somewhere.  Radiation can hurt us on many levels.  We worry about solar flares, which can cause a large number of particles, charged particles, protons, electrons, alpha particles, which can actually cause acute radiation sickness.  And depending on the dose, that can be very mild, like you never notice it.  Or can be lethal.   Everything in between.  And then we worry about long-term risk of cancer and increased risk of heart disease.  And some other things as well.  Including effects on the brain.  So, there's many ways that radiation can hurt us, but it is one thing that we absolutely have to solve.  And when you think about being a spacefaring civilization, multi-planet, you have to envision yourself moving from one bunker to another.  So that what we have on Earth that shields us from a lot of electromagnetic radiation, cosmic rays and solar particles, we will need to re-create the best we can, wherever we're going.  And so, for places without atmospheres and magnetic fields, will depend much more on matter, on say burrowing underground to get some material that shields us from that for most of the time that we live there.    Host: Yeah, you're literally using, I guess the plant itself to sort of protect you, because there's especially, you know, you're talking about Earth being a bunker, you've got the magnetic field that's really protecting you.  But on Mars, not so much.  On the moon, not so much.  Yeah, you're not going to have that same protection.    Mike Barratt: Right, so unfortunately, the places of interest to us don't shelter us quite as much as mother Earth.  And I think it's a good point that finding a Goldilocks planet that affords everything they we're used to as we grew up and developed here is pretty unlikely.  So, we'll be settling for aspects of the fundamental aspects that we live under that we can live with and then try to make up for those that we don't have.  So, radiation shielding might be one of those.    Host: So, let's start with sort of low Earth orbits, since that's actually where you did spend some time.  What's the difference between the radiation environment of low Earth orbit, and say around the moon?    Mike Barratt: Well, so in low Earth orbit, you're above the atmosphere, which is highly protective of radiation.  So, you lose that.  However, you are still underneath the magnetic fields, the geomagnetic fields that protect our planet are held in place.  They're basically, I think of it as a fire shield.  It's basically charged particles held in a magnetic field that if you get too close to you get burned, but the fire keeps the bad things away.  So that the high energy galactic cosmic rays are largely stopped by that geomagnetic field, certainly at the latitudes of the orbits that we fly in.  So, that's very helpful.  Once you get out of those magnetic fields, then you are vulnerable to the full force of galactic cosmic rays and solar particle events.  In fact, from a human standpoint, we sometimes consider that extra-geomagnetic space.  Because it gives you that clear delineation that we are now outside of our little shielded area.    Host: So, what exactly?  You said, you know, from small effects to you know lethal effects of radiation.  What exactly is radiation doing to the human body?    Mike Barratt: So, when we think about spaceflight radiation, we're mostly concerned with charged particles, which are electrons, and protons, and some heavier particles that are basically stellar products coming from supernova explosions and energized gas clouds.  And the I'll have to caveat that by saying we also have issues with neutrons.  Because those can be formed by interaction of these heavy particles with structure.  But these are traveling very fast.  And they possess a lot of energy.  And so, when they hit something that's of value to us, such as macromolecules, like DNA, they can actually induce direct damage.  And if you get a large enough dose they can actually kill cells.  It's some of those smaller doses that we're a little bit concerned about.  Because they can damage DNA in such a way, in fact many different ways that can potentially cause cancers, cause the lethality from cancers.  Many years after your exposures.  And there's a lot of uncertainty about what does and what charged particle will affect, will cause what effect on the human body.   And so, that's one of our major areas of interest in research.    Host: Do we have radiation studies on the International Space Station?    Mike Barratt: Absolutely.  So, just like a radiation technologist or nuclear energy worker, we have a very highly monitored environment.  And every crew there were the radiation badge just like any of those people in those industries that I mentioned.  We have area detectors which map out the radiation exposure of each area of the Space Station.  And we have, furthering our suite of detectors, charged particle directional detectors.  Which tell you what the charges are and from what direction they come.  And those are the particles that that come in from the sun and from galactic cosmic rays.  And of course, we have our ground observations.  We composite all those together, along with satellite data as well.  And we get the best picture we can of the radiation environment for low Earth orbit.    Host: So, sticking with the International Space Station, moving on to this this next hazard, which is isolation and confinement.  This is an interesting one, because you are isolated, and I guess confined on the Space Station.  It's a relatively large structure, especially for a space structure and historically the ones that we've actually flown on.  But how is you know, how is that an isolated and confined environment and then versus what we can be looking towards for future missions?    Mike Barratt: Well, it's an interesting question because when we look at the ISS as a space platform it is, by far the largest space platform we've ever had.  And are likely to have for a long, long time.  You know I lived on the Space Station for nearly 200 days in 2009.  And really loved living there.  There's no question about it.  But I was lucky enough to come back in about a year and a half.  And one of my classmates, Steve Bowen was with me.  And he is a submariner by training.  He was a Navy officer on the Virginia Class attack boats.  And he and I flew around the station the first day after we had docked the Shuttle Discovery to it.  And I just asked him, if this were one of your submarines, how many people would you have been in a volume this size.  And he thought for a minute and said about 130, or so.  So, our standard crew size on the station is six.  And boy, and we have zero gravity, which means you can use the volume in three dimensions.  So, we really have it pretty good up there.  So, there's many aspects that make the station extremely habitable.   Largely its size, it's big and there's plenty of space.  If you want privacy you can have it.  It's possible to go for hours without seeing another person, if you are very concentrating on an experiment or doing some of your work that just keeps you in one place for long time.  The other thing about it though, is that if you look out the window you have this magnificent view of mother Earth.  And so, there's a bigness and there's a closeness.  And not only are you overwhelmed by the proximity of the Earth, you also know that you can get there fairly quickly if you need to.  If, God forbid we ever had an emergency on the station, it caught fire and became uninhabitable, we know we can be home within hours.  And safely.  And that gives you a lot of comfort and it gives you a lot of closeness to Earth.  So, it is large, and confined in that you can't go outside anytime you want.  You can't always just come home anytime you want.  But still you have those factors I mentioned that make it very habitable.  Now, one other point I like to make is people think we're a long way away, and they use the term outer space.   Even my mom said I was in outer space for six months.  But you know, we're not that far away.  I mean, we're 240 nautical miles above the surface.  Which is about I don't know, maybe a little more than from here to Austin.  And what separates us is not so much that distance barrier, as a speed barrier.  A velocity barrier.  Because to be in orbit, we're traveling 17,500 miles an hour.  And we had to accelerate to get there.  And, conversely, to come home, we have to decelerate.  We have to slow down from 17,500 to 0.  And so, it's really not the distance barrier so much as the speed barrier that that separates us.  And that will become very different when we break orbit and I head for Mars.    Host: Did you ever feel isolated on the Space Station, or maybe because it's so close that maybe you felt pretty connected.    Mike Barratt: I think that the only times I ever felt isolated up there was when I knew there were events going on on the ground that I really wanted to be a part of.  Mostly family events.  Other than that, not really for two reasons.  You know, number one, all those habitability factors that I mentioned.  But number two, where you are is just so magical.  I mean, it captivates you.  You are mostly feeling how amazing it is to be where you are and feel what you're feeling and see what you're seeing than you are wishing that you were elsewhere.    Host: So, you said, I mean there was only six people on this giant spacecraft, and you had a lot of rooms and you had three dimensions of room too, you know you don't have to worry about just walking on the floor, you have all surfaces to work with.  So, confinement doesn't really seem like much of an issue from your perspective on the Space Station.  Now, if you're going further out, is there an optimal level of space, I guess that you would need as a human to operate and feel comfortable in the spacecraft for long-duration missions?  Especially on a Mars transit that can go somewhere up to nine months in a single spacecraft without really having the ability to go outside for a walk and some fresh air.    Mike Barratt: Yeah, that's a great question.  I think it's safe to say just holistically that as soon as you break orbit and head for Mars, all those habitability factors start going downhill for all sorts of reasons.  Now of the Station is huge.  It's much larger than anything we would be throwing to Mars or any other exploration venue anytime soon.  And at the Human Research Program level we actually had a research focus on what we called minimum habitable volume.  In other words, what's the minimum we would need to maintain a crew's health and performance in some of these deep space conditions.  Now, I will point out that there is no maximum habitable volume that we're trying to determine.  So basically, the bigger the better.  That's not our problem.  That's not the end where we have our issues.  Obviously to throw a mass to Mars is going to be highly constraining.  And so, the ship that goes to Mars, not only will it be truly isolated, you can't be home in several hours.  There is no real-time communication.  You don't have that tremendous view of mother Earth, always there just making you feel connected to your home planet, but your volume will be quite small by necessity.   And coming up with that minimal habitable volume is a bit of a daunting task because there's a certain amount of subjectivity to it.  So, the answer is from a habitability standpoint as big as possible, but that will be severely constrained.  And so, what I think we'll get is a reasonable volume envelope based on the mass we're able to throw, and the life-support systems we have to accommodate.  And with that volume, we'll try our best to make it as habitable as possible.    Host: Now you have to assume that the astronauts going on that mission to Mars are going to be, you can assume the best of the best.  They're going to be a great crew; well, we can hope [laughter], we can home.  And they're going to be able to get along with each other and I think that's a big component as well is being confined in a space where mass is a huge constraint, space is a huge constraint for these long-duration missions.  Now, you're not only talking about confined, habitable volume and livable volume, but livable volume with other people.    Mike Barratt: Right, that's absolutely right.  But I think that a couple of things.  You will be building expectations of the crew that goes to Mars in a way that will prepare them for this experience.  And they'll know what they're getting into.  Just as we do on Space Station.  And NASA has been working very hard to develop training scenarios that build these expeditionary behaviors.  One of those is coping with relatively small volumes.  And getting along with each other.  There's no question about it that you will have to do some special preparation.  But I'm actually fairly confident that that is something we can do.  Because that's been done in history before.  Certainly, in Arctic stations and small oceangoing craft, we've proven as a species that we can tolerate fairly austere conditions as long as we're prepared and can get along with it.  Now, I think building some degree of privacy is prudent.  But I think we can do that in a much smaller space than we have with the ISS.    Host: Okay.  Now in terms of isolation, as you get further and further away from Earth so does the time it takes to communicate with Earth.  On Space Station, it's relatively easy, almost instantaneous, really close to it.  So, talking with people is easy.  As you go further and further away now you have this delay.  Is there a certain level of; well we'll start with this.  Is there a certain level of communication that's needed to maintain the crew's health?  And feeling like they're still connected and not so far away from Earth?    Mike Barratt: I think that as we move towards exploration of deep space we have to actually look backward not forward for the answers to some of these problems.  Now, if you were to look at what I consider one of the greatest voyages of discovery of all time, Captain Cook's circumnavigation aboard Endeavor, where they were lucky to find a merchant ship or a whaleship that might be going to their homeport, maybe years into their voyage.  The crew would draft some letters hand that to them and hold that the ship would make it there safely sometime in the next year.  And that letter writing campaign was kind of how things were done.  If you were to tell them they, hey look, we've got a system where given a few minutes to several hours you can get a message back to Greenwich and then they can communicate with you before the day is out.  They wouldn't have believed you.  So basically, what we have is a revolutionary capability compared to the means that supported exploration missions for centuries.   And so, can we do it?  Of course, we have.  We can do that.  Now, we have to crew, and we have to design accordingly.  And really move toward more mission autonomy.  And we've spoiled ourselves in a way, by having such broad bandwidth and real-time communication for the Station.  But Station is a laboratory.  And it is designed to produce as much science as possible.  And that really depends on a real-time communication, whereas heading to Mars and some of the other deep space destination, we're not in that paradigm.  We are really all about exploring and what we need to do in maintaining the ship, and maintaining the crew, and supporting the mission.  Most of that responsibility has to really be given to the crew.  Certainly, for any immediate responses that need to happen, that all has to be the crew.  Just like it used to be.    Host: Yeah, and it blends in nicely to this to his next hazard, which is distance from Earth.  And I think, you know, we sort of already talked about that the further you are away, the more delay there is communication.  So, communication is one of the factors that goes hand-in-hand with distance.  The further out you go, the longer the delay of communication.  What are some other factors whenever you're talking about the human body, the human really being further, and further, father away from Earth.    Mike Barratt: Well, I think there's that many aspects to that.  One I have to kind of think about the medical issues that we know our crews are going to be healthy when we launch them and we're going to do our best to keep them healthy during flight with countermeasures and diet and medical monitoring.  But if an acute event happens, somebody for instance starts clutching their lower abdomen and peeing out blood and we think there's a kidney stone, you know that could definitely happen.  So, in this case, instead of getting a panic call to the ground, asking immediately to talk to the surgeon, what we may get is a report saying, crew member so and so was clutching their abdomen, in very bad pain.  We pulled out the ultrasound, we found a stone.  We think it's passing.  We've given pain meds and they're resting comfortably.  That's the kind of paradigm that we're moving to.  So, that the crew members, again, are able to respond to an event and handle it the best they can.  And give us reports and ask for advice.  So, to speak.  Consultation, rather than real-time guidance.  And that again, is very exploration-oriented.   And if we have a whatever, settlement, or colony, or outpost n on Mars, that's the paradigm.  So, that begins with the exploration transit.    Host: Yeah, there's a lot of factors that go into that.  Now, you have another base of knowledge that you have to have a baseline for whenever you go out.  Because instead of calling immediately to the ground like you said and getting the aid, the knowledge of the experts on the ground instantly.  Now you have to know sort of what to deal with.  And then, that mentality of not working together, the mentality of doing it yourself, and reporting the progress.    Mike Barratt: Which, truth be told, I think even crew members on Station right now, we understand that we're trying hard to produce science and having more consultation with the ground is really important.  But more crew autonomy is recommended by almost every crew who returns from Station.  Partly to enhance efficiency and partly for peace of mind.  But it is something that crew members really, I think naturally want and will move into quite nicely.  I have to think, I had a very small combustion event on the Space Station while I was up there, really almost nonconsequential.  But that piece of hardware on the Russian segment started bellowing smoke and overheating.  And of course, we were able to immediately call the ground.  And they knew about it immediately because of smoke detectors and whatnot.  And in this paradigm, it would have been a call back that maybe they would have found out between 8 and 22 minutes later that we have this little combustion event.  We pulled the circuit breakers.  This is what we found.  Everything is fine now.  We replaced the part that was burning, and we are in normal ops recovery.   How was your day.  So, again that's kind of the paradigm that we'll get to with exploration.    Host: Now, as we also go further out, you're talking about sort of your trajectory to get there is not flexible.  So, if you're going to Mars, that's it.  If you already lit your engines and you're on your way to mars, that's it, there's no turning back if there's something.  So, I'm assuming that that's part of living in that sort of environment, is knowing that once you're on your way to Mars, you're dedicated.    Mike Barratt: Yeah, absolutely.  And that, again, is something you prepare crews for ahead of time, that when you light those engines for your trans-Mars injection, there is a state of readiness at all levels.  All of your systems and your crew as well.  And so, that decision has already been made once those engines fire.  And that expectation is burned in.  And you know, there's an understanding that it will be a long trip, and you can't turn around, and you can't sightsee, or pull off to the side.  But that's mixed with the anticipation that you're going to Mars.  And that's pretty cool.    Host: Yeah, that is pretty cool.  And magical.  It's really, just to know that you're on your way is a fantastic step.    Mike Barratt: Yeah, absolutely.    Host: So, you know, based on that let's go to topic number for, which is altered gravity fields.  You're talking about for the International Space Station microgravity is what you're really operating.  Now, you've got sort of a similar environment on the way to Mars, but then you have to adjust on this six to nine-month journey to Mars, you have to adjust from that gravity, now down to Mars' gravity.  And we've learned from operating on the International Space Station and doing these long-duration missions that there's some significant effects on the human body whenever you're talking about gravity.    Mike Barratt: Right, well there certainly are.  So, it's very interesting because we grew up in one G, one gravity.  And our human body is quite amazing in its capacity to handle different orientations to gravity.  We lie down, we stand up and we maintain our blood pressure to our brain.  We maintain fluid regulation.  We're able to move with different loads.  We can run.  We can walk.  We can swim.  We're really quite amazing.  And when you get into zero gravity, the fact that we adapt to zero gravity is also quite amazing.  But it's a little bit easier to go from one G to zero G. Because you're going from a loaded state to an unloaded state and your balance gets wacked, but you can't fall because nothing falls up there.  It actually becomes a lot more exciting when you come from zero gravity back to 1G.  Now, the good news is that of the main problems that result from prolonged exposure to microgravity, and those being musculoskeletal weakness and problems with your heart pumping blood to your head, to your brain.   Which is what we call orthostatic tolerance, the ability to handle that gravitational challenge on your blood column and balance.  Two out of those three, we've actually made tremendous progress on over these years.  Largely because of some of the work we've done on the International Space Station.  So, because of our new countermeasures; heavy resistive exercise, heavy aerobic exercise, we come down pretty fit and strong.  And we have people coming down after six months with negligible bone loss.  Sometimes a few percent but certainly we're in a bracket now that has kind of revolutionized our understanding of maintaining a body in zero gravity.  And we have countermeasures for the orthostatic intolerance, which is caused by some of those adaptive changes; low circulating blood volume and lower red blood cells, and the conditions that in zero gravity decondition your neural circuits that let you stand up.  We have countermeasures.  We can fluid load.  We can increase your vascular volume a little bit.   We put on garments that squeeze our legs and keep the fluid where we want.  And there's other things we can do.  Interestingly, the balance issues that come from problems with our vestibular organs, which are our balance organs, and many other inputs that your brain integrates to determine where you are and what your motions like, those are things we don't really have countermeasures to.  And interestingly, now we're worrying quite a bit about those.  But I am amazed that we have the luxury of worrying really just about that one, whereas, we used to worry about three pretty handily.  So, not to trivialize that.  That is a big issue.  It's very difficult to move, to walk to do some of the most simply motor functions after a prolonged period in zero gravity.  Now, the good news is that the Mars is less gravity.  It's a little bit more than 1/3 of Earth's gravity.  And the big adaptive phase where it's very difficult to walk and whatnot, is a fairly short one on the order of a few days.   Certainly, several hours to a few days.  And so, we can wait it out, if we're careful and our landing craft on Mars is big enough to allow us to stick around.  And there may be some countermeasures that we can still develop.  And if the gravity field is quite a bit less, which one would expect would lessen the implications of it, and certainly would lessen the chances of injury on falling.  But one thing is you cannot expect people to land, put on their spacesuit and hike 5 kilometers to the lander that you've pre-staged there within the first few hours.    Host: So, there's going to have to be, built into the mission, and probably the hardware too, some sort of period of adaptation whenever you land on Mars to sort of, and you're talking about the order of a couple of days it seems like, to sort of get your new land legs, your Mars legs before you actually exit the capsule and start, like you said, put on your spacesuit and start walking around.    Mike Barratt: Yeah, that is a certainty.  I think a period of postlanding adaptation is an absolute certainty, which unfortunately drives a larger sized lander.  So, that does change your mission architecture.  Until, or unless we develop some type of magical countermeasure to those neuro vestibular problems that we are going to need to have.  And frankly, I don't think we have anything definitive on the horizon for that.  You cannot load yourself out of this problem, like you can with muscle and bone loss, and even blood loss.  You can load those back.  But this we can't.  And it's more than just the post landing period.  We've also wondered what are the human capabilities for piloting a spacecraft through the atmosphere of Mars, and that is very highly dependent on motor function.  And we definitely saw with the shuttle missions, which were short, but we definitely found that even the longer of the shuttle missions, which would have been a little over two weeks in duration, you could correlate with slightly decrease performance on manual landing tasks of the shuttle.  And we know that accumulates over time.   So, months and months of spaceflight, that's probably not a good time you want to have manual control of a spacecraft entering the atmosphere.    Host: Now, let's say you land on Mars and you've gone through this adaptation period.  Now your neuro vestibular system is back in balance and you're able to walk.  Is there still, I'm assuming, there might be exercise requirements whenever you're on the surface of Mars.  You still have 1/3 G and you have that constant load, but I'm assuming, you know, regular exercise will still be helpful, I wonder just how much.    Mike Barratt: Well, that's a great question.  So, we exercise in zero gravity, mostly because we know we're coming home.  I mean zero gravity is great, unless you want to come home.  And so, keeping bones and muscles, and cardiovascular system conditioned is really all about coming back to your home planet.  And it will be the same on Mars that you will absolutely want to exercise.  Because you know that eventually you want to come back to 1G, until we end up staying there for a little bit longer.  Now, the good news is that 1/3 of a G is quite a bit more than zero.  It's quite a bit more than lunar G. But, the important mechanical aspect of that is that it's all, we would say linear.  It's basically the center of the planet, there's a line between that and your belly button, your center of mass, around which you're going to orient your body, and carry loads, and do your exercises.  So basically, it's like being in familiar territory, you just have to dial up the loads more than you would have on the ground.   So, that if you had a universal gym, you just rack in more weights.  More likely we'll have bags of Martian regolith and we'll just pack those and lift those.  But it's all along the same vector that we're used to.  So, it vastly simplifies your performance of countermeasures.    Host:  Oh, that's right because instead of bringing weights with you, you use kind of the environment around, because mass is a huge concern just to get there.    Mike Barratt: Right, there's plenty of mass there, and we often, we think about artificial gravity in long transits in deep space and giving us that rotational centrifugal force which would put back some of those gravitational forces.  That's problematic in a lot of ways, with a spinning structure.  But once you get on the surface, you've got fractional gravity, but it's all linear, it's kind of nature's way, if you will.  So, that gives us something much easier to work with.    Host: Yeah, now how about, just real quick, you know, Mars mission there's a lot of concerns but we've already been to the moon.  Now, if you're talking about a moon, you know, let's say we have a habitat on the moon and we're living there for long-duration missions to sort of test out going even further out.  Now, what would that look like as compared to you know, adjusting from gravity.  Because the trip is much, much shorter.    Mike Barratt: Well, it's true we've already been to the moon, but you could also say that's similar to say, we've already been in low Earth orbit during the Gemini period.  And so, we knew that people could handle the environment and that most likely they could go longer.  But boy, there was a lot we didn't know until we start flying people long duration on Skylab and the Russian programs.  Mir station and ISS> so, the same will be true with the lunar gravity.  We will be able to work quickly there.  We'll be able to walk and explore.  We know that because of Apollo.  What we don't know really is what are the long-term effects of 16G and what are the countermeasures that we will in turn need.  And we'll add all sorts of other hazards with that.  There will be a vigorous EVA schedule.  Which is why we're there.  We're there to explore.  But it will be there in a gravity field with dust, and sharp edges, and tools, and all sorts of things that don't have to worry about with spacewalks on the Station right now.  And so there will be many different and new levels of hazard that we will have to learn very carefully on as we go.    Host: Yeah, and that kind of blends in nicely to this last topic, which is hostile enclosed environments.  Now you're talking about if you're going out for an EVA, now you're right.  You don't have the; you have to sure watch out for any micro meteoroid impacts or anything, but now you're talking about sharp regolith that you have to sort of deal with.    Mike Barratt: Well, you're talking about that, and frankly, I think your tools may be your biggest enemy.  Because you're going to be carrying tools to sample, or to construct, or to move, to repair, to build.  And that will add a whole new dimension to what we're doing.  Now, some of it will be easier just because you'll be able to keep track of everything.  Not everything has to be tethered.  And if you put a tool down somewhere in a safe place, it will stay there, and it will stay safe until you pick it up.  However, it will add the added risks of potentially falling.  Cycling your suit against a surface wear.  So, your boots and whatnot.  And one of the biggest factors that we'll have to deal with is dust; lunar dust.  And lunar dust is an amazing thing because even in our short-duration experience in the Apollo program, it was a big problem.  And I think it will be a bit problem for us as well.  Medically, probably the biggest hazard is how much that's going to interfere with ecosystem valves, fans, anything moving, anything that requires precision fits, which is about everything in spaceflight could potentially be a problem.   And then, airborne lunar dust with the low gravity and the electrostatically charged nature of this dust.  It floats and flies.  And we've done some early toxicity studies.  We don't really know the combination of the factors of lunar dust, toxicity itself, and 1/6th G and how that effects pulmonary ventilation and how those particles might distribute in the lung.  And so, we're now in kind of a new occupational medicine scenario, very similar to silica and coal dust in mines, were we're going to have be very careful about monitoring the effects of dust on lung function.    Host: Right and that kind of goes along with this other part of this topic, which is the closed environment part.  Humans are very picky compared to rovers that we've sent to Mars and to the moon, to really check out that environment, you really don't need life support systems, now you need to deal with the closed environment systems that provide pressure and oxygen.  And you need water.  You need food.  And you need to bring in all with you.  So, that's, I mean, that's got to be one of the; probably the toughest things is that whole human element of exploring.    Mike Barratt: Yeah, well the good news is that generic to almost every space exploration venue we think about.  So, we do need to develop that.  There's no question.  Now, the moon is a good practicing ground for Mars, because there's certain aspects that make the moon harder for long-term habitation.  There's less gravity, only 1/6 instead of a little over 1/3.  There's no atmosphere whatsoever.  Mars is very thin, but it actually does provide some protection from both charged particles and ultraviolet.  And boy, there's a lot of potential learning that will happen on the moon, that if we crack and solve will make things better.  We also, there may be water ice on the moon, which would be really great.  But we know there's water in abundance on Mars.  If we learn to use what small amounts we find on the moon, it will definitely make us better for in situ resource utilization on Mars.    Host: That's right.  Actually, living off the land.  Using your surroundings to.    Mike Barratt: The best we can.    Host: Exactly.  Now, I think one of the more interesting things is the fact that now if you have a human presence on Mars and let's say you have all your equipment, this is sort of I guess part of this topic being the hostile environment.  But it's a new environment.  Sure, you could map your surroundings, but ultimately if you're taking the steps towards this environment, this previously maybe mapped environment.  It is going to be new and you don't really know what you're going to find.    Mike Barratt: Yeah, absolutely right.  What I would like to say though is there is a combination for methods for learning that prep you for exploration.  One of those is what we're doing now.  As much as we can, research ahead of time.  But on the other hand, you can't wait until you know everything to go, otherwise you'll never go.  And you have to have a mindset of learn as you go.  And that has to be baked into your exploration.  So that when you're sending people up there, you know there's going to be some uncertainties.  What are the effects of 1/6th g, I mentioned the dust particles and what those are going to do to us.  So, you have to have a medical monitoring program baked into your exploration, so that you can find and collect these facts as you need to.  Now, all of us need to be naturalist with notebooks when we go explore.  And that includes dealing with medical problems as well.  Now, you don't want an obtrusive medical monitoring program.  You know, we're not going to make this a huge science program to start with.  But it's something they did quite magnificently I would say during the Apollo era.  That learn as you go mindset.   That basically gave results based on medical monitoring we did with all the crew members.  and as a result, we knew a lot coming out of Apollo, to a certain extent because of dedicated science, but to a large extent because of a very logical well applied medical monitoring program.  And that is something we'll absolutely need for going back to the lunar surface.    Host: Yeah, now in terms of the lunar surface, now jumping ahead to Mars, a closed environment.  Sure, you know what's nice about the moon I guess is that it's relatively close.  Not as close as the International Space Station but going back to this whole distance thing.  Mars is pretty far, which means not only do your closed environment systems have to work, they have to work reliably.  Because they have to work for years really.  But, so, how do you make sure that a system can be reliable enough to carry a human for that long?    Mike Barratt: Right.  Well, the operative phrase is reliable enough.  And that means reliable enough to take the risk and just go do it.  And try it.  And the way you make sure is to test everything and field test it as much as possible.  So that you're not putting a cutting-edge system out there that doesn't have years of space miles on it.  That's what you really need.  And that's one thing that the International Space Station is helping us with tremendously.  It becomes in a way, I like to think of it as a low Earth orbit wind tunnel.  Where you can take systems and really test them and shake them out.  And leave them there for crews to use and abuse for months to years at a time and prove that field history.  You know, we're pretty good at developing new systems, and putting cutting-edge technology together into a logical package.  But there's always stuff you don't know.  And you will only find that out when you start using it over time.  And that is exactly what we need to do before we send a system to Mars.    Host: I think that's a perfect place to end it.  It's just the fact that all of this, I mean eventually, you know, journeys to explore the moon on long-duration missions and to Mars to eventually put human boots on Mars.  There are hazards.  And the hazards we sort of list.  But ultimately, once we go and we learn.  I mean that's how you do it.  That's how you do it.    Mike Barratt: Yeah, absolutely right.  I think there's a lot of sentiment that we need to wait until we have everything done, everything together, everything figured out to keep crews healthy and happy on their way to Mars.  But if you look at the exploration archives of our civilization, healthy and happy were not big parts of long sea voyages, or Arctic voyages, or anything where information was found, new discoveries were made of value to us.  And so, we don't expect that on our first exploration sorties.  And we don't want to wait for that.  Healthy and happy is for the paying passengers that come maybe a generation afterwards once we have a settlement and a colony there.  But the we want to get to a point where it's reliable enough to take the risk and the crew is autonomous enough to handle most of those emergencies.  And just realize that nothing is certain, but the benefits and the potential discoveries make it worth the while.    Host: That was great.  Mike, thank you so much for coming on the podcast today, and sharing your story, and really going through these hazards, especially from your perspective as a space traveler yourself.  Really appreciate your time.    Mike Barratt: My pleasure.     [ Music ]    Host: Hey, thanks for sticking around.  So, today we talked with Dr. Mike Barratt about his story traveling to the International Space Station and also his view of the five hazards of human spaceflight.  That's radiation, isolation and confinement, distance from Earth, altered gravity, and then hostile and closed environments.  So, this was sort of a prelude because coming up soon we're going to actually have episodes that dive deep into these five hazards.  Each of them.  One episode per hazard.  We haven't recorded them, so if you have any questions, please send them in.  Use the hashtag askNASA.  And just the make the note that it's for \"Houston, We Have a Podcast,\" and we'll actually put them into those episodes.  And answer the questions associated with each of those five hazards.  You can also listen to other episodes of \"Houston, We Have a Podcast.\"  We call them episodes just for our sake, but really you don't really have to listen to them in any particular order.  Otherwise, you can check out our NASA podcast, \"Gravity Assist\" and NASA in the Silicon Valley.  You can go to NASA.gov/iss.   That's the International Space Station website to find out what's going on on the International Space Station that helps us to identify these five hazards.  Otherwise you can go to NASA.gov/HRP, and that's the Human Research Program site.  On social media, International Space Station is on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.  Again, use the hashtag NASA.  Really, send in your questions.  And we're going to put them in these episodes.  So, this podcast was recorded on May 7th and May 23rd, 2018.  Thanks to Alex Perryman, Pat Ryan, Lori Abidee [assumed spelling], Brandy Dean, Bill Stafford and Mel Whiting.  Thanks again to Dr. Mike Barratt for coming on the show.  We'll be back next week."

                        "description": "Gary Jordan (Host): Houston, We Have a Podcast. Welcome to the official podcast of the NASA Johnson Space Center. Episode 101, \"Lesser Known Stories of Apollo 11.\" I'm Gary Jordan and I'll be your host today. If you're familiar with us, this is where we bringing scientists, engineers, astronauts, historians, all to let you know the coolest stuff about what's going on right here at NASA. And sometimes we take a moment to reflect on what we've done in the past. Chances are you, at the very least, know the highlights of Apollo 11--  Neil Armstrong: Houston, Tranquility Base here. The eagle has landed.  Charlie Duke: Roger Tranquility, we copy you on the ground. You got a bunch of guys about to turn blue. We're breathing again. Thanks a lot.  Walter Cronkite Armstrong is on the moon. Neil Armstrong, 38 year old American, standing on the surface of the moon on this July 20th, 1969.  Neil Armstrong: It's one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind.  Host: It was a harrowing journey to get there but NASA persevered and got the job done by the end of the decade. They did it-- Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin-- took the first steps on the lunar surface. You can probably look anywhere-- books, documentaries, movies, articles-- and really dive deep into that mission normally told by recognizable figures-- Armstrong and Aldrin, Mike Collins, Gene Kranz. What you might not have heard are the stories of people working on the space shuttle before the moon landing even happened, monitoring the lunar space walk from the back rooms of Mission Control. And the recovery operations after landing. The arrival of the moon rocks at the Johnson Space Center. Stories of the many others who were helping to make this mission successful but that you may not have heard before. To recount stories behind the scenes of that historic mission we're bringing in some very special guests. Returning to the podcast once again is Dr. Jennifer Ross-Nazzal, our historian here at the Johnson Space Center. She's worked on oral history projects here interviewing many people to capture the lesser known stories, so she's coming on the podcast today to talk about some of these great adventures. We also shot a video a few months ago at Rice Stadium. We had such a great turnout for this video and it turned out to be partially a reunion for the nearly 50 Apollo alumni that excitedly agreed to participate. And while we were there, we tag teamed with Rice University to film as many Apollo alumni as we could in a short amount of time for them to tell their stories and we'll share those here today. So starting with Jennifer Ross-Nazzal, here are some of the lesser known stories of Apollo 11 told 50 years after the historic landing on the moon. Enjoy.  [ Music ]  Host: Jennifer Ross-Nazzal, thank you so much for coming on the podcast. Once again, you are among the elite here coming on three times so I really appreciate all of the time you've dedicated to us.  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: Oh well thank you so much for inviting me. It's an honor.  Host: And it's been 50 years now since the landing of Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin on the moon. And of all the topics, you know we've thought about this for a while, what do we really want to explore to celebrate the Apollo 50th because NASA is doing a lot all across the agency, so what can we do here on the podcast? And I thought this was such a unique topic to explore. The lesser known stories of Apollo 11. Things that-- you might hear the recognizable story, one small step for man-- you know you might hear that a lot of times but I think this is a great medium to explore some of the other ones. So Jennifer, you've put together really a fantastic list of stories that go from even before the moon landing, through the moon landing, 'til after the-- I think we're going to end with one of, I think my favorites, after going over this so I'm really looking forward to it. I think I want to kick off though, let's talk about, you know, what do we have in store actually before we even go into that? What do we even have in store for us today?  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: Well, as you mentioned I tried to pull together some of the unknown stories of Apollo 11. We all know the Gene Kranz story, the lunar landing mission and his talk before the MOCR crew, and you know he's with them 100% whether we land or we don't, I'm with you. And we know a lot of what was going on with the crew. We don't know a lot of the stories though about the people behind the scenes and so I tried to pull together some of those stories. And also, like you mentioned, pull together a story pre-mission and then some of the things that were going on during the mission that aren't, weren't as notable but today I think are quite interesting. They're sort of human stories that I think people will engage with. And then the post flight, what was going on like in the LRL and the mobile quarantine facility.  Host: That's awesome. Yeah so some of these names you're going to be hearing today are names you may have never heard before. I do think though you do have one name that I'm pretty familiar with, Michael Collins.  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: Yes. [laughs]  Host: [Laughs] Of course he was the one, Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin, we always say those names right up front because they were the ones that had the boots on the moon, but someone had to be in the command module up orbiting the moon. And guess who that was? It was Michael Collins.  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: Yes.  Host: So what did-- let's see, he might have a little lesser known story I suppose.  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: You know he does, and it's something, I was flipping through \"Carrying the Fire\" which is his autobiography, and I was just looking for stories and I came across a poem that his wife wrote to him before his mission. He actually took the day off before the flight which we always think the astronauts are working madly up until their mission and once they climb into the cabin they're kind of done but he decided to take the day off and he called his wife-- his wife was not there-- and had a chat with her and kept rereading her note to him and the poem that was attached to it. So I thought maybe your readers would like to hear this poem that she wrote to him.  Host: Oh that is wonderful, yes. Let's go through that poem.  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: Okay. So this is called \"To a Husband Who Must Seek the Stars.\"   In your eyes, the first glad token  As when first our love we proved,  So your mind to mine has spoken  Just as if you're lips had moved.   You are saying -- yes I know --  That the lure of space beguiles.  You are pleading, “Let me go,”  Not unwilling but with smiles.   Can you love me, and still choose  Whispers that I cannot hear?  Late to love, how can I bear to lose? Content for some inconstant sphere?   Tell me how you see my role- To stay, to wait, yet yearn to go.  Where is the comfort for my soul?  You, my love, have helped me know.   I'll be unafraid, undaunted.  Yes of course! I need not face Any peril; or be haunted By the hazards you embrace.   I could've sought by wit or wile  Your bright dream to dim. And yet  If I'd swayed you with a smile My reward would be regret.   So, for once, you shall not hear  Of the tears unbidden, welling;  Or the nighttime stabs of fear.  These, this time, are not for telling.   Take my silence though intended;  Fill it with the joy you feel.  Take my courage, now pretended-- You my love will make it real.   And he wrote in his book, I hope I will.  Host: Wow. So that was, I guess it was her way of saying you know you need to do this mission, don't worry about me. You know I'm not going to stop you. This is kind of your destiny almost.  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: Yeah and to me it's, she's also telling him while she might be scared she's not going to share those feelings with him.  Host: Yes.  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: She wants him to have this opportunity. She doesn't want him to have any regrets or herself to have any regrets.  Host: But she was open with that emotion to him even-- because you said this was even before his mission.  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: It was.  Host: She said know that I am scared but it's not going to stop you, it's not going to stop me from stopping you. And even if I did, I would regret it.  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: Yeah. Yeah.  Host: Wow. What a beautiful way to say that. And you said that Michael Collins was on the phone with her reading back her poem to him on the phone?  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: Well no I think he was rereading it in crew quarters.  Host: He was rereading it in crew quarters?  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: Yeah and--  Host: I see.  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: You know he mentioned how clearly she had been thinking about this for some time. It wasn't just a note, you know, kind of I love you, good luck on the mission. Clearly she had thought about this for some time and been working on it.  Host: Wow.  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: Yeah.  Host: What all did Michael Collins do on his day off before his mission, do you know?  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: You know, what else he did, I don't know. [laughs] He just mentioned that which I thought was interesting.  Host: He just-- yeah. That was probably one of the more significant things. If you're going to remember anything, that's a beautiful thing to remember.  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: Yes.  Host: All right Jennifer, I'm really excited to go into these stories. To sort of kick things off though these stories are from something that your office does and the Oral History Project. Tell me a little bit about that.  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: Yeah so we have a major oral history project at our center. We're sort of the lead center for oral histories across the agency. And our project was established by Center Director George Abbey in 1996. And if you're interested in more of the history you can actually go out and read an interview with Duane Ross who sort of helped kick off the project. But I'll give you a little bit of history. Mr. Abbey was a big fan of Stephen Ambrose. He wrote a number of books that were quite popular in the 90's like \"D-Day\". He wrote about Lewis and Clark and some other folks. And so he was a big fan of his efforts at interviewing these veterans and he realized that we were losing a lot of folks here at JSC who took part in the Apollo Program, Mercury, Gemini, and he wanted to capture those experiences. He wanted to capture the procedures and processes but also the events and the career experiences of some of these individuals or lessons learned. And so that project kicked off in 1997. The first interview was with Jack Kinzler who we'll be talking a little bit about today as well, and you know he was well known at the center for being a Mr. Fix It and saving Skylab, and but he was our first in the summer of 1997. Since then we have interviewed 982 people.  Host: Wow.  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: We have over 2,000 recorded hours of oral history. We've done over 1,200 sessions and we have over 1,000 transcripts online.  Host: Whew! It's got to be difficult to remember all those stories. That's why you've got to capture them, right? [Laughs]  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: Yes, exactly. And everybody's got a story.  Host: Yeah, and they span-- this is not just Apollo history right? They span through the-- is it the agency's history? Is it Johnson Space Center's history?  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: Well we actually do a lot of different oral history projects. So interesting that you mention that. We do our JSC Oral History project and it does span from the Space Task Group days through International Space Station, Orion. We've tried to capture all of that history and everything in between. But we do do oral histories for NASA headquarters. So we do interviews with administrators or center directors, people that our headquarters history office wants us to talk to. And then we've done different projects over the years that we've received funding for. Like for instance when the shuttle was retiring we did a big project to capture the history of the space shuttle from development through retirement which was a huge effort. Can you imagine, you know, 40 years of history--  Host: Right.  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: in oral histories?  Host: Yeah.  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: Yeah.  Host: 30 years of shuttle but you're talking about development stage right?  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: Yes.  Host: Yeah and there's a lot of years there.  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: Yeah there's a lot going on. So we've got that. We've captured some history of aviatrix. Let's see, we've captured a lot of women's history with the Herstory's project. So there's quite a bit out there if people want to go out to the JSC history portal and look at the oral histories, there's just so much material out there. It's such a wealth of material from these people that we've interviewed.  Host: Very exciting. And today we're going to be focusing on mainly the time around Apollo. And I think when we were going through these stories together, I think you kicked it off in such a nice way because the first thing we're actually going to talk about is the space shuttle which a lot of people don't even recognize was a thing around the time of Apollo 11. So this one was with Jerry Ross and Kathy Sullivan.  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: Yeah so Jerry Ross, he's very well known for the number of space flights that he flew on. He's actually the record holder of seven space flights along with Franklin Chang-Diaz. And Kathy Sullivan was one of the first six women astronauts selected 1978 and she's the first American woman to do a space walk. So, you know, very well known folks. I picked these stories because I just thought they were interesting. I thought it was important to highlight the fact that there were people who were going to be working in the program later in life who were witnessing and remembered these and shared these memories with us. So Jerry Ross, he remembers, he was in college at that point. Since fourth grade he wanted to be an engineer and go to Purdue. And so this was summer break and he was working for U.S. Steel. And he remembers just sitting on his couch with his fiancée on his lap just waiting for that first spacewalk to happen on the moon, and being very excited about it. He also remembers his younger sister taking snapshots of the television. And you know it was pretty grainy, kind of hard to see, and he kept telling her you know those shots aren't going to turn out but they ended up turning out. But he was just, you know, mesmerized, he said by the whole mission itself. His fiancée found him just sort of sitting there watching, you know, endless footage of Mission Control and what was happening. And then Kathy Sullivan I think is sort of interesting because she really didn't intend initially to study science or, you know, work for NASA. She wasn't going to be an engineer. She had an interest in language and so she was actually going to study languages in college. But she remembers she was 17 at the time sitting in her family den-- you know I can kind of see her sitting on the floor the way most kids do watching TV-- and she remembers she wasn't really a spectator for this event, she was almost like a part of it she said. It just sort of drew her in and she remembers hearing Buzz Aldrin, although she admits she wasn't sure who it was at the time because she really wasn't following that closely, say contact light. And she said you know there was just this sort of spark in her mind like oh, she made a connection as to what was happening here. They had something that she called curb feelers on the lunar module so they could tell where they were on the moon. And she said it just sort of made an imprint on her that, you know, she kind of figured out some of the engineering going on there with the Apollo Program.  Host: Wow, it sounds like such a subtle thing but even these shuttle astronauts were inspired by some of the early parts of NASA history. Actually we're going through right now and interviewing some of our leaders here at the Johnson Space Center talking about, you know, how were you inspired to come here and did Apollo 11 have a significant impact, and all of them-- not all of them but a lot of them-- remember very vividly what they were doing. And a lot of them, you know, they were, a lot of them were kids so they went out and they got like some kind of moon thing that was at the grocery store or the convenience store but it was just fascinating what-- you know how much this inspired people. Now speaking of space shuttle and this is kind of what I think I alluded to in the-- before you even started with the Jerry Ross and Kathy Sullivan story, but space shuttle was a thing even before Apollo 11 landed.  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: Yes. Yeah. So I was going through some of our stories and I wanted to make sure we included some women because during the Apollo Program there weren't a lot of women working or at least most of the women were secretaries and admins and we haven't had a chance to talk with them but we've interviewed Ivy Hooks and Dottie Lee and they were some engineers working in the engineering directorate. And Ivy Hooks likes to tell the story how on April 1st-- April Fool's Day 1969-- so we haven't landed on the moon yet, she gets a phone call from Max Faget's secretary and tells her to report to building 36, they're going to have a meeting there and they all thought it was kind of an April Fool's Day joke. And so they show up there and she's like what's going on? You know it's the third floor. There's a lot of furniture in this space. This space hasn't been used. It's kind of dirty, I'm wearing white. Max Faget walks in and Dottie Lee also remembers this-- she was an actual engineer trained by Max Faget-- she originally started out as a human computer out at NACA in Langley. And they both remember him pulling out of this garment bag a space shuttle, a balsa wood plane, and throwing it across the room and saying we're going to build America's next spacecraft. It's going to launch like a rocket and land like a plane. And so these two women-- they were the only two women other than the secretary-- were in this space, they were locked up. They couldn't actually tell anybody where they were or what they were working on or what they were doing, and they were helping to design the first reusable spacecraft, the space shuttle. And there weren't any windows. You know it was kind of a big deal for Ivy. [laughs] But what I find interesting about this is we're working on the next spacecraft while we're still working to land a man on the moon. And interestingly enough, Dottie Lee remembers that because she was in that room and had told herself, she had promised herself when we got back from Apollo 11 she was just going to celebrate. She was going to, you know, party like everyone else. Everyone else was so excited and she remembers she worked late that night.  Host: Oh.  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: And she was in her car. And her husband also worked out here, John Lee, he was also an engineer. And she was driving home on NASA Road 1. She lived in Dickinson and she remembers seeing cars everywhere. Everyone's at the bars. Everyone's celebrating and she couldn't. She had to drive home and relieve her babysitter so it was kind of, you know, a sad moment I think for her because she had helped accomplish this goal but she had other important things to do. She had two daughters at home--  Host: Yeah.  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: and but she said you know it was exciting for her though because she felt like she was contributing to tomorrow today by working on the space shuttle.  Host: That's right. And it made a significant impact. We already said, you know, like there's 30 years of the shuttle flying and even before that development stage starting in April when Max Faget pulled out a small space shuttle and said this is what we're going to do now.  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: Um hum. Absolutely.  Host: Who was Max Faget by the way?  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: Max Faget was our spacecraft designer here at the Johnson Space Center and so he helped design the Mercury, Gemini, and Apollo capsule. So he's very well respected.  Host: A good salesman too if he's doing this--  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: Yeah.  Host: to get everyone to start working. That's great. [laughs]  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: Yeah. Yeah. And I should add that Dottie Lee actually is known for helping design the nose of the space shuttle. It's called Dottie's nose.  Host: Really?  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: Yes.  Host: Okay. The space shuttle, I guess, well was it the space shuttle as we know it or was it--  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: Yes.  Host: Really?  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: Yeah.  Host: Wow, that's a big deal.  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: It is a big deal, yeah.  Host: Very busy people I'm sure all across. I know everyone was working real hard on this and that includes, you know, you said Ivy Hooks, she wanted to celebrate and was working late but she also was a mom and that was part of it, relieving the kids.  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: Yeah. Yeah Dottie. Dottie was.  Host: Yeah. Oh Dottie, it was Dottie that did it. Oh I'm sorry.  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: Yeah that's okay. Yeah Ivy doesn't have any children that I'm aware of. [laughs] Don't worry about it.  Host: I messed that up, sorry.  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: That's okay.  Host: You know now we're getting into, you know, the actual moon landing. I like this story from Bob Carlton with the stopwatch. That is a great story.  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: Yeah. Yeah so Bob Carlton was LEM control. He's working in the mission operations control room and he's on the white team which is Gene Kranz's team. So some people might know this story but I think it's just a great human story because I think they probably know about the challenges that the flight controllers were facing in the room but there's another aspect to it that I'll talk about. So before the mission happened he was, you know they would simulate these missions, they would make sure that everything was running properly, and in his oral history he talks about the fact that they had plenty of margins in the lunar module tanks when they were going to be coming down. They were going to have plenty of fuel to land on the moon. They would have plenty of fuel left. But when they were landing Apollo 11 something happened. Neil Armstrong as he's landing the lunar module sees a huge crater where they're supposed to land and there's boulders. And so suddenly that margin that they had really starts to go down pretty quickly. And so they're watching things. He's watching it. And they weren't supposed to trip something that they called low level inside of the lunar module. They had two ways of telling how much fuel they had. They had something like a gas gauge that would tell them, you know, full, empty, and somewhere in between. And then they also had this low level sensor. And once you hit that you only had so many seconds left of fuel. Well they ended up tripping that and so Bob Carlton pulled out a stopwatch and he talks about in his oral history how he put something very technical-- he put a couple pieces of scotch tape on his stopwatch--  Host: [Laughs] Yes, very technical.  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: [Laugh] Yeah, very technical. So he clicked it and he said okay when it gets to 60 seconds it'll be here and when it gets to 30 seconds it'll be here and we'll only have just a little bit of time left. The other challenge that he was facing was that you couldn't go to the moon and leave the tank empty. They had to be able to call an abort and have some fuel left. And so he said he was just watching it so intently, you know? Every-- once they got down to that low level like people were just sweating in the MOCR and it was just so quiet. And so they got to 60 seconds. And he's starting to doubt whether or not they're going to be able to land. And then they get to 30 seconds and he said finally they landed and he clicked the stopwatch. 18 seconds left of fuel.  Host: Wow.  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: And so you know we often remember Charlie Duke telling the astronauts, you know, whew you got a bunch--  Host: You've got a bunch of guys about to turn blue, yeah.  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: Yes and you know Bob Carlton really was that guy because he knew that at some point they probably were going to have to call an abort and he wasn't really sure they were going to be able to land at this point. So what's interesting though about the story, the sort of human aspect that I think is interesting is that he sees the stopwatch and he thinks what a great memento, what a great artifact of this mission. And so he takes it back to his office and he puts it in his desk because he wants to remember this moment. And you know he pulls it out occasionally but then he realizes well, you know, I probably shouldn't keep it at work because a janitor or somebody might come in my desk and just take it.  Host: Right.  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: So I'm going to take it home. So he puts it in a handkerchief and he carries it home and he puts it in a desk at home and occasionally he pulls it out. Well he pulls it out one time and he looks at it and he said, I must be losing my mind here because it should be at 18 seconds, it's at like 22 seconds, but he doesn't think anything of it he just puts it away. You know how all of us do that, we might have a trophy or a picture we'll look at it and put it away. And so he pulls it out again and it's on a different time this time. So he approaches one of his daughters who was a twirler and you know he asked her what's going on? Well it turns out she was using the stopwatch for her routines to time them and he was like oh okay that explains it. Well eventually he decided, you know, this was a great artifact, it needed to be somewhere else not in his house. So he donated it to the Smithsonian but he ended up winding the stopwatch back to 18 seconds--  Host: Oh.  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: So, you know, it would look like it did when they landed on the moon.  Host: Right. Right. That's where it ended up but--  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: Right.  Host: but little do people know this was used for twirling exercises.  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: Right. Exactly. Yes. [laughs] I just think that's a great story because I think so many people can relate to that, especially with kids. You know you tell your kid don't touch this, and what does your kid want to do immediately? Touch it or--  Host: That's the only thing I want to touch now.  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: Exactly. Yes.  Host: Wonderful. Yeah you have-- that's a big story. You have a bunch of guys about to turn blue here because everyone was waiting. They had to-- they couldn't land in the area they were supposed to land, they had to find a new place to land which is why they were using all of these, all of this fuel. But it wasn't just those people in the primary Mission Control. You know a lot of people don't realize there are other rooms looking at other things. Even after they landed there's a room called the Mission Evaluation Room.  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: Right.  Host: Right? And there's, I like the story of Tom Sanzone monitoring the EVA. We actually got to interview him not too long ago at Rice Stadium. It was actually a weird coincidence that you have his--  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: Oh great.  Host: his name here. We have this great video where we have all these different Apollo alumni, current employees, astronauts, former astronauts and we gathered to celebrate the 50th anniversary but also remember John F. Kennedy's speech in '62 there on the field. And it just turned out to be this great thing. We pulled a couple people aside. Tom Sanzone just happened to be one of them. He has a great story because he was one of the portable life support system engineers right?  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: Right, yeah.  Host: Yeah. So what was he doing in the MER?  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: Yeah so interestingly enough he was out in Pasadena originally because he was told to go home and get some rest because of course they were going to be monitoring the backpacks while they were doing an EVA on the moon. So he remembers being home, you know, sort of waiting. You know everyone was anticipating this moonwalk and the landing so he watches it at home on his television but then he's called and told to report for duty because they decided instead of a rest period the astronauts actually want to go out for a spacewalk. So, you know, he comes in and he said there were probably about eight people in the Mission Evaluation Room from Hamilton Standard which is who he works for who was in charge of that system. And you know it's kind of interesting, like I said, it's the support room for Mission Control but they're monitoring the backpacks for the astronauts. So he's monitoring Armstrong and there's another guy who's monitoring Armstrong's data as well and then they have two other engineers who are monitoring Buzz's backpack. And, you know, that backpack is really their whole life support system. Everything that we take for granted on Earth, that's what that backpack system provides. And so they're monitoring lots of different things like the amps, the batteries, the oxygen levels, the pressure of the suit, lots of different things. They actually got their data on cathode ray tubes so things would come out on TVs and they would graph that data using magic markers, by hand you know? Things that we're used to computers doing nowadays but they would do that by hand. They also had these displays with stopwatches because they wanted to make sure of course the astronauts are on the moon, the last thing you want is oh my gosh you know we have like 20 seconds left of oxygen, get in the LEM, you know?  Host: Yeah. Yeah.  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: You want to make sure there's ample oxygen and everything's going fine. So you're monitoring all of these things, all of these things with inside this space suit itself. And you know they are so focused on the task at hand, kind of like Bob Carlton was on that stopwatch, that Tom Sanzone doesn't even remember seeing Neil Armstrong or Buzz Aldrin walk on the moon. He doesn't remember that at all and he's not even sure there was a TV in the room but they were just so focused.  Host: They were looking at the data.  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: Mm-hmm.  Host: They were-- yeah they didn't have time to look at the TV, they were looking at that stopwatch. Oh man they're going out.  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: Yes.  Host: Yeah I remember talking to Tom Sanzone and the-- I think the funniest thing I learned from that is I did not realize that once the astronauts landed, the next thing was a rest period, for them to take a nap.  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: Yes.  Host: And I remember Tom Sanzone when he was recalling this just laughing because he's like can you imagine, you landed on the moon and you're like hold on let me just take a quick nap.  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: Right.  Host: Of course they were excited. They wanted to go right out. So, yeah of course they weren't going to waste any time and oh let me just rest up a bit. They only had a couple hours really.  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: Yeah. Yeah it was about two and a half hours.  Host: Yeah.  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: To be out on the moon.  Host: Right so obviously yes you have to take care of that period you know I'll sleep later.  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: Yes. Well and you just imagine the excitement. You're kind of like a little kid. I mean this is a new playground for you to go out and see a new world.  Host: Yes.  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: And experience all of that.  Host: And you know what's great is they got to feel that way, Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin on the moon, yeah I'm excited, let's go out. But they had people like Tom Sanzone in the back room that was busy looking at a stopwatch and you know couldn't, yes maybe he was excited but didn't have time to go check out a TV because he had a job to do and it was, you know, folks like him that actually made that possible. So I love these small stories of people in the background. It's amazing.  Real quick while we're talking about Tom Sanzone, we actually got to interview him at Rice Stadium while we were there so here's his version of the story. [ Transition Sound ]  Host: Tom Sanzone, and what was your job during the Apollo program?  Tom Sanzone: I was a portable life support system engineer. That's the backpack that they wore on the moon so I worked for Hamilton Standard was the name of the company then. It's a United Technologies Company. So we did all the testing, modifications, maintenance, flight prep, astronaut training in vacuum chambers and things like that. So I was involved with most of that stuff.  Host: Okay. Do you have highlights from your time working in portable life support systems, something, some story that comes to mind?  Tom Sanzone: Yeah I smile because I've been asked this before and what I tell people is when I was 22 years old 10 months out of Villanova I got to train Neil Armstrong and the Apollo 11 crew on how to use that life support system and my career has been downhill ever since. [laughs]  Host: Do you remember where you were during the Apollo 11 moon landing?  Tom Sanzone: Yeah. For the landing I was actually in my apartment in Pasadena primarily because the crew was supposed to sleep after they landed on the moon and then go out for their walk on the moon after they woke up. So we were going to monitor the performance and so they didn't want us hanging around and, you know, being tired so none of us really believed that they were going to sleep [laughs] you know so it wasn't a surprise. So I watched by myself in my apartment in Pasadena when they actually landed and then shortly thereafter I got a phone call saying you know they're not going to sleep, they're going to go out. I-- can you imagine sleeping on the moon when you just landed? [laughs] And so then I, you know I drove in and I worked in what's called a Mission Evaluation Room, you know, one of the back rooms of Mission Control.  [ Transition Sound ]  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: Yeah I don't think people realize how many people were working in the background.  Host: Yeah.  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: Just making sure everything was operating smoothly, you know? The astronauts get sort of all the credit and the attention but there were so many people that contributed to the Apollo Program in so many different ways.  Host: And this next story is a perfect example of that because this is the story of a guy who honestly didn't even appreciate the landing on the moon until much later. I love this story.  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: Yeah so Ed Fendell, he did an interview with our project years ago and he is on console also with Gene Kranz's team. He's the ENCO console. And he remembers as the landing is happening, he's kind of levitating in his chair. And he knows that he wasn't really levitating, but that's kind of, it was just so surreal. He didn't really think they were going to land on the moon the first time. He thought that maybe they would try but it wouldn't happen. But it's just so surreal he feels like he was levitating and you know they do the change of shift and he goes home. He decides to, you know, go back to his apartment, get some rest, cleans up, and decides to grab some breakfast before he heads in for work the next day. And he goes by what's called a Dutch Kettle. It's like a coffee shop and nearby his apartment and he decides to go sit at the counter. He's got a newspaper with him and he orders breakfast. Said he ordered scrambled eggs. I'm sure he got some other stuff but he was sitting there and some guys walked in from a gas station down the street and, you know, you could tell because they were in their overalls and you know they're kind of greasy, but they were talking about the Apollo 11 mission and talking about how they had been through World War II, they were at Normandy and D Day, they walked through Paris and made it to Berlin, and one of the guys said but yesterday was the proudest I've been to be an American. And Ed Fendell was sitting there and he heard that and it suddenly hit him what they had done. And he picked up his newspaper and left the restaurant and he started to cry and he just kind of lost it because until that point, you know he knew we landed on the moon but I don't think it hit him, you know like it had hit so many other Americans across the globe who were just excited. Like Dottie Lee mentioned, so many people were at the bars celebrating. People were in Times Square. But it hadn't hit this person who was in the MOCR who was so focused on getting the task done until this moment, what they had really achieved and what it meant to the citizens of this country. And he said he still has this paper til this day. You know he cried in his car and decided to come into work and but that's just such a great moment. I mean it really speaks to what was happening with some of these guys in the MOCR. It was a great achievement but it didn't really hit home initially--  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: Yeah.  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: what had happened.   Host: It-- certainly that story gives me an appreciation for how focused these guys were. You know like it's not just, they're not just the front row seat for this whole thing. It's way beyond that. It's these guys that had their head buried in all of the data to make sure that the mission was going to be successful really just working hard to get the mission done and not truly realizing or appreciating the world around them and everything that was happening because you have guys looking at stopwatches, you have guys monitoring data, you have guys just making sure that after you know 18 seconds left of fuel that everything's going to run smoothly and we're going to get these guys home. You know it's not just we landed on the moon. The mission's not over at that point.  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: Right.  Host: And it's something that I think, you know even these human interest stories, these, and not even human interest but just these very human stories really, you know, help you to appreciate that.  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: Very much. And I should add, you know, a lot of people that we've talked to over the years who were part of the Apollo Program talk about how they were so singularly focused they didn't really know what was going on with Vietnam or Civil Rights. All of these things that were erupting around the U.S. and the story that I always like to tell people is Al Bean who was the lunar module pilot on Apollo 12 said he didn't really learn about all these things until much later thanks to the Discovery Channel. And this is before he came to NASA but he said he didn't even know who Rosa Parks was. You know Rosa Parks, that was in like the 50's.  Host: Sure.  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: But I mean that's a good example of just how involved they were in Apollo. Their noses were very deep into these subjects and they weren't watching the news, they weren't reading the papers, they were singularly focused on achieving the goal of landing a man on the moon.  Host: Yeah. Of course there was a lot going on in '69 you know? This was definitely even to some of these guys were some of the most, one of the proudest American achievements landing on the moon but you did have Vietnam going on. I know a popular, was it a book or a movie, \"The Andromeda Strain\"?  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: Yeah \"The Andromeda Strain\", the book.  Host: It was a book, yeah.  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: Yeah by Michael Crichton, yeah.  Host: Yeah. So this next story about, is it John Hirasaki?  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: John Hirasaki, yeah.  Host: John Hirasaki, \"The Andromeda Strain\". That's, that was interesting because that was the, almost, I don't know, \"The Andromeda Strain\" is I guess about this virus that comes to Earth or something, right?  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: Yes.  Host: Yeah.  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: Yeah I remember reading it-- I haven't read it in a while but I remember reading it in college and thinking oh this is crazy, you know, that you would have to-- I think it was sort of based on this idea of a Lunar Receiving Lab and sort of going in and having to like burn your skin off when you would want to come out because of this bug that came to Earth and just this sort of scary environment.  Host: Yeah but it really helps you to put into perspective like that was a thing. People were very, you know, the moon, we were landing on the moon but part of the mission was getting all this stuff back and people had no idea what to expect. What is on the moon? So they were handling these things with such care because we don't know. We can get a virus and bring it back, who knows?  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: Right. Yeah, yeah. There was a big concern. A lot of people who worked at NASA weren't as concerned because they thought the moon was a sterile environment.  Host: Sure.  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: So initially when we were planning for the moon landing there wasn't this idea of a Lunar Receiving Lab. That came a little bit later. You know we were really focused on engineering. But then scientists themselves who weren't working at NASA became concerned that we were going to be bringing back people and rocks and soil from the moon and, you know, what impact would that have on plants? What impact would that have on humanity and animals? Could that have a detrimental impact? And maybe we need a quarantine facility. So that started the whole discussion about whether or not the crew needed to be quarantined and for how long and the safety of the planet and all of these concerns.  Host: Yeah we've had a couple podcast episodes so far with some of the folks in the lunar lab and other folks who study meteorites and I think one of the best things from the Apollo 11 mission was when Neil Armstrong, you know they had these containers that they were supposed to put all the rocks in, but after they put the rocks there was a lot of empty space. So what does Neil Armstrong do? He starts-- he gets out the shovel and starts putting in some of the soil--  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: Right.  Host: from on top just to fill some of this empty space. You know, why not? So they're on the moon and a lot of the folks say that that was some of the best stuff that they brought back with them. Not the rocks but the soil themselves. It revealed a lot about the moon and about Earth's history.  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: Yeah.  Host: Very cool story. So what's the story on Hirasaki?  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: Yeah I'm going to sort of intertwine that with Randy Stone--  Host: Oh yeah.  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: because they both worked for the landing and recovery division. They're both young guys who came in and they're both actually on the ship, the USS Hornet, which is the ship that's going to pick up the crew coming back from the moon for the first time. And so they both work for the landing and recovery division. They're both engineers. Randy Stone is the lead engineer for the folks outside of the mobile quarantine facility. And John Hirasaki is actually going to be quarantined with the crew that's coming back inside the mobile quarantine facility. And so I want to just talk a little bit about Randy Stone first because I think it kind of gives an idea of what's happening and then we can talk about John. We'll probably go back and forth between the two.  Host: Sure.  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: But he was on the ship for a while. You know they were practicing things. They knew that President Nixon was going to be coming on board and so they were practicing maneuvers and routines and trying to get things ready for when the crew was coming and for when the president was coming. When the president comes, he actually models the biologic isolation garment for the president which I wish I'd seen a picture of it. I haven't been able to find a photo of it. But I, you know I think that's kind of interesting that he would be working on these things. And John Hirasaki is placed on board but he's placed inside of the mobile quarantine facility. They actually drew straws. There were four guys who were interested in being in that mobile quarantine facility. Even though, you know, there were fears about maybe bringing back a lunar bug and you know nobody knew what they might be bringing back and what impact that might have. He was actually a newlywed. He had married someone about six months earlier and so of course \"The Andromeda Strain\" is on her mind. But you know people wanted to make a contribution. People were willing to say, you know, hey I'll participate. I would like to do that task. And so he got the short straw and was in the mobile quarantine facility. He was put in early because there were concerns that, you know, he might catch something from some of the crew on the Hornet and they didn't want him to have any sort of cold or virus and give that to the crew themselves. And there was another person who was in the mobile quarantine facility and that was Dr. Carpentier, their physician at that time. So like you said, you know there were some concerns that they had but he's, you know he's got a front row seat. When the crew comes back he's got a front row seat to hearing the stories that the crew would tell about landing on the moon for the first time which is really exciting of course because when you go somewhere exciting and interesting you want to come back you want to tell people all about it. And they're locked in this quarantine facility because people are concerned, hey maybe you brought back a lunar bug. Maybe you're going to infect humanity as we know it. So they've got a chance to actually sit and talk with the crew and they tell their stories. So here, we need to go back now to Randy Stone because John Hirasaki is in the mobile quarantine facility. They bring back the crew, they go into the mobile quarantine facility but they also need to bring back the command module. And inside the command module are things like the rocks, as you talked about. There are also photos that they need to get back here to Houston to process. And Hirasaki, that's going to be one of his tasks. Well, Randy Stone is in charge of sort of safing the command module and, you know, there's a lot of toxins on board and so they need to make sure that the reaction control system jets are safed. And they also need to attach the command module to the mobile quarantine facility which is a trailer essentially that they're living in. And so they sort of snap it on but then he talks about how they've got hundreds of rolls of yellow tape. He said they used to joke that they couldn't go to the moon without yellow tape. He said it's like duct tape is today. You know--  Host: Oh.  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: you just use it for everything. And so, you know, they had to seal up the command module with all this yellow tape so there would be a good seal. Even though it snapped on they wanted to make sure nothing made its way out. You know they were very concerned about that trying to protect, like I said, humanity and animals and plant life here all across the globe. Not just Americans themselves. And so once they had done that, John Hirosaki was able to go into the command module and do some of the things that he needed to do. One of the first things that he mentioned that he had to do was take photographs of the command module, the interior. This is what it looked like before anybody touched it. You know this is where the switches were. This is how things, where things were located. And so he did that and then he reaches in and he grabs the rock boxes which you mentioned, and he also grabs the magazines, the photos that the crew had taken because here in Houston they want both of those things. And then there's also a beta cloth bag of luner rocks that they're going to take with them back in the mobile quarantine facility. Interestingly enough though, he has to take those boxes and he has to vacuum seal them before he can give them to Randy Stone because Randy Stone is going to take those boxes and put them on a carrier. But they need to be decontaminated because of course they're in the command module so he vacuum seals them and then puts them in a decontamination lock which Randy Stone describes it as using a, you know, a really toxic Clorox solution because they have to be rinsed and washed. And he said that, you know, it would hurt your hands. It would stain your clothes. It smelled horrible. But you wanted to make sure of course you killed everything. So he said, you know, his most memorable moment though was getting that box-- those boxes which were made here by our tech services people-- and taking them with the Marine guard. He said he thought it was rather funny, he's on a Naval carrier but he's got Marine guards with him taking it to the plane as if anybody's going to jump on him and grab these lunar rocks. And he said that was probably his proudest moment. But then John Hirosaki remains in that mobile quarantine facility. And interesting enough, he's sort of the chef and bottle washer is what he likes to call himself. Of course they had to eat and they had something new in that mobile quarantine facility, a microwave. They had an Amana Radarange which a lot of households-- nowadays everybody has a microwave but at that point a lot of households didn't. And so he was actually in charge of picking out the kind of meals that they would have in the mobile quarantine facility when they were doing tests. People wanted them to have like fancy meals like Lobster Thermidor and other things--  Host: Wow.  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: and he was like nah, I think we need something else.  Host: Yeah.  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: Maybe just like meat and potatoes kind of thing.  Host: Yeah.  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: So, you know, he spent a lot of time, you know, preparing meals and doing those sort of things. And obviously just chatting with the crew, learning more about the mission itself. And then once they got to the Lunar Receiving Lab here in Houston he helped do some work here and obviously he was in quarantine with the rest of the crew.  Host: Wow. So that must've been quite a long time then that he was in quarantine.  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: Yeah they were in quarantine for a total of 21 days but that started from the minute that they left the lunar surface, a total of 21 days. So--  Host: Got it. Okay. Wow.  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: Yeah they wanted to be sure that, you know, they didn't have any lunar bugs that they brought back just in case.  Host: I know. Yeah you go through all these different measures to make sure you're not touching anything too much which I think blends in nicely with the next story.  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: Yeah so Terry Slezak is a photographer who is in the Lunar Receiving Lab when the crew gets back. But before the crew actually left, he had been for a time trying to figure out how they were going to safe the film, you know make sure that they could process that film, make sure it wasn't contaminated with lunar bugs. And so he'd been doing a lot of simulations in the Lunar Receiving Lab which is an awfully complicated process which I probably won't go into because I'll probably slaughter it. But you know they were trying different ways of making sure they could safely process the film but not release anything out into the public that wasn't safe. And so, you know, they tried different ways of protecting the film. They put like nylon in between the film itself. Of course you couldn't expose it to light, otherwise you would destroy the images. So they ended up using an autoclave trying to protect the film and interleaving it with a Kodak paper that they used. Well it worked fine for most of the simulations. And they would also introduce bacteria into some of the simulations because they wanted to make sure the autoclave was working and make sure that bacteria would be killed and he would try and grow bacteria on Petri dishes. Well things seemed to be working fine until like the day before they were going to bring back all that film and what happened is he got a phone call from his chief and said did you do something different to the film this time? And he said no, didn't do anything differently. And it turns out all of the film in the canisters that he brought back over had melted in the bottom. So you know they were of course were very concerned because here we are, we've spent how many billions of dollars going to the moon and you know we might actually destroy this flight film. And we might not have a record of what happened on Apollo 11. So they had to go back and figure out what happened. They had to fix the autoclave. They had to replumb it and they had to do another simulation to make sure everything worked safely this time. And then of course they brought back the rock boxes. They brought back the photos. Well that's photos-- the film, the canisters. And so Terry Slezak is working with this film and he notices there's a note from Buzz Aldrin that you know this is the most important magazine but Neil dropped it on the moon and he doesn't think anything of it. He pulls it out and there's all this black dust. And everyone around him is looking at him and he's like whoa, what is that? And he's like oh it's lunar dust.  Host: Oh my God.  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: And everyone of course is kind of concerned because they're like oh well, you know, that's lunar dust and we're just in plain clothes. So they take a picture of him. He's got lunar dust. If you go on our website you can actually see it so--  Host: Oh cool.  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: he holds that up. He becomes known as the first man to touch lunar dust. [laughs] But then there are protocols that have to be followed. He has to take a shower. He has to clean up with lots of Clorox. But in the meantime of course being a photographer and knowing about this historic moment, he is mainly concerned about the film. You know he's not necessarily concerned about himself, but he's concerned that this material is really going to be too rough on the film, it's going to scratch it. And that we might lose the film anyways because of the lunar dust. So he's very concerned about this. But Terry Slezak is an interesting guy. You know he's in the lunar receiving lab, so in addition to taking care of the film he's doing a lot of other tasks. He used to be an army medic so he's taking the vitals of the crew like blood pressure and their temperatures and things like that. He's also showing films in the crew reception area to the folks. They actually brought in some films so they could actually have some entertainment when they didn't have anything else to do. But they were actually quite busy in there. He also was helping to safe the command module. The command module made its way back to the Lunar Receiving Lab and there were a lot of toxins in there that had to be removed. He said he went out to North American and learned how to safe the vehicle and learned a lot about the plumbing. And he was told look, I have enough to do because he was also in charge of taking photos inside the Lunar Receiving Lab. And they said oh you can just add it to your list, no big deal. He also helped clean out the command module and he said it was kind of a gross, yucky task. There were things in there that nobody would want to touch like used wash cloths, you know? When they would shave there'd be all these whiskers on there and things and they had to document everything that they took out and put it on a list. So, you know, he was quite busy. And he actually talks about what life was like in the Lunar Receiving Lab. He said it was just crazy, that people were constantly calling. They wanted to know, like what was going on. He said people would call at like 3 o'clock in the morning, hey you know we just want to know what's going on in the Lunar Receiving Lab and he's like I'm trying to sleep. [laughs] Like, what do you think is going on?  Host: He slept in the receiving lab?  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: Yeah. Yeah.  Host: Wow.  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: So.  Host: Random people or like managers and like--?  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: He said it was their secretary.  Host: Okay.  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: So, but you know I imagine that there were a lot of people, probably the news media as well--  Host: Oh yeah.  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: you know wanting the stories. And he was taking photos. He said he would post photos of what was happening in the Lunar Receiving Lab, you know, so people could come take photos of those photos. So, you know, there was a lot happening. There was a lot of attention on these guys and this building. Even though the mission was over.  Host: Right.  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: Yeah.  Host: Yeah. I guess mission-- yeah the mission itself but maybe not the entirety of the mission. All the processing afterwards that happens especially the moon rocks and all. Every-- all the scientists probably wanted them too. This Terry Slezak you said?  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: Mm-hmm. Yeah.  Host: A very interesting guy. Photographer. Former medic. Technician. Movie--  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: Yeah.  Host: Like he made it into a movie theater. Janitor. He was cleaning stuff.  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: [Laughs] right.  Host: Very interesting stuff, yeah. A man with many hats. Very, very cool. There's an interesting story about the flag on Apollo 11. I think this is a very good one too.  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: Yeah. Yeah. So Jack Kinzler who we talked about who was our first oral history interview--  Host: Yeah.  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: You know head of our-- chief of tech services here at JSC. Well MSC at the time. You know he was called into a committee that Bob Gilruth had in his office and they were talking about, you know, what they might do to celebrate this lunar landing. Like how can we demonstrate-- we did it. What can we do on the moon? And so the first thing that he suggested was well there needs to be a plaque. You know, something that demonstrates what happened. You know something where people can look and see, or another creature can look and see what we did. So he decided to go back and come up with some dummy plaques. And so he came up with the idea of a plaque with a flag on top of it, and sort of the astronaut's name and then he presented that to Bob Gilruth and the rest of the committee and they said oh okay, you know, we'll think about that. And they sent it up to headquarters. Headquarters worked on the wording and then they came back with-- and I wanted to make sure I got it right so I brought. “Here men from the planet Earth”-- excuse me, sorry my eyes – “set foot upon the moon July 1969 A.D. We came in peace for all mankind.” Which interestingly enough I read in an interview with Tom Paine who said that originally they wanted to say we come in peace for mankind but the White House who also had a chance to review the plaque changed it to came. And they also decided to add the president's name to the bottom because originally Jack Kinzler said they weren't going to include the president because this was a NASA endeavor.  Host: Sure.  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: It didn't involve the White House. But they decided to go ahead and put Richard Nixon's name on there.  Host: Wow.  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: And you also notice on the plaque itself that there's the two hemispheres. He said that Bob Gilruth was looking at the plaque and he saw the flag and he said you know it might be more interesting actually if you put the two hemispheres there because if there's another creature that comes upon the moon, someday wants to figure out well where's Earth, you know they're not necessarily going to know where Earth is, but they could look and see this image and know oh that's the planet. That's where they came from.  Host: Ah.  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: And so he said that's where the idea originally came from. So the flag though was also something that Jack Kinzler was very interested in because he thought, you know, that would be a great way to mark the moment, to unfurl the flag on the moon. And you know you would think well that's easy, we'll just go down to Sears or Kmart and we'll just buy a flag.  Host: Yeah.  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: And you actually couldn't do that. So they had to come up with a flagpole and they had to come up with something that could be stowed on the lunar module and so they came up with this flag. It was the three foot by five foot flag that they came up with and decided how it was going to operate. They had to test it out. They also had to make sure it would fit on the lunar module so they went out to the lunar module that they have here and made sure it would all fit, they would be able to tuck it away safely. And then he had to go down and actually train the astronauts in how to deploy the flag on the moon. So he had to go down to the Kennedy Space Center and show Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin how this was all going to work. So they had to practice. And then he installed the flag on the lunar module along with the plaque before it went up to the moon. So you know a lot of people-- you probably hear a lot of conspiracy stories about how of course we didn't really go to the moon. A lot of people say well one reason is because if you look at that flag that's on the moon, it looks like it's fluttering in the wind. Well, Jack Kinzler had come up with this idea because of course they wanted you to be able to see the flag so they actually stitched a hem on this flag and they had an aluminum rod that would go through. You were actually supposed to completely stretch it out so it'd be completely straight for the photos. But the crew noticed that it would-- if was kind of fluttering, you know the way it might flutter here on Earth and so they didn't extend that aluminum rod that whole way. They decided to leave it where it looked like it was fluttering.  Host: Ah.  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: And so to this day a lot of people say well of course it's on a sound stage somewhere in Burbank or what have you, and but he had designed it that way.  Host: Wow. So it would've been-- if they'd just pulled it out just all the way it would've been a completely stiff flag which was the design of it.  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: Yeah. Right. It would've been taught, yes.  Host: Yeah. Interesting. Yeah, that's one of those things but it's, yeah it's just, they didn't pull the rod out all the way.  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: Right, yeah.  Host: Interesting.  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: Yeah.  Host: Wow. That's cool. I like that. I don't know if this is a true story so I don't even know if I should tell it but it was just one of those things when because when I first started working here I started giving tours of the Apollo 11 Mission Control Room--  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: Oh yeah.  Host: which is now being restored here on Friday. So or they're going to open it up to the public on Friday. But one of the things we used to tell was that plaque that you were saying, I believe they made three of them if I'm not mistaken. The plaque that they actually put on the moon, they had a replica of it in that room and it was hanging on the wall underneath one of the flags that they brought to the moon which actually ended up being one of the Apollo 11 flags through some story that I won't tell here. But it literally said the same exact thing that you just said, we came in peace for all mankind. And the story that we always used to tell was that there were three plaques made by three different contractors and every one of those contractors wanted to know-- they were identical plaques-- they wanted to know which plaque ended up on the moon so that contractor can say my plaque, and they, and I guess no one ever told them or no one ever knew which one was which so that way they can all share credit.  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: Right.  Host: And I forget where that third one is. One's here and the other one's on the moon and I think the other one I want to say is in the Smithsonian so I can't say for sure.  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: Yeah I hadn't heard that story before.  Host: Yeah. Yeah it was one of those things that we always used to tell. It was really cool. They had like little artifacts all around the moon and I think they're going to bring them all back for the Apollo MOCR opening here soon.  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: Oh well that's great.  Host: Yeah. But it was just one of those stories. I love that story. I think this is a great story to end it all off because we started with, you know, some shuttle astronauts recalling seeing the moon landing as a kid. We went even before the moon landing to say this is when shuttle started and we went all the way through but, you know, after the astronauts landed of course you know you were saying the whole world was celebrating. And so the astronauts went around the world to celebrate with them. And it was sort of this parade. So what was this thing? What was the, this I guess parade of astronauts going all around the world?  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: Yeah so there was a goodwill tour that the president sent the astronauts and their wives on. And so it was a tour of 22 countries in 38 days so it was sort of this whirlwind tour.  Host: Wow.  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: And we have an interview with one of the secretaries who went with the crew and their wives. Geneva Barnes tells some interesting stories from that great, or \"Giant leaps\" tour and you know it was just an exhausting tour. You know they would spend a night at every location except for I think she mentioned Bankok and Rome. You know they were just constantly on the move. They had a plane. They were in the Vice President's plane, Air Force Two which they considered really their home away from home. They had meals there. They could drink the water there. They could take naps. So it was really nice for them because they were constantly on the move. Everyone just wanted a piece of the astronauts. Everybody wanted to see them. Crowds were everywhere. You know the first place that they went, Mexico City, I mean if you've ever seen the photos, I mean it's just amazing how close the crowds are to the Apollo 11 crew.  Host: Wow.  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: And she talks about the fact that they were so busy-- they were so jetlagged, they were constantly moving around. They weren't, you know, as you and I do when we go on travel, we're probably tired. We're not eating well. We're not sleeping well because we're not in our own beds. And she said that a lot of the embassies, the state department embassies would talk to each other when they were coming, when they were scheduled to come, and they would talk about the fact that well, you know, there have been some illnesses on the crew, you know these-- because they didn't just come with the wives and the astronauts and Geneva Barnes, there were other people that came. And they were worried that well maybe you know that quarantine period wasn't long enough because maybe the crew actually did bring back some sort of lunar germ because everyone's been getting sick and some people had flu-like symptoms. And the physician that came with them, Dr. Carpentier who was also onboard the mobile quarantine facility and in the LRO--  Host: I remember the name, yeah.  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: Yeah. So he had to actually go talk to the media when they were in London and explain, no the crew didn't bring back any lunar bugs, you know? They were just tired. They were just, you know, they had a hectic schedule and they were just kind of worn out which I think is, you know, kind of amusing that people would actually be concerned about that. They had already gone through a quarantine.  Host: Yeah well it was, I mean this, we've brought up this idea of a lunar bug through so many different parts of this story. You could tell it was just something that was so prominent in the world.  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: Mm-hmm. Yeah. Well you know it was a big fear.  Host: Sure.  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: A big unknown at that point.  Host: An unknown, exactly.  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: Yeah. And we still would quarantine the crews, you know? And we still quarantined 12 and 14 just to be sure even though the Apollo 11 crew was fine. But she also tells a number of other interesting stories. She talks about for instance going to Belgrade. They met the deputy prime minister there and they invited the astronauts out for a duck shoot and they took their wives on a tour down the Danube River and they took them out for a seven course lunch and they said that they were so full. And that lasted until four or five in the afternoon and then they got word that well the chef's back at the hotel they were staying at got a hold of the ducks and they were planning this huge dinner for them. So they were, you know, stuffed already from this huge meal.  Host: Right.  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: And they had to go back to the hotel and get ready for dinner and eat whatever the chefs had come up with using these ducks. They really only had one rest stop that she remembers. When they went to Rome she couldn't remember if there was an American ambassador there at the embassy at the time but they gave them the afternoon there at the embassy. So they had a chance to just really relax and be themselves and play tennis. And she mentions that they ate hamburgers and hot dogs and potato salad. I mean how much more American can you get, right? [laughter]  Host: Probably much needed after this, you know-- was that probably towards the middle of the tour too, just a break.  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: Yeah I think they really needed it because there were so many crowds. She talks about going to Senegal for instance in Dakar. And she said the plane landed and these crowds just rushed toward the plane. They had to turn off the jets because they were just like here come all these people, you know just tons and tons of people. They finally managed to get them out and into cars and she said that was challenging as well because, you know, they were supposed to be following each other to the hotel but she said they're-- people managed to wedge their way in between the vehicles. She said it was so scary because at one point security came back and told them to get out of their vehicle because they were taking their car for the astronaut wives. And they said find another way-- find another car-- and she was like how are we going to find another car? They managed but she said they were all kind of squished on each other, sitting on each other's laps. She said it was just so crazy. At one point the car that had the astronauts started to overheat and she said she doesn't understand the mechanics but she said she'd heard that if you want to make sure your car doesn't overheat, you turn on the heater and that sort of helps things.  Host: Oh.  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: And so she said they ended up taking a shortcut through a soccer field and made their way to the hotel which she said it was just a very scary moment because people were just, you know, they wanted to see these astronauts, hear these celebrities that came back from the moon. And they wanted a picture of them or just a glimpse of them.  Host: Everybody was going nuts. Wow.  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: They were. Yeah they had space fever, you know?  Host: Yeah.  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: And when they went to Bombay in India, she said a lot of people from the embassy didn't go out but they estimated there were about a million and a half people who were there just to see the astronauts.  Host: Wow. Huge country. Huge population.  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: So, huge crowds. Yeah.  Host: Yeah huge crowd.  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: Yeah. And then she said when they went to the Congo which is a very different story from when they went to Senegal, she said that there was a lot, a lot more crowd control there because the president had put in place these police officers with whips. So if somebody tried to step out and go to the plane or get in front of an astronaut car or try and open the door a whip would come down on them and they'd scurry back to the sidewalk or the location that they were supposed to be at. Like kind of scary.  Host: Yeah.  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: Yeah.  Host: Imagine like seeing that.  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: Yeah. She said that the place that they ended up staying was outside of town. It was near a private zoo that the president owned and you could actually hear the animals at night, the wild animals. So, you know there's some interesting stories from there. Probably the other interesting story she told was when they went to Tehran they were actually able to see the jewels that the Shah had. And they were locked away behind glass and so they told them don't touch the glass with your forehead or your hands. It'll create a huge problem. Then of course somebody didn't follow directions and so doors-- alarms went off, doors started shutting. They managed to get everybody out in time but, you know, that was probably another scary moment.  Host: Wow.  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: Yeah.  Host: I mean these stories are incredible, the ones Geneva is telling. But I can just imagine trying to-- because she's the secretary, she's part of the organization of this--  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: Yes.  Host: trying to come up with alternate routes if you're getting broken up and now you have to deal with okay now the doors are closing on us and alarms are going off, what do we do? That had to be one of the most stressful like tours that you could possibly go on with that many people just so excited in every single place you go. And I think that's one of the great things about this mission is how it captivated the whole world. I know-- I think it's in the book \"Marketing the Moon\", I forget exactly the number so this might not be a good thing to quote but I'll do it anyway, is I think 95% of the world's televisions were tuned into the moon landing I believe. Everybody was. Now again this is a time when there was three channels but you know it's, it was one of those things where everybody was tuned in. So naturally everyone would be excited and all the papers would say man landed on the moon. And it was for all of mankind too so everyone was engaging with it.  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: Right, yes.  Host: It was just a wonderful thing.  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: I mean the United States accomplished this goal but I think the whole world saw it as an opportunity as Neil Armstrong said-- a giant leap for mankind. He didn't say it was a giant leap for the United States of America.  Host: Right.  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: Yeah.  Host: Yeah. And that was intentional, right? They thought about that ahead of time.   [ Transition Sound ]  Host: Hope you really enjoyed these stories from Dr. Ross-Nazzal. It was some great stuff. And thanks for sticking around. We have a few more stories to tell but these will be told by the people who actually experienced them. At the beginning I mentioned we made a video at Rice Stadium very recently and had a chance to pull aside some alumni of the Apollo Program who had some interesting stories. So, here they are. I hope you enjoy. First is George Fletcher who actually experienced John F. Kennedy's speech at Rice Stadium.  [ Transition Sound ]  George Fletcher: Okay I'm George Fletcher. I was about in the 7th grade when we were sitting in class and all of the sudden the teacher comes running into the classroom, everybody up, everybody up. And so we all got up. They hustled us out to the bus and we got on the bus and somewhere along the line we learned we were going to go listen to the president. Okay, fine. So we went out to Rice Stadium and they had us come off the bus, get into the stands, and we all sat prim and proper just like we'd always been taught and we listened to the president. Well I say we listened, I was in the 7th grade and so I wasn't all that excited about what he had to say, at least not at that point in time, but we listened politely. And it was hot. It was very hot. And after it was over, we got back on the bus and had to go back to school. But it was a very exciting time because when I look back on it and see the importance of what he was saying at that time, and then for me to graduate from school and go to work in the space program, it means a lot more to me now that I was there. I appreciate being there.  Interviewer: So what did you in the space program? Tell me about your adult life?  George Fletcher: I worked-- started out as a quality engineer but transitioned over to systems safety and I've been in systems safety for nearly 40 years.  Interviewer: So were you a NASA contractor or--?  George Fletcher: Contractor, yes.  Interviewer: Okay.  George Fletcher: And I started out, the last four days-- I came to the center on the last four days of Skylab 4 and after that I went through the ASTP program, went through the complete shuttle program, did some with space station, and now I'm back doing Orion.  [ Transition Sound ]  Host: Here's Don Whalen who actually worked on all the unmanned and manned missions of the Apollo Program.  [ Transition Sound ]  Interviewer: What was your technical expertise?  Don Whalen: The Environmental Control System. I worked on the-- it's called the ECS, the Environmental Control System on the command module for Apollo. And we, you know, worked on the design, development, test, certification, and mission readiness for the system.  Interviewer: Now I don't want you to get like mad about astronauts, but talk about the people behind the scenes. You know you see all these movies and you always see the, you know, Tom Hanks doesn't play you. [laughs] How many people, you know, go into all that amazing stuff that happens and is in front of the cameras and, you know, the going to the moon and all this? How many people go behind the scenes and what's the importance of the workers behind all that stuff?  Don Whalen: Well the workers behind the scenes is what gets the job done. We were in the engineering directorate. Unfortunately all you hear, a lot of the people hear, is mission control. But we wouldn't have had any missions without us in engineering designing, development, and certifying the system to keep them living. So we worked hand in hand with the guys in mission control, but it seems like that's all the general public knows is mission control. [laughs]  Interviewer: Yeah. Seems like they need somebody like you designing environmental systems for a moon base.  Don Whalen: [Laughs] They've probably already got something in mind already you know? But, yeah no we work, we work with the contractors. You know AIR Research out in Downy, out in California, designed the environmental control system for the command module. So, and then we used to take trips out there. The unfortunate thing that is always in my mind is the Apollo 1 fire. And I had just left mission control working with the guys and on the way home that's when it happened. So we had a lot of going through to do and, you know, get ready again. It was an unfortunate situation.  Interviewer: The timeline for getting, for you know failures and then getting somebody on the moon. At the time was it an unbelievable task what y’all were doing, because that's the way it's kind of described, you know, when you hear about the history of it.  Don Whalen: Yeah well we were zeroed in on our subsystem. That was our job, to get it ready. Everybody el- all the other subsystems were in the same boat. All this stuff about beating Russia to the moon and all was at the upper levels and they were controlling what we did, but it was our job to get our subsystem ready and certified for flight. And that's what we did.  [ Transition Sound ]  Host: Here's Gary Evans and Jim Kelly, both of whom were EECOM and were reunited at this video shoot.   [ Transition Sound ]  Host: Gentlemen, thank you so much for coming. I'm just going to ask you a couple questions. First, when you were invited to come to this event to film at Rice Stadium with all of these Apollo alumni, current JSC employees, and even current astronauts, what really drew you to come today?  Gary Evans: It seemed like a good idea.  Jim Kelly: Yeah.   Gary Evans: We got a lot of things coming up and there's going to be a lot of media building up for that so I thought I'd support this. I'm really curious to see how the film's going to look from perspective of being on the field with all the people. It was a lot of fun. Lot of fun. It was good to see the people too. Lot of friends here today.  Host: It's like a reunion.  Jim Kelly: I was kind of just enjoying recognition for a lot of old folks that did a good job back then that have probably long been forgotten.  Gary Evans: Yes.  Jim Kelly: There's a-- it was a lot of hard work, a lot of people and I just came down hopefully to see some of my old buddies. I found one by the way. [laughs] Gary and I worked together for quite a few times.  Host: What were you doing then? What were you working on during the Apollo program?  Jim Kelly: Both of us were flight controllers. We were in the Mission Control Center and we both supported the position EECOM.  Host: What were some of the highlights of your time as EECOM?  Gary Evans: EECOM? Well it was, the whole ride was 40 years and a week so it started a long time ago and just to be there and to participate in support was more than anybody would ever expect. We were the luckiest people around to get the opportunity.  Host: Do you remember where you were during the Apollo moon landing?  Jim Kelly: Yes. On console. I was one of the few that followed the flight plan rather than a mission schedule. My sys- one of my systems expertise besides the electrical communication and instrumentation and sequential systems was the docking system. So I was there in the event that they aborted the landing and we had to re-dock. In the event that we had a problem I was the resident docking specialist for hardware.  Host: And how about you Gary?  Gary Evans: I was still in California. I had been here during the Gemini Program and supported a lot of the EVAs and the hardware. We built the umbilical and the chest pack for that so I had known a lot of the people in building seven-- the crew systems division-- and I'd been supporting Apollo for the entire time also. So we worked a lot of integration but I was busy working on something on the west coast.  Host: Can you tell me do you remember where you were during JFK's speech?  Jim Kelly: Yeah I was still in high school.  Host: Really?  Jim Kelly: Yeah. I was sitting out-- my father was military and we were stationed in Germany and we'd just got back from our German assignment and I was in my senior year of high school and that's where I was and lord and behold, a couple of years later I was just one of them.  Gary Evans: And I was working in California still on the Environmental Control System for Apollo and for Gemini which was still going at the time. And JFK did something for us also. Some of us were on the critical path for getting to the moon and they went out and saw that we didn't have to get, to go to Vietnam. They kind of I guess protected us where we ended up on a list, a bunch of us, and we were fortunate to do that.  Host: Wonderful.  Gary Evans: So, it was a, he was a smart man but he was really ready to go and he got everybody fired up, I'll tell you. It was a good thing. It was good times.  Host: Now last thing, those badges are pretty interesting. Can you tell me what they mean?  Jim Kelly: Mine's a mission badge for Apollo 11 I wore. It gave me access to the control center. So I've got one of these from GT 76 all the way through the Soyuz Mission. I was a mission controller.  Host: How about yours Gary?  Gary Evans: I worked for Rockwell International at the time and I worked for Apollo 16, 15, 14, 17, so I supported those in Mission Control as a life support in the background.  [ Transition Sound ]  Host: Lastly, here's Reuben Taylor. He was one of the managers for the ascent propulsion system on the lunar module and has a great story of how critical that component was.  [ Transition Sound ]  Reuben Taylor: I was, I came to Houston to be one of the managers for the ascent propulsion system on the lunar module. I came to Houston in 1964 and so we worked the system all the way up through the last Apollo landing. And one of the interesting things that-- Neil Armstrong, before we ever went to land on the moon, called over said hey would you come over, I want to talk to you about redesigning the engines. And what he wanted us to do was to put in manual valves to start the engine in case he didn't have electrical power. And I said well that's a tough order. So I said if you're concerned about the-- not having electrical power, well we've got electrical strings coming in from multiple sources so we're not really concerned about power. But in addition, if you do lose power, you've got to have power for the reaction control systems which stabilize you as you're coming off the moon. And so it's, there's a lot here that you're asking us to do. I didn't tell him but we were also on a tight schedule and it was not really a very practical thing to do because our rocket engines started up in like three tenths of a second we were almost 100% power. So after listening me out he says okay, thanks for coming over and the end of conversation. [laughs] So we did not have to go redesign the engine. The thing about the ascent propulsion system, it was the only component on the entire Apollo program that did not have a backup, okay? If that engine failed, that's it. The guys stay on the moon. We had one engine, no backup system. That engine had to fire up and we used hypergolic propellants. It was no spark plugs or anything to start. No igniters. You mixed the propellants and they automatically start to burn. And the thing about Apollo 13 was I was home getting ready to go to bed, it was about 10:30 o'clock and one of my co-workers called me and says hey you better come up here, we've got a problem. [laughs] And so I went up there and found out that the guys were transferring into the lunar module and, to make it around, all the way around the moon and back. So I had an interesting time here at NASA and I retired in 1987 and just had a blast.  [ Transition Sound ]  Host: These, Jennifer, are absolutely fascinating stories. And I think I'm going to kind of reiterate that point that was, you know, we see a lot when we think about Apollo 11, you know we like to look at Neil Armstrong, Buzz Aldrin. We like to look at Gene Kranz which were, you know, astounding figures in the history. And I was so excited to dive into some of the lesser known stories. This was absolutely fascinating, so I appreciate you coming on Jennifer to tell these wonderful, wonderful stories. This was very exciting.  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: Yeah, it's my pleasure. And I hope if folks are interested they'll go out and look at the oral histories. Like I said we've got over 1,000 on the website and there's a lot of material out there, great material waiting to be mined.  Host: Wow. Please do.  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: Yeah.  Host: Thank you so much.  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: Thank you.  [ Music ]  Host: Hey thanks for sticking around. Once again and so we can sort of tie the bow on this episode, we are in the middle of the 50th anniversary of the Apollo missions. Of course today's episode being just before the landing on the—the historic landing on the moon, July 20th 1969, 50 years later. So if you want to see other things that we are doing here on \"Houston We Have a Podcast\", we have a page for that, NASA.gov/Johnson/HWHAP/Apollo50th. We are putting all of our Apollo episodes from various Apollo missions and collecting them, including some of these lesser known stories, a lot of which we explored today. If you want to know more just about the Apollo 50th, go to NASA.gov/specials/Apollo50th. Lots of resources. Lots of history that you can just peruse. And if you are listening to some of the podcasts here on \"Houston We Have a Podcast\", and that's still not enough for you, we have other NASA podcasts and you can go to NASA.gov/podcast to go find those. I know specifically Gravity Assist, NASA in Silicon Valley, Rocket Ranch and a new NASA podcast called NASA Explores Apollo from the Goddard Space Flight Center are doing some special episodes around the 50th anniversary of Apollo 11 and you should check those out. Otherwise we're going to be talking about it all across our social media platforms so head to Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and check out some of the NASA pages that we have for you and some of the Apollo 50th content. Use the hashtag #askNASA on any one of those platforms to submit an idea for the show. And if you'd like to bring it on here, just make sure to mention it's for \"Houston We Have a Podcast\". This episode was recorded on June 26th, 2019. Thanks to Alex Perryman, Pat Ryan, Norah Moran, and Kelly Humphries. Thanks to the small team here at the Johnson Space Center and at Rice University for helping to bring the Rice video shoot together and share resources with recording these interviews. And of course to the over 160 people that came out for the video including the Apollo alumni featured in today's episode. And of course thanks once again to Dr. Jennifer Ross-Nazzal for coming on the show and gathering these lesser known stories to share with us today.

                        "description": "Pat Ryan (Host): Houston, we have a podcast. Welcome to the official podcast of the NASA Johnson Space Center. This is Episode 102, \"The Next First Steps.\" I'm Pat Ryan. On this podcast, we talk with scientists, engineers, astronauts, and other folks about their part in America's space exploration program, and today, that means getting their thoughts on space exploration of the past, as well as of the future. We hope you've heard -- NASA's been celebrating the 50th anniversary of the Apollo 11 moon landing -- big parties. Well, two weeks ago, Gary talked with NASA administrator Jim Bridenstine about the significance of the anniversary, and the agency's current plans to return astronauts to the Moon in the next few years. Last week, he and JSC historian Jennifer Ross-Nazzal hit on some of the lesser-known stories of Apollo 11, and we heard a few Apollo veterans share their memories of when they made history. The thing about that history is, the chances are you don't remember it. About 65% of the population of the United States today is under the age of 50. That means for roughly two out of every three people you meet, the first landing of human beings on the Moon is a topic from history for them. It's not something they experienced. Well, I do remember 1969, and believe me, it was a huge deal. The fact of NASA meeting President Kennedy's goal of landing men on the Moon in the 1960s was mind-boggling for those of a certain age who never even conceived of such a thing in all their natural-born days. And for many of those who were children during that historic summer, it set their lives on a new course of scientific and technical study, and for some of them, a career in the space program. Over the last few weeks, I've had a chance to put a microphone in front of some of the leaders of the human spaceflight programs and offices at NASA today, to hear their memories of Apollo 11 and learn how that influenced their lives. But also to get them to share their thoughts on the value of putting the “human” in human spaceflight, and to talk about why they're so jazzed about the emphasis within NASA today of creating a sustainable human presence on the Moon soon. As you're about to hear, these discussions of the past very quickly turned into dreams of the future that go far beyond the Moon. Ready? Here we go.  [ Music ]  Host: We can read about history and study it as a set of facts, or we can try to get inside the history by living it through the experience of others. It turns out that most of the people who are leading NASA's human spaceflight programs today have their very own real memories of the Apollo 11 moon landing that happened 50 years ago this month. It was, for them, a real thing -- an experience they lived. And today, they can talk about it so the rest of us can share it, and can see how it informs today's human spaceflight programs, and how it's influencing what NASA plans to do next, starting with the return of astronauts to the Moon by 2024. Eagle landed on the Moon on a Sunday afternoon at 3:18 Houston time. Neil Armstrong put his first boot print in the Moon dust at 9:56 that evening. So most of the kids of that day were all in exactly the same place to see this piece of history unfold. They were in front of the TV, at home, with their parents, and that included several of those who would grow up to work in the human spaceflight program, and who, today, are in positions of leadership, including Mark Geyer, the director of NASA's Johnson Space Center in Houston.  Mark Geyer: I was 11, and so -- and I lived in Idaho at the time, Boise, Idaho. We had three channels -- no ABC, just the other three. We had a PBS, and so we had three channels.  Host: Nice.  Mark Geyer: And I remember that day -- my brother and I, we went to the convenience store and bought those space sticks you might remember, and they were like chalky-tasting sticks. There was vanilla, chocolate -- but there was -- cool, because it was like you were in space. We did that, and then, when it landed -- and then, I remember it being in the evening. I've talked about it before -- using our fireplace tools, pretending I was collecting rocks on the surface, as Neil was -- Neil and Buzz were walking around. So I remember that. I remember the living room. I can -- and my mom was there. She stayed up with me, and we watched it together. So that was really cool.  Host: The International Space Station program manager, Kirk Shireman, and the Orion program manager, Mark Kirasich, have similar memories.  Kirk Shireman: I remember as a young child -- I guess I was six years old. I remember, very distinctly, watching the first steps on the Moon. You know, it was a big deal for our family. I remember the quality of the TV wasn't very good, although at that time, I don't think it was a big deal. Even now, I remember -- I remember the quality not being that good, but that was amazing, to be -- even see it.  Mark Kirasich: Oh, my goodness, I -- it is clear and distinctive like it was yesterday, one of the most vivid memories of growing up. It was July 1969. I was nine years old at the time. I was sitting in the living room of my family's house where I grew up -- in case you were wondering, 1500 South Highland Ave in Lombard, Illinois.  Host: Okay, we'll all run there now [laughter].  Mark Kirasich: Yes.  Host: Look at the picture.  Mark Kirasich: And I was -- I was sitting on the couch in our living room with my dad on one side of me, and my little six-year-old sister on the other side of me. And we watched the landing, and I was glued to the TV set. And after Neil and Buzz actually walked on the Moon -- while they were walking on the Moon, there was a cut-away to a commercial or something. My sister and I dragged my father out and into the street, because we wanted to look up at the Moon and find Buzz and Neil. We didn't that night, but it was clearly one of the most vivid memories I have from my childhood.  Host: The memory of that day is a little bit different for the woman who, today, is the manager of NASA's commercial crew program, and that's because Kathy Lueders was in a very different time zone 50 years ago.  Kathy Lueders: We're all getting old.  Host: I know.  Kathy Lueders: I mean, I have a memory of Apollo 11.  Host: So do I. Yeah [laughter].  Kathy Lueders: But I -- it's -- it's of my dad. I was living in Tokyo at the time, and my dad woke us all up early, and said, \"You need to come down, because this is, like, a memorable moment.\" So we come down the stairs, and of course, on a black-and-white screen, you know, dragging us in, and you just see this little picture of people climbing down a ladder and standing on the Moon. And I -- and, you know, at the time, I was five. And so -- you know, but it's always been this kind of distant memory of seeing people on TV standing on the Moon. That's just amazing.  Host: John McCullough had something of a different-than-usual experience of the first moon landing, too. Fifty years ago, the man who now oversees the Johnson Space Center's support of all NASA exploration objectives as director of exploration integration and science was a preschooler on a family road trip.  John McCullough: I absolutely do. I have actually three space memories from when I was very young, very formidable, that stuck with me, and still stick with me today. And so, the first one is Apollo 11. I was four-and-a-half years old. We were on a family vacation. We traveled 1000 miles from -- I lived in Ohio, and we were going to Minnesota to visit some family friends. And I remember going across the Mackinac Bridge, this big, giant bridge, and I remember stopping and watching in the black-and-white TV the Apollo 11 landing. And that was a huge, huge moment. The whole family gathered around and watched that piece of it. So it was a big deal.  Host: You didn't stop and watch it in the car?  John McCullough: No, no. We were -- we were at a house, so it was good. But it was a little black-and-white, you know, console TV. I remember it vividly. So we still talk about that periodically.  Host: There are some leaders of human spaceflight in America today who are too young to remember Apollo 11, like Lara Kearney, the deputy manager of the Gateway program, and Steve Koerner, the director of flight crew operations at JSC.  Lara Kearney: Yeah, I was about seven months old when Apollo 11 happened, so I don't have a direct memory of Apollo 11. But I do -- by the time the Apollo program was coming to the end, they were flying their last few flights, I was about three, three-and-a-half. And I do remember that.   Host: Really?  Lara Kearney: I remember watching on the television with my family, and seeing something that looked really cool on the television. I -- you know, looking back at it now, I had no concept of what a significant achievement it was at the time, but I definitely remember watching it on television with the family.  Host: And having some understanding of what was happening?  Lara Kearney: Yeah, I definitely think so. I mean, it was clear to me at the time that it was a man, and that man was on the Moon, and that was very different than being on the earth [laughter]. So, you know, even as a child, I understood that that was kind of a big deal. Just -- you know, at that point, no appreciation for the magnitude of the effort that had to come together to make something like that really happen.  Steve Koerner: You know, I was very, very young on Apollo 11, so I don't have a specific memory that ties me to Apollo 11. I do remember two things in the Apollo program. I can't pintail them to an exact mission, but watching on a grainy black-and-white television Apollo astronauts standing on the Moon -- I couldn't even tell you, at that age, who -- what -- which astronaut it was standing there. But I can remember family gathered around, watching on this grainy black-and-white television an Apollo astronaut standing on the Moon. At the age I was at, I don't think I appreciated the significance at the time. Fast-forward a couple years later, and I believe it was an Apollo Soyuz capsule that we went out in the backyard and we watched in the night sky as it circled the earth. We could see it go overhead, and even then, at a young age, in the early '70s, thinking, \"How is that possible? People are on that?\" And I remember just questioning the how.  Host: Others of today's leaders are younger still. For Holly Ridings, the chief of the flight director office here in Houston today, her first memory of Apollo 11 came from a science teacher.  Holly Ridings: Wow. The first thing I remember learning about Apollo 11 -- so I was very young when I sort of had some awareness of space. So this is elementary school.  Host: Okay.  Holly Ridings: And I had an amazing science teacher. Her name was Ms. Daniel. We called her Science Daniel, not necessarily to her face, and so she really was excited about space. And of course, being the age I am, we would go to the cafeterias and watch the shuttle launch at the time. Again, this is about the sixth grade, but, you know, she did an amazing job of explaining to us, you know, space, and how we'd arrived at that point, which obviously -- you know, you had the Apollo missions that came first, much before we had the shuttle. And so, you know, that's kind of my first memory of understanding, you know, one, the concept of human spaceflight, right, and just that amazing endeavor, and two, the history of how we'd arrived, you know, at that point in time, again, when I was about in the sixth grade.  Host: As the leaders of America's human space exploration programs today experienced the Apollo 11 moon landing in different ways, so too were they influenced by it in different ways. For people like Mark Kirasich, the impact of Apollo 11 was direct, and its influence never wavered through their lives.  Mark Kirasich: It not only inspired my education and career, it changed a lot about my family's life for me, starting with our next family vacation. We -- in the summer of 1970, our family vacationed down at the Kennedy Space Center. We were in Coco Beach. I still drive by the hotel on the A1A Highway where we stayed that year. So it changed a lot about my life. I was really -- Apollo inspired me, if you will. It interested me in science and math, and I don't know that I was smart enough at the time to know I wanted to work in the control center, wanted to be the flight director. But it definitely pulled me in that direction.  Host: And was that what you studied in school, for example?  Mark Kirasich: Yeah, that's when -- and I went to high school, studied math, science, and I was an engineer at the University of Notre Dame.  Host: Most of the others say that the Apollo 11 mission was a strong part of an influence that was exerted both before and after those couple of weeks in July 50 years ago. Here's Steve Koerner, and then Mark Geyer.  Steve Koerner: At the time, I don't think, either watching the Apollo event on the television or seeing that capsule in the sky, I definitively said, \"Hey, that's what I want to do.\" I just wasn't knowledgeable enough in knowing, at that young age, what that even entailed. But as I -- as I aged, as I watched rocket launches subsequent to that, that same inquisitive \"how\" kept resonating, and ultimately, led me to look into pursuing engineering as a career choice, or a college major, to state it that way. But absolutely, I think it was linked to those events of, \"How is this possible? How is this happening?\" And as I got smarter and realized just how hard human spaceflight is -- boy, that was an incentive to pursue.  Host: And you stuck with it. You've worked at NASA your whole career, right?  Steve Koerner: Yeah. I was fortunate straight out of school. I had an internship while going to school, and was able to join NASA straight out of school. So I've been with it -- had different roles throughout the years, but human spaceflight is my passion.  Mark Geyer: It wasn't just that one moment.   Host: Okay.  Mark Geyer: I remember the Gemini launches, too. I remember -- I had tonsillitis. I remember being in the hospital, and they decided it was time to take me in. And there was a launch about to happen, and I was upset that I wasn't going to see it. So I remember the Gemini launches. I remember all the Apollo launches. My brother and I had the models. We knew how an orbit rendezvous -- we knew how all that stuff worked, at least to the level you could as a kid. So to me, the landing was a piece of that, a big piece, right, because it was success. But we'd been -- I'd been following it long before then. It was very exciting.  Host: And I take it that that was a goal for you, then, to want to be in that program in some fashion?  Mark Geyer: Yeah, I knew I wanted to be a part of it, because, one, it was very exciting. It looked very difficult, and also, that it meant something. You know, it was more than just -- I don't know. It meant something bigger than myself. It was part of a national -- actually a world thing. I mean, I just remember all these big events, how many people would stop and go to their TV -- not just the landing, but all sorts of things, Apollo 8, everything. So it just meant -- it was -- it's hard to put it into words, but it was kind of a feeling. It was more of a national focus, and I said, \"Wow, that would be great, to be a part of something like that.\"  Host: For John McCullough, the Apollo 11 landing was inspiring, and motivating, but only the first of three big events he remembers.  John McCullough: The other events -- obviously one of them is -- really, my mom was very supportive, and I would go in the backyard at a very young age and dig up rocks. And she would convince me they're moon rocks, and I was doing the right thing. And they were cool. And it was downtown Cleveland, so it was, like, pieces of concrete and stuff, you know, but it had holes in it and stuff. And she's like, \"That's a moon rock,\" you know. She's right, right? The Moon and the earth are joined, so -- so yeah, it's all joined in one piece. And then, in the early '70s, there was a comet that came through, and I remember the big deal about that comet, Kohoutek. It was a big deal, and all three of those events kind of -- by the time I was in fifth grade, I wanted to be an aerospace engineer. And I was going to do stuff in the space program.  Host: For Lara Kearney, the more direct influence came during high school from the space shuttle program, the first flight of Sally Ride, the loss of Challenger. But even that didn't set her on a course straight to NASA's door.  Lara Kearney: I was actually not one of those people that went to college saying, \"I'm going to college to go to NASA.\"   Host: Okay.  Lara Kearney: I was, again, more interested in just combining my love of engineering with my love of the, you know, human, and medicine. And towards the end of my college career, NASA was at Texas A&M, where I was a student, recruiting for biomedical engineers, or the folks that sit console, you know, during the missions, and take care of the crew. And I think just the light bulbs went off for me. I'm like, it never really dawned on me that, with that kind of background, I could work in the space industry. You usually think of aerospace engineers or things like that, and so that made a connection for me. And that's how I came this direction, is more through the biomedical engineering and space-life sciences path.  Host: Kathy Lueders started off on a path that led in an entirely different direction before she was re-vectored to the space program.  Kathy Lueders: I'm not one of those people that said from that, \"I'm going to go work for NASA.\"  Host: Right.  Kathy Lueders: I said, \"I'm going to go off and work on Wall Street,\" and then I kind of -- after going, and going and getting a business degree with a finance background, and doing a couple other things, I came back and said, \"I want to become an engineer.\" And as I was working through engineering, then I started co-oping with NASA, and started realizing really how to apply some of the practices that I'd learned through my business degree, and kind of meld it, then, with my engineering degree. And seeing kind of the value of what NASA does from an engineering fundamental -- it allows us to do a peaceful engineering job. You know, I started realizing when I was coming out of school -- and you start looking out there at what are the opportunities for engineers at the time. A lot of the defense contractors were pulling people in, and what you realized was -- I realized I had a chance, from a NASA perspective, to apply my engineering knowledge in a way that was going to further mankind. And how many places can you do that? When I was coming out of school -- and this is about early '90s. At the time, people were really struggling with, \"Am I going to go -- where am I going to go do my job? Am I going to go work in a place where I'm building a product, which is a noble goal? Am I going to go build, you know, different things that are going to make us safer?\" That's also a noble goal, but people were conflicted about the things that make you safer are also things that kill people. And so when you have a -- you -- I really realized, you know, as I working the co-op, that I have a job that I can go work to be able to further our knowledge, and perform a mission in a way that not only is going to help us as a country be able to expand, but also be able to expand our knowledge for all the people on the earth. I grew up in Japan, and so you -- when you grow up overseas, you realize that it's -- really is a world community. And as a world community, it's always been really important to me that we get to operate as a world community. And so, the great thing with NASA is, you get to operate as a world community with other space-faring nations, and it's a way to do that peacefully.  Host: For others, the influence of Apollo 11 did contribute to their education and career path, but actually became a stronger influence after they got to NASA. Kirk Shireman --  Kirk Shireman: I don't know that that event itself inspired me to come to NASA. I don't remember it that way, but I think that event really has inspired me at NASA. You know, what I remember is that, of course, people walked on the Moon. That -- the biggest thing to my life certainly since that point was that we can do anything. And so, the things that we've accomplished since then, the things that we do, I would say, every day -- there's really nothing we can't do, because we were able to put people on the Moon. So of course we can do all these things that are put in front of us. So I think it's really been more of an inspiration in terms of the boundless capacity of humans. I think we can do anything. Can we put people on Mars? There's no question in my mind, and I think it all ties back to that event as a young child.  Host: All of these folks have spent some or all of their careers working as part of the team, executing a coordinated plan to put human beings on top of the controlled explosion that is a rocket launch, and shoot those people into space to explore. I wanted to know why they feel it's important, to use the old phrase, to have a man in the can. Why do you think it's important that we send people to explore space?  Holly Ridings: I'd say for me, personally, it transcends, you know, all of the challenges we have in the world today, just with different countries, different borders, different perspectives, and if you think about it, it just ties every human together. Right? It's this amazing endeavor that takes just so much energy, and technical expertise, and fortitude. And you get up to space, and of course, I've not been myself, but you speak to the astronauts. And of course, we have the benefit of sitting in mission control, watching the beautiful pictures come down every day, and you just see the planet. And so, really, to be a part of experiencing that, and making that happen for the entire world, you know, really to move us forward as a human race.  Mark Geyer: The human mind is an incredible machine, and we -- the mind is capable of learning and adapting so much more than any computer that we may ever develop. And we saw in Apollo that, when we sent those scientists to the surface, their ability to learn, and adapt, and enhance what we were trying to do -- we just multiplied our capability so much more. You know, the rovers on Mars are incredible machines, but even then, they're limited. So that's number one. Number two, I think it is -- you know, I believe that the -- that our destiny as a species is not limited to Earth, that we will go out into the solar system. And so, to me, this is the beginning of that destiny, too.  Steve Koerner: Asking the first folks that sailed the seas, \"Why is it important?\" Or asking the first folks that flew, \"Why is it important?\" You look back, and now, it seems commonplace that, of course, it was important. But I don't know that they started off with all those answers, but that inquisitive human nature of -- this is something that ought to be pursued. So that's kind of at one almost general level. I'm not sure what the right word there is, but for me more personally, it's the opportunity to influence in a way that's significant. Human spaceflight -- I mean, I can't think of a better time to spend -- a better way to spend my time for myself personally, challenging me, but also contributing to my kids, my family. Human spaceflight is an impressive, grand, bold effort that, to me, is absolutely worth it, from a -- again, a personal perspective. In anything I do, I look for three things. I want to have fun. I want to provide value, and I want to learn something. And I challenge somebody to point out something other than human spaceflight that could more maximize those three things.  Host: Now, we do -- we have explored space without people. We've sent robots, and landed them on Mars, for example. Why is it important to send people out there?  Steve Koerner: Yeah, I think sending people is significant from the perspective of adaptable, flexible, understanding the situation, being able to respond to the unknown. If it were routine that we could write a script that allowed a robot to pick up a rock, fine, but if we programmed it to drill an inch, and we realized, you know what, two inches -- I see something there. I can respond. I can adapt. Just having that ability to overcome obstacles, being able to reason and think makes sense to me from a practical perspective. And don't get me wrong -- I think this -- robots serve a huge, huge piece of this, and being able to go with the technology that's available. Man, that only makes the human aspect more important, but -- exciting.  Mark Kirasich: Yeah, well, there's something about having a person, having a human on a mission. First of all, take our -- take our one orbital flight test to date, exploration flight test one. It was -- there was nobody on board. It was a four-hour flight, but it was a flight that went higher in altitude, in a more energetic orbit than any other spacecraft designed for people had done since the Apollo program. And it -- and I had a feeling -- I think everybody in the program at the time had a feeling for a short period of time, a couple hours before and after on that day -- it felt like the whole world stopped to watch, because here we were doing something really bold, really brave again. So it's -- I think it's -- there's a factor -- there's something that happens when you bring people into this endeavor that changes it from just a machine to something that more people relate to, get excited about.  Host: Does it make it seem more real to people, do you think? Is it something like that? That it could be me over there?  Mark Kirasich: I think so. I think so. That's definitely -- it's one of the reasons -- it's one of the -- one of the feelings that affected me, yes. Yeah, it's a person.  Kathy Lueders: I think people see themselves as explorers. It was interesting to me, the social phenomena of anthropomorphizing Opportunity, right?   Host: Uh huh.  Kathy Lueders: I mean, my children came home from school, and my daughter was crying because Oppy died -- like, died. You know what I mean? It was, like, terms like that, right?  Host: You're talking about the Mars rover.  Kathy Lueders: Yeah, the Mars rover, like Oppy died. And I think it -- that shows that we see ourselves -- you know, it's not -- it's not -- we see ourselves on these other worlds, you know? I'm always amazed -- I used to read Isaac Asimov when I was growing up, and this concept that we've always seen that we are going to be other places. It may take us time to get to these other places, but we're not going to just stay here. And I think that's reflected with -- when we go send a rover out, we are finding a way to put eyes on that rover, and we're finding a way to make that rover us. And I think it's just this -- there's this inherent part of us that is about -- if we know of a place, how do we go see that place? And it's kind of what got people to get on a boat and go to a shore, and we actually, in some ways, have more knowledge than they did about the worlds that they were going to in some places, right? Now, the challenges we have are -- may seem to us way greater, and I'm sure at the time -- if you're -- I'm always amazed when you see those rickety boats, and you think, oh, my gosh. You got on that boat, and then headed out into the ocean? Like, that was crazy.  Host: That was state-of-the-art.  Kathy Lueders: Well, that -- but that was also crazy, right? And so -- so, I mean -- but there's probably some people that think, hey, you go get in a little tin can and go out in the netherworld, and that's crazy. But look at what came out of it, you know? I think sometimes we don't know what's going to come out of it. And -- but we do know what has come out of our exploration activities in the past, and we know that if we don't explore, we're not going to ever know.  Kirk Shireman: Part of being a human is seeing it through someone's eyes, and so it's -- today, it's -- the easy analogue is music, or art. You know, those things are part of the human condition. I think our lives are rich because of those things. We need humans, the ones who can go and describe it to those of us who didn't get to go. We need them to be there and describe it. So I think not only do we need them to be part of the system, we need them to be part of the experiment, but we need them to be able to bring the rest of humanity with them. And I really do think that, in the near-term, that's what human spaceflight is all about. Long-term, there's no question -- I think the species needs to be a multi-planet species. And so, for -- I believe, ultimately, for the survival of the species, we need to be able to live in other places. Now, that's probably not in the next 10 or 20 years, but I think that's the direction that the human species needs to go.  Host: You probably have your own reasons why you believe in putting the human in human spaceflight, and they very likely go beyond the Cold War political reasoning that was part of the calculus when President John Kennedy set the goal of landing Americans on the Moon in the 1960s. When I asked today's guests for their thoughts about why it was important to return people to the Moon, none of their answers had to do with political motives. They believe in making a practical use of the Moon, which is relatively close to Earth, to get ready for missions that will go thousands of times farther out into space.  John McCullough: Learning those 30, 60, 90-day missions around the Moon and on the surface allow you to use those resources, understand how to work in that environment. That's 1000 times further than the low Earth orbit missions on station that we do, 1000 times further -- hugely different problem. Well, Mars, the next step, is 2000 times further than the Moon.  Host: Two thousand times?  John McCullough: Two thousand times further than the Moon, and that is a whole -- you got to build those capabilities. It's a really good proving ground before you go to the next step, but you've got to take those steps. And you've got to take them before -- when the time allows you to get there, and get it done. Otherwise, you're not going to survive as a civilization.  Lara Kearney: So going -- so the ultimate goal is to get us to Mars, and then beyond, of course, but to get us to Mars. But going to Mars is really, really hard. Well, going to Mars and bringing someone back safely is really, really hard, and so the Moon really provides for us a way to practice, and learn the things we don't know already, right? And so, to go back to the Moon in a long-term sustainable way, learn how to live there for a period of time, learn how to, you know, live off of the resources on another planet, learn how to take care of the human body in an environment that it's not meant to be in. Being on the Moon for a sustained period of time will help us learn all those lessons while we're still relatively close to home, right, before we take that really big leap onto Mars.  Host: Two hundred fifty thousand miles is your definition of relatively close [laughter].  Lara Kearney: Relative to Mars, that's pretty close.  Holly Ridings: Yeah, so flying in low Earth orbit, right, which we've been doing for many years, you know, with the Space Station, and before that, with the shuttle, you know, teaches you a certain set of skills, right? How you communicate with people in orbit, how quickly you can get home if something goes wrong -- you know, once you get outside of low Earth orbit, go farther away from the earth, you know, to the Moon in this case -- you know, you have a different set of technical problems to solve. And if you're a flight director, and working operations, you think about in terms of risk. Okay, how long does it take to talk to someone? They're on the backside of the Moon. Can you talk to them at all? Something goes wrong -- can you get home? How often can you get home? How fast can you get home? And when you think about all of those challenges that we will get to solve, and then sort of move that thought forward even farther out, inside -- outside of low Earth orbit, past the Moon, and into the solar system, those challenges only get more complicated. And so, you have to transition to a system that can't rely on, you know, everything back home helping you out. You've got to have more autonomy with the way we look at flying in space, and so that's just sort of one example of how much we're going to learn by getting to the Moon and staying there.  Host: Let's keep in mind -- in today's NASA, under the Artemis program, the goal is not to just put people on the Moon, as we did two generations ago. The goal is to return American astronauts to the Moon by 2024, and establish a sustainable presence on the Moon by 2028. From there, astronauts can make scientific discoveries, demonstrate technological advancement, and lay foundations for private companies to build a lunar economy.  Lara Kearney: I think part of what the Artemis program will do for us, and the Gateway, is learn how to develop and fly reusable spacecraft architectures, right? You know, Apollo -- think of it as a point solution. They went to a specific destination, and they came back. The Gateway and the Artemis program will allow us -- I think of it more like an infrastructure. We build an infrastructure that allows multiple spacecraft to come and go. And how do we operate that infrastructure, and how do we reuse vehicles so that we're not disposing of them every time we want to fly a mission? And every -- the more we learn about that, the more we bring the costs down, the overall costs down, and when it becomes more affordable, we can start doing more. And when we can do more, we can go farther.  Host: Kirk Shireman's been working on the International Space Station program since the first component, the Zarya module, was still in a factory in Russia. So he knows something about creating a system that will support a vehicle in space, or an outpost off-world.  Kirk Shireman: Sustainable's a really hard thing. It's a really difficult thing.  Host: Ask the International Space Station.  Kirk Shireman: [Laughter] Yes, and the further away from home, the harder it is. It -- so even learning how to be sustainable in that sense is going to be difficult. Now, the Moon -- the Moon is a lot further away. In the International Space Station, you can be on the space station, and be home in a matter of, you know, three-ish hours. In fact, we did that here Monday night. So -- but if you're in the Moon, if you're at the Moon, certainly on the surface of the Moon, but even in the vicinity of the Moon, you might be nine days from coming home.   Host: Wow.  Kirk Shireman: And so, that's a big change. You know, three hours to nine days -- and so, even that, and keeping humans alive and safe in that environment I think is a great thing to learn. How you put things on the surface, and then how you hook up to those things, how you link up with those, and when you arrive there -- a lot of practicality. How do you build things with the resources that are present on the Moon was great, and that technology can be used here on the planet, so -- on Earth. So what we do out there, I think, will also have benefits back here. I think people are already working on building habitats with lunar soil, lunar regolith right now. If you can do that, you could do it here with the Earth. And so, I think there are benefits that we'll get back here, even from basic engineering things that we'll do on the Moon.  Host: And presumably, the -- what you've learned doing that on the Moon may be then applicable to doing it on other, further-away planets.  Kirk Shireman: Sure. You know, who knows? I hope so. I think when they talked about making rocket fuel out of the ice or the water that's there, we certainly think that's applicable in other places. There's, you know, moons around Jupiter that we believe have water ice, and so you can envision, in the future, doing the similar thing out there. So Mars has an atmosphere of carbon dioxide, which doesn't quite scratch all the itches for rocket fuel, but could be used to convert that carbon dioxide into useful things for a long-term human presence. So all this -- even this notion of using the resources that are present I think will definitely apply not only in the Moon, but as we take the human species further and further from home.  Kathy Lueders: You're establishing places where people can develop and actually potential use the capability that's there. It's not about visiting anymore. It's about staying. This may be a 100-year goal. It may be a 200-year goal, but it's in the same vein of -- if you're going to have a goal, it's about can -- is there ways to do it in a way that enables it to be able to expand the potential of the mission when you get up there. This is -- these are hard things.  Host: Yeah.  Kathy Lueders: These are hard things. They are not easy things. We don't have the answers to how you go do that, but in the same way, I think if we knew what the answers were today, then we're not making our hard goal to enable us to be able to push the learning. And really, that's, to me, the value. That's the value proposition. The value proposition is having a goal that's so hard we don't know how to do it yet. And through the figuring-out-how-to-do-it, that's when we're expanding human knowledge.  John McCullough: I think going and learning how to work there, and, again, figuring out how to use resources where you find them to propel you to the next milestone is what this is all about. If we can't live and work in space, there's only a finite amount of space and capability on this planet. And again, we need to protect this planet. We need to preserve it, and we need to push out and learn how to live in that -- what is the 99% of the rest of the space we have, right, is that type of environment. So we need to get to that environment, and understand, and live there.  Host: You've talked about the things we need to learn in order to provide for our own future, as well as supply future exploration. Can you give me a couple of concrete examples? What kinds of questions do we have about future space exploration that this sustainable presence on the Moon is going to help us answer, to get us ready to do those future things?  John McCullough: It varies significantly from the simple things that we do and take for granted every day in this environment -- and we've learned a lot about that on space station. But 1/6th gravity is different than zero gravity, and it's different than full gravity. And so, that environment, from a radiation and a thermal perspective, plus 200, minus 200 degrees, day and night, or shade and light, is a huge, huge challenge of environment to work in. And so, we have worked in that environment, but being able to work there in a way that you can't run home and get spares or supplies on a daily basis means you're -- so for example, our spacesuit design -- it's significantly more versatile, and significantly more flexible in terms of redundant systems and capabilities. So that when you're out there on your own, and you're roving, or you're further away from your vehicle, you have capabilities that allow you to get back safely. So managing how to operate safely, managing the risk, and learning how to accept the kind of risk that we have to take to get out there are huge challenges for us to face.  Holly Ridings: You can go camp in the mountains for a week. You have to have a certain set of stuff in your backpack. You're going to go build a cabin and stay there for three years. That's a very, very different -- different challenge, and I think that the world is really excited about taking on that challenge.  Steve Koerner: And you think about what's necessary -- what resources are necessary to launch that capsule with people in it into space. Well, we're not going to have that infrastructure on Mars, or we're not going to have that infrastructure on the Moon. So what's available that we can take advantage of to be able to do this effort in a way that's actually -- makes it the potential to be successful? And so, you know, you hear the administrator talk today about discoveries of water or ice on the Moon.  Host: Right.  Steve Koerner: And why we maybe should head to the South Pole of the Moon -- things like that. What are we going to find out when we get there that enable us to say, \"Ah, okay, here's what we can do with what we've uncovered.\"  Host: While the Artemis program is relatively new, it's clear that the men and women who lead NASA's human spaceflight effort have been thinking about putting people on the Moon again for quite some time. And it probably won't come as a surprise to you to learn some of the reasons they put stock in just such a future. Steve Koerner, the chief of the JSC flight operations directorate:  Steve Koerner: Looking back over my career, some of the most powerful things that I didn't even realize I was a part of as it was happening was that alignment around a common goal, the International Space Station. Human spaceflight's hard, and yet, numerous countries aligned around a common goal, and able -- were able to put that amazing machine in orbit. We put aside our differences, whether where we lived geographically, or our political persuasions, or whatever, because we were focused around a common goal, human spaceflight. Hugely powerful to look at what can be accomplished when your team, your company, your organization, your country, whatever, is aligned around a common goal, and to me, that's been the most satisfying piece of this job, is seeing -- being a part of a goal that I think is hugely significant, and watching -- watching the collective organizations, the entire team around that same goal be successful.  Host: Johnson Space Center director, Mark Geyer:  Mark Geyer: We talked a little bit about what motivated me when I was a kid, and I remember -- I remember that time. I remember the excitement, and the newness of going to space, and I remember how it affected the whole culture. You know, I had a Major Matt Mason toy, and I watched \"Star Trek.\" Right? It all started in about that same timeframe. So it kind of changed the whole vibe in that timeframe. So, NASA's done a lot of cool stuff in between that. The shuttle was incredible. The station is really a world wonder, and we're about to do more of that. But I do think going back to the Moon is such a significant step that I do believe it will amp -- it'll ramp up the attention, and the interest of the kids in this country. And if we can show them that they have a place in that future with these companies, or with NASA, and that we can continue to bring them along, and help make sure that they have the opportunities they need to get the education they need -- I mean, whether they end up at NASA, or Boeing, or SpaceX, or not, it doesn't matter. If they've -- if it motivated them to get through science, or even, you know, liberal arts and everything else, it gets them excited enough to get through their degree, and we have an educated workforce, that's better for everybody. And I do feel like Apollo helped, even if a lot of people didn't end up at NASA. I still think it helped our overall youth and the country in general.  Host: Chief Flight Director Holly Ridings is one who sees potential rewards that go beyond the engineering achievements that will come out of the Artemis program.  Holly Ridings: When I think about what we can learn -- you know, there's -- so there's the technical answer, right?   Host: Okay.  Holly Ridings: We can figure out how to, you know, build spacecraft, and land on the Moon, and stay there, but I'd say that I'm more excited about what we can learn as people, right? You know, how to bring hope, and energy, and excitement to the world, you know, something that everyone looks at, and wants to be a part of, and believes in.  Host: Last word today to International Space Station Program Manager Kirk Shireman:  Kirk Shireman: The thing is, going to the Moon is a really, really difficult thing, and people remember it now. People my age certainly remember it, but people that are younger, which is, you know, most of the population of the world, haven't ever seen that. And I think that will be really cool. One of the great things that I didn't notice when I was six years old, but as I have been on the International Space Station program, had a chance to travel around the world. And people all over the world know NASA and remember that event, and in fact, I see pictures of people from all -- different countries all over the world stopping to watch that first step. And I think that's something really, really cool. It's something that brings the whole together, when a human being steps foot on another body, and that's something I think the world really needs, something to bring it together. There's so many things today that drive us all apart. Wouldn't it be great to have something like that, that would bring the whole world together? So I'm really looking forward to going back to the Moon. I think it'll be great for NASA. I think it'll be great for the United States, but it'll be a great thing for the whole planet.  [ Music ]  Host: Well, that was fun, talking with these men and women who lead human spaceflight at NASA today. Hearing their memories of Apollo 11, and getting some insight into how that historic first moon landing 50 years ago is connected through the space shuttle program right into today's efforts with the International Space Station and Commercial Crew and cargo programs. Into the development of the programs that will help give life to the Artemis program, the Orion vehicle, the Space Launch System rocket, and the Gateway. I hope you enjoyed listening.

                        "description": "Dan Huot (Host): Houston, we have a podcast. Welcome to the official podcast of the NASA Johnson Space Center. Episode 108, “The Boeing Starliner.” I'm Dan Huot and I'll be your host today. On this podcast, we bring in the experts, NASA scientists, engineers, astronauts and leaders to tell you all the coolest parts about NASA. We're close to launching astronauts from American soil with two different vehicles developed by two different companies. Boeing and SpaceX. It's all part of the commercial crew program designed to enable the capability of launching people into space by private businesses. Today we're going to highlight one of those vehicles; the Boeing Starliner. In the studio, we brought in Tony Castilleja and Celena Dopart. Tony and Celena are engineers with Boeing responsible for getting the spacecraft and the crew ready for these first missions. We talk about the vehicle itself, all of testing and all the training happening and what we're going to be looking forward to in the very near future. So with no further delay, let's go light speed and jump right ahead to our talk with Tony and Celena. Enjoy.   [Music]   Host: All right. I have Tony and Celena from Boeing with me today. Thank you guys so much for taking a little bit of your day to join me today. This is an exciting time. We got a new spacecraft coming, right?  Tony Castilleja: Oh, absolutely. It's the best time to work in aerospace. We're happy to be here. We're training our astronauts today. Excited to be here today.  Celena Dopart: Very excited to make time for this.  Host: All right. So we're here to talk about the Starliner. The CST100 Starliner. So first off, paint me a word picture. What does this thing look like? If you needed to describe this to somebody like, this is what you're going to see, how would you do that?  Tony Castilleja: We're building a spaceship. We're building a spaceship today for the next generation of human spaceflight. Since the end of the space shuttle, NASA has contracted with Boeing to build the Boeing Starliner. It's a capsule design that will launch up to five astronauts in its initial configurations to the International Space Station and all though it looks like a capsule that most Americans and most people around the world have looked at for generations, it's a next generation spacecraft for a next generation mission.  Celena Dopart: And some of the differences between for example, our vehicle and Apollo say, it's a little bit bigger. We've got a little bit more room. If you look at it and if you've seen, Orion, if you've seen Apollo, you kind of get the idea of what a capsule looks like. Our vehicle is similar but it's got some unique differences. So, if we go in the interior of our vehicle, it's more spacious. It's certainly not, let's say glamping. It's more camping. There's --  Host: Still tight space. Still spaceflight, it's still tight quarters but --  Celena Dopart: Still tight quarters for sure. And when we get up to four crew members and it, it's definitely shared space. But there's enough room for them to do all the activities that they have to do and we've got all the support that's needed on the interior to help them get station.  Host: So something I've heard several times and we've heard this with the Orion spacecraft and I'm sure you hear you guys here this with the Starliner is it's that capsule shape. It's that really iconic kind of triangular shape. Why do somebody's spacecraft look like that?  Tony Castilleja: It's physics. It goes back to the aerodynamics and the fundamentals of aerodynamics to provide the most efficient design. The best return L over D or lift over drag as you come back to the atmosphere. In this case, for our spacecraft for a land landing will be one of the first human rated formidable space vehicles to be able to do that. And so when we looked at the math and science and the physics of flight, that capsule design created the most economical, the safest, and the most reusable capability for our engineers to get ready for that flight.  Celena Dopart: And you look at the design of spacecraft in the past, there's really two kinds. There's space planes and then there's space capsules. And so it was always going to be one of those two. If it ain't broke don't fix it. Just make it better and that's what we've done with the capsule design we have.  Host: So let's get into the better. What some of the, I mean, technology's, so far since Apollo and everything. What are some of the cool new gadgets? What are some of the nice things if they're glamping? You know, there's not like a 60\" TV in there. But you know, what are some of the nicer things that the astronauts are going to have access to on these new missions?  Celena Dopart: So one of the biggest differences is pretty striking when you first go into our vehicle if you're familiar with the space shuttle or Apollo. There's a lot less inside in terms of switches and buttons and controls. I know there are shuttle cockpit mockups on-site so if any of our listeners have ever seen them on site, there are switches and buttons on every surface within reach of the commander and the pilot.  Host: Which like 12-year-old me inside of those would have been so -- like there's buttons everywhere buttons, buttons, buttons and switches. Like they're so satisfying.  Celena Dopart: I know. It is fun to play with. It's fun to play with. It's a lot harder to control when there's that many things to interact with. So, with the technology that's come a really long way we've been able to simplify that a lot. So, I don't know the numbers exactly but we have greatly reduced the number of buttons and switches that a crew has to interact with. We still have displays that give a lot of information. All the information necessary for a crewmember to make informed decisions and know what's going on in their mission. But, there's a lot less for them to have to do and have to do in an emergency or contingency situation. So we really streamlined operations and that's one of the big differences.  Tony Castilleja: And as you look and you walk inside to our Boeing mockup trainer which is actually here at Johnson space Center, if you ever come by Building 9, you'll see our Boeing trainer there. You walk in and it's a much cleaner design if you will and it allows for more cargo capability as well as the crew capability to space station. And that miniaturization of technology that we've experienced since last time. You know we built the space capsule. But also we've integrated the capability in our new spacesuit to be able to start interacting with touchscreens and so we'll have tablets that our astronauts can use for electronic flight logs on their mission. And so you're starting to see that capability start to continue to make progress in these brand-new space vehicles. And so we want to make sure it's right in and it's safe for our astronauts in terms of tactile feedback in terms of the switches that we have in the vehicle which are optimized to go from autonomy to human driving if you will. And then back to autonomy. But then give the ability to continue to bring that innovation to the forefront.  Host: So you mentioned cargo. Let's just kind of get into this stuff real quick. So how much stuff is this capsule going to be bringing? I mean including the people and the cargo because it sounds like there's going to be room for both.  Celena Dopart: Yep. Absolutely. So all of this is defined by the NASA requirements that they give us. So SpaceX is designing to the same requirements that we are and so if you're interested in the specifics, you can look at the 1130 requirements which are just available online. But our volumetric, what we have to carry in terms of cargo for NASA, is defined by that. I don't know the number of the top of my head. But we also have to have the capability to carry zero to four crew members. So going back to what Tony was saying about autonomous versus not autonomous, we have to have the capability to fly zero people on our capsule and our first test flight is un-crewed so we really have to demonstrate that. But then we also have to be able to carry four crew members. So that's going to be sort of the nominal mission once we get operational. We plan to carry four crew members and a full complement of cargo. So that's where I go back to, it's kind of camping. There is not a ton of space for hanging out and having fun. We don't have the 60\" TV screen. But, there are windows in the vehicle and while we're waiting to get to station, there's plenty of things that they'll be doing to take up their time.  Host: So what else is kind of inside the capsules? I'm assuming there's some seats. There's some buttons, not as many buttons as there used to be but there's some buttons, some screens. What are some of kind of the other accoutrements, the other facilities for the crew members inside?  Tony Castilleja: Yes. So as you walk in the spacecraft you'll see the ability for us to land in water in case of an anomalous scenario. But we're baseline land so you'll see the life raft in there as you come in. You'll see a row of three seats on the top row with the furthest most seat as you walk into the spacecraft as if you were on the launch pad being the main commander and pilot of the vehicle. And as you look over to the right, you'll see two seats on the lower row if you will, kind of in between seat one and two and then in between seat two and seat three on that top row. So you get kind of this you know, almost like a dice view from the top in terms of the five crew.  Host: Kind of staggered.  Tony Castilleja: Kind of staggered. And it goes back to CG. It goes back to basic you know, aerospace; basic physics.  Host: CG?  Tony Castilleja: Center of gravity. Center of mass. So to all those up and comers, it goes back to the basic aerospace and physics. And so --  Celena Dopart: Let me jump in for second. You said five crew members and we just talked about four. So we do have a fifth seat which we don't plan to utilize for our nominal NASA missions. That fifth seat will be swapped out to be able to carry a little more cargo with a cargo pallet. But Tony is absolutely right. We could if we ever have the desire or another customer, take five crew members at a time.  Tony Castilleja: Exactly. So as you walk in you'll see this white walls if you will, and the cargo on the left and right of you on each side. And when you think about where we put the switches and dials, it's all about sitting in the pilot seat and imagining yourself -- the amount of time you need to go reach a dial. Pretend that you are in your car, your Lexis, your Audi and you've got to move this seat in order to reach a certain button or dial. We did that with the seat and the reach and visibility of where the switches are. So the most important ones, caution and warning panels, things of that sort are very close to where your line of sight is. And then something like the temperature of your cabin is off to the left. And so where we put the switches and where we put the dials are really focused on the crew member for those safety scenarios in case of the autonomy takeover of the human. But again, less number of switches. The console's in front of seat one and seat two on that top row. Seat three, four, and five, you have a lot more if you say looking around room if you will in our spacecraft.  Host: It’s -- just real quick -- it's kind of crazy. You don't always think about the level of detail that goes into design for these kind of things. But even something as simple as that like, which makes perfect sense when you hear it, yeah. The switches, the indicators that there's an emergency should be really close to right out front and the less important stuff off to the side. I almost feel like has that level of detail gone into everything when you're designing this kind of stuff?  Celena Dopart: Yeah, so especially for what Tony is talking about right now with the displays on the console and where things are laid out. It all comes down to good systems integration and human factors engineering. So I'm giving my plug for that because I'm a human factors engineer. But it really is -- besides designing the systems and really strong, solid, robust systems, you need to make sure that they are designed for the end-user and our end-user is an astronaut. And we need to take into account all the other crew accommodations that go into the equation. The suits and the restraints that might prevent them from reaching something while they're strapped in a high G phase of flight or when they're on orbit. How do we have the accommodations to set up and let them have a little extra room to move around? So, there are some really creative engineering solutions we've come up with on our program. So our seats are sort of reconfigurable for the different sizes of crew members. We have to be able to take a whole range of anthropometric dimensions of crew members. So anywhere from 5th percentile female to 95th percentile male, everything needs to accommodate all of that range of crew members. So it's a really challenging problem. But I wish this were visual so we could show you how we've done some of these things. But, it's a really cool problem to be a part of the solution.  Tony Castilleja: Yeah. And for me as an engineer having built these trainers from the beginning, I mean, it's almost like looking at a blank canvas and putting the right switches in the right places and having discussion with every single engineer, every single subsystem, every single expert, avionics, environmental control system, abort systems and scenarios, trajectory folks and being able to optimize all of that into this final painting that is the interior of our spacecraft.   Celena Dopart: Yeah --  Tony Castilleja: And that's where we get to geek out.  Celena Dopart: And I will say it wasn't easy and I'm sure every subsystem is annoyed that this one switch didn't make it onto the final console. And so it really is a true systems approach where you have to get feedback and put buy-in from every single team who's a part of it to ultimately come up with this final design that's there.  Tony Castilleja: And I'll tell you. If we've done it right which our team has validated every single as we go to, get ready to get on the launch pad, you're only going to stare at that beautiful painting of a canvas. You're there just for the ride.  Celena Dopart: Yeah. Hopefully you won't really have to touch much. You'll interact with the displays but it should be as smooth, pretty boring ride if we've done our job correctly.  Host: I feel like no right into space would ever be boring. But I appreciate that. Yeah. So if everything goes right, like you just kind of, you're sitting back for the ride. If the spacecraft --  Celena Dopart: You're making sure.  Host: -- can fly with zero people like, the experience would be the same with four people.  Celena Dopart: Exactly. Exactly. You, the, when the crewmembers are on board, they're primarily to respond to an anomalous situation. So for our nominal missions, which we hope every single one is a nominal mission and we expect them to be, the crewmembers will have to do a few things. But for the most part, everything can be done by ground that they have to do nominally. And everything else that the crew needs to do on a crewed flight is to support the crew. So, for example hygiene. There are certain things that the crewmember has to do on board to deal with hygiene situations, to food and water, the seatbelts, that sort of stuff. The crew has to interact with and so we need to make sure the crew can do it. But the ground can't do it because the ground doesn't need to do it. So when the crew is on board, there are certain things that have to happen that don't have to happen on an un-crewed mission but we've made sure to design all those things so that the crew can do it themselves.  Host: So you talked about -- you know it's ultimately designed for that in the user, an astronaut basically. How much are they involved in the process because we've announced the first crewmembers who are going to be flying on here. There's some NASA astronauts. There's also a Boeing astronaut who used to be a NASA astronaut, commanded the last shuttle mission, Chris Ferguson. How much are they kind of in the mix and also being a voice? So you've got all those subsystems you know, arguing for what's the most important thing. How important is the astronaut voice in all of this?  Tony Castilleja: Their experience when we hired former astronaut, NASA astronaut, Chris Ferguson over to Boeing has been tremendous. Not only in the design of the vehicle but to Celena and I as engineers and as individuals getting to build this spaceship. They were a part of every single meeting, giving their experience of riding on the space shuttle and other members of the astronaut corps to the NASA commercial crew cadre earlier in the program that gave us feedback along the way. At the end of the day our customers are NASA astronaut and getting their opinions and insight were instrumental and for us as engineers to get to work with folks who have flown on a variety of space vehicles has been truly the best part of this job.  Celena Dopart: And being right down the street from Johnson Space Center at the Boeing building that's here in Houston has made it really easy to collaborate with the astronauts. So the original commercial crew cadre, the four of them who were announced a few years ago, like Tony said, they've been integral in pretty much every design meeting, decision, evaluation that we've done. And now that they've been assigned to specific crew members, to specific missions and we've gotten the additional crew members, those five who have been announced for our CFT and PCM1 missions, I see them on a weekly basis. We're doing verification testing that they're a part of. Our design is 99% done but there are still a few tweaks that are being done and the crew is a huge part of that. So, of course the NASA stack holders, the NASA engineers and SMEs, subject matter experts, but it's really the end-user, the astronaut. We want to make sure that we meet all the requirements but also build a space craft that they want to fly on and feel comfortable flying on.  Host: Well now we're kind of at the fun part though right? Like, it's all being built but they're also training. So how involved are you guys with the training?  Celena Dopart: Training has started already. They are training. I mentioned verification testing. That is partially doubling as some of their training. They're getting really familiar with the systems both off-console systems and the Boeing mockup trainer in Building 9 and the on-console systems in our Boeing engineering simulator and Boeing mission simulator, both at Boeing in building five here at JSC on-site. So, Boeing is kind of interesting, the way we're doing mission operations including training. We are contracting NASA to do some of our mission operations for us. There is just a wealth of experience that they have here. So, NASA FOD is helping out with our training and our mission operations. So that training has started. They're using the Boeing mockup trainer over in Building 9 to do that training.  Tony Castilleja: Yeah and when you look at the overall time frames for overall training, these vehicles, the Boeing Starliner with its simplified approach, with its more autonomy, we're going through every scenario in these training systems. But overall, the big focus is space station. So the last time you can train on our Starliner because of the simplicity of systems and the amount of innovation we’ve put in and the autonomy that allows for more focus on that space station training and really expands the aperture of the amount of science that we're doing on space station and that's what it's all about beginning with our astronauts. And of course, ending with the great innovations and insights we're learning from living and working in space.  Host: So what are some of kind of like the trainers that they're getting their hands on? Because I remember like back during shuttle, we had one that would go up and it was motion based and you could fly. It was almost like a video game. It was the greatest thing in the world and I'm still so sad that we don't have it any more. But like what are some of different trainers that they're working on? What different functions do they serve?  Tony Castilleja: A day in the life of Boeing training starts at the Boeing mockup trainer, getting familiarized with the overall volumetric and human in the loop systems that you'll be in. So as we described earlier, walking the space craft. Where is every switch? Where is every dial? What are all the switches behind you in the full scale trainer? You basically put yourself in a mindset of you're on the launch pad at space launch complex 41 on the Atlas 5 rocket. You're walking the space craft. What does it look like? We also go through a land landing scenario and even an off-nominal land landing scenario where you're on the ground after a land landing and how do you get out through the top of the vehicle in a secondary approach if you will; an off-nominal approach for a land landing. So that gives you an overall physical environment understanding of the vehicle and the team has been tremendous in training both on the NASA side and the Boeing side to get that physical familiarization. And then we have our other trainer of the software perspective.  Celena Dopart: Yeah, so the Boeing mockup trainer is our physical geometric, volumetric, show where everything is. We have a couple simulations where they actually learn to fly the vehicle and interact with the subsystem via the displays. So we've got the Boeing engineering simulator which is a quarter cockpit. So it's got the commander and pilot and the mission specialist one seats and all of the console displays and switches. That's at the Boeing building here in Houston. We have a very similar but slightly higher fidelity mission mockup environment in building 5 here at JSC. It's called the Boeing mission simulator and that's very similar to the best in that you interact with the displays. You fly simulations but you're more enclosed in the capsule so it feels a little more like an actual mission would.  Host: But they're getting like simulated pictures and stuff like that.  Celena Dopart: Yep so actually both of those run off of real flight software and are driven by engineering models that are really high fidelity to model and simulate the ECLS for example; Environmental Control and Life Support. As well as the EPS; the Electrical Power System. All of those systems are simulated and then it interacts with the flight software to give a very realistic mission for the crew members to train.  Tony Castilleja: And you can't beat the view out the window; a 4K rendition back on Earth as you go and do your mission and put approach space station.  Celena Dopart: Yeah.  Host: Well that -- yeah.  Celena Dopart: And there are a few more. We've got tons of trainers. Of course that's a focus for any space mission right? The astronauts need to find ways to train here on the ground and so we also have a few part test trainers which are another way for them to interact with the simulation and the flight software. But they're more virtual cockpit so it's touchscreen. It's not quite as tactile as the BES and BMS but they still get practice with the flight software. And then of course there's the training for the ground team. So, we're going to have mission control here at JSC and we're doing full up simulations with people in the BMT, the Boeing Mockup Trainer, the physical one doing tasks there. People in the BMS, flying an actual vehicle with people on the ground over the loops talking through a real mission scenario. So we kind of -- unfortunately we don't have one big iron horse where we can do everything all at once. But we piece it together here on site and can simulate every single part of a real mission.  Tony Castilleja: And that's what training is such that when you're on the launch pad nothing is a surprise in terms of how we've trained our astronauts to get ready to fly.  Host: And so you're covering every imaginable scenario.  Tony Castilleja: Everything. And the really great thing about being in Houston here at Johnson Space Center is that the Boeing Mockup Trainer, the Boeing Engineering Simulator, the Boeing Motion Simulator over in building five are all co-located. So where an astronaut can go from Boeing Starliner training over to their mission and expedition training, they're on the space station mockups as well.  Celena Dopart: And I will say, we don't know what we don't know. So I'm sure there are scenarios that they will encounter that we haven't trained. But the whole point of training is to train a representative set of scenarios that gives them the knowledge and the training to be able to respond to scenarios that we may not have covered in specific detail here as how you respond exactly. But they should have the subsystem knowledge, the full system knowledge and the knowledge of how to interact with the vehicle to be able to respond to anything that might arise.  Host: All right. So clearly a lot of work goes into getting the people whether they're flying on the vehicle or controlling it from here ready. But I imagine just as much if not more, goes into getting the vehicle ready. So after you're done designing, doing all that stuff probably the most fun stuff again is the testing. Like what does it take? This is a brand-new spacecraft. What does it take to go from the drawing board to putting that thing on top of a rocket and putting people in it?  Tony Castilleja: Oh, it's been just a journey from day one and it always starts off with what we call subcomponent testing. So let's say in our vehicle has solar rays and batteries for power systems. Well, how does the battery work? Can you test the battery in the space environment in a vacuum chamber and get all that data? Okay, well now the batteries done. Well how does that connect over to the circuit board and how does that work? How does that work when it's connected over to the console? Okay, well how does the Council then connect to the structure? And how was the primary structure react to the skeleton of Starliner.  Host: It's like 10 million links in the chain.  Tony Castilleja: Yeah. Bottom line, it's subsystem to integrated testing and NASA is working with us every single day shoulder to shoulder. And what we get to do is present our design test in the environment of the initial conditions and the box if you will of the environments that we're going to experience in space and during our missions and NASA's right there with us, you know, giving us an A+. Or if there's lessons learned, we learn and we get back there on the testing floor and all of that, all of those checklists, all of those verifications come together toward our final flight readiness review which I used to do on space shuttle and we look around the room. We look at every subsystem and every engineer and say are we go for flight? And that's that final grade report to ensure that safety for mission and crew.  Host: So you have all those different subsystems. Have you guys been part of any particular memorable task? Was there any system that you worked with when you know, you get that A+ afterwards? And you’re like, oh man thank you because I've spent the last like three months of nights working and obsessing over that system. And like how rewarding is it to kind of finally see that kind of -- that link in the chain get locked in and then you can move onto the next one?  Tony Castilleja: Yeah, it's the ultimate final exam.  Celena Dopart: Yeah. And multiple times right? So you go through one test. You finish it. You wrap it up with a bow and then you move onto the next one and they all build on top of each other. So, some of the tests that I've been involved in and are still ongoing are the integrated systems verification testing. So there's so many different parts of that. It's basically; it is part of that final exam. But there are so many parts. For example, we were down at KSC, Kennedy Space Center, where our launch complex is, doing emergency pad egress testing. So we did that recently which is pretty fun. You get to go from the top of the pad down to the ground in a matter of seconds testing those parts of the system.  Host: How did they get down?  Celena Dopart: How do they get down? We've got sort of slide wire system. It's not the basket system that they used in shuttle but it's a kind of -- you can think of it sort of like a zipline. Emergency use only. Not for fun but it is pretty fun when it's not an emergency. So we use that to get down but then we also, like I said, its integrated systems. So we get down to the ground and then have the big MRAP armored vehicles that take the astronauts and the ground crew out of the blast danger zone. So we've got all of those piece parts together and we test to make sure that the operations and the systems work together to actually meet the requirements that we need to. And so that's prelaunch emergencies. We also do post landing. Tony mentioned that we do egress scenarios in the Boeing mockup trainer in Building 9. We've also done a couple post landing scenarios out in the desert at one of our landing sites. So we didn't have a real vehicle landing of course but all the teams that are part of the recovery operations were out there in our ATVs waiting to go to, go recover astronauts and the vehicle. So we’ve done all that testing and there are still more that will burn down as we get closer and closer to launch. But each of those pieces is that so we are sure that our vehicle and the operations that we've designed around our vehicle and the systems work together the way that we expect and so nothing is a surprise on the day of launch or the day of landing just like Tony said.  Tony Castilleja: It's a team sport and you know, my biggest or there's about three of us that call the Boeing mockup trainer our baby and it's because you know we spent very long nights ensuring that every part of the vehicle is to the right fidelity to what the astronauts need for use. For us, it's not also about verification, making sure the checklist is done, it's I'm thinking about the astronaut and their feeling and passion as they go into that vehicle. The understanding of how safe they're going to feel in that vehicle. And so for us is not also you know, checking the box, it's also getting it right and that's that passion that we have. Whether it's the day before Christmas or the day before New Year. Because we need this capability. We need it now. And to be able to be a part of that and be able to be a part of history and you know yeah, the checklist is the checklist. But to look back, which you don't get to do very often at this amazing sprint to the launch pad and say, we built a living monument in Building 9. We built these simulators. We're out in the desert and at the launch pad. It's the best time to do what we do right now which is build a spaceship.  Celena Dopart: And you know what you said about checking the boxes versus making sure –  Tony Castilleja: Yeah.  Celena Dopart: -- the astronauts love it and are passionate about it and can use it? It reminds me of my grad school systems engineering class. My professor would be so proud that I remember this. But the difference between verification and validation; verification is making sure that you meet the requirements that are set out. Validation is making sure that those requirements were the right ones to meet. That they actually do what we need it to do for the end-user and the full system. So that's what we're doing, right? We're checking the boxes as we go along and do these tests but ultimately, we're getting down the road to validation to make sure that hey, this thing actually works the way we need to.  Tony Castilleja: And my favorite when we were building the mockup trainer is that Celena was basically my customer. And so it was verification, validation, and then staring at Celena saying are you okay with this? So, you know, it's also you know, a people perspective of how we get it done.  Host: All right. So all of this work is going into it and all this ultimately gets us to the mission. So walk us through the mission. We're there. We're on the pad. What unfolds?  Tony Castilleja: Right. So, we will be launching on the Atlas V rocket. So imagine yourself at Kennedy space Center. Our astronauts will actually be suiting up in the same rooms from the shuttle era, right?  Celena Dopart: I believe so.  Host: Yep.  Tony Castilleja: So you're going to see elements of the past and the future all at the same time. We'll roll out to Space Launch Complex 41. A huge hats off to United Launch Alliance. They built the crew access tower in the middle of an amazing rocket manifest to their other customers. And so they'll go up onto the crew access tower to the Starliner which will not have a faring. It will be the capsule on top of the Atlas V vehicle. You'll see it on the pad and they'll go into the CST 100 Starliner very similar to Building 9 training. You'll see those five seats in there for the first flight. There will be three crew members and a complement of cargo and in the future they'll be those four crewmembers including a fifth paying passenger, right? And so, that will be the look and feel that you'll see on the launch pad. You'll see our NASA Mission Control Center that we've hired. Their tremendous expertise going through their final checklist again very similar to shuttle with the crew on the pad. The vehicle will be you know, smoky and with all the fuel and all the power you need to launch. We'll do our final countdowns. People like Celena and our engineers, are going to be a part of that pole and is going to be go for flight. A typical mission will take about six hours to the International Space Station. So we talked about camping. It's basically a long road trip. Going over to the International Space Station for autonomous flight the entire way of the journey. The astronaut can take over just in case to do a docking with the NASA docking system and the international docking adapter. Pressure checks on each side. Over the door and start your expedition mission. And then when you come back after your mission, you'll get back into the Starliner. You'll come back. About a six /six and a half hour flight if you will back down to earth to one of five landing locations in the western United States. As Celena mentioned earlier, White Sands has a tremendous history with NASA and we're leveraging that capability in that landing location. Six landing airbags on the bottom of the spacecraft are revealed as you come back through the atmosphere after the heat shield is removed for a nice soft landing in spacecraft terms.  Celena Dopart: Parachutes to help with that.  Host: Parachutes too. Yeah.  Tony Castilleja: In the western United States. And the team on the ground accesses the crew capsule with as variety of ground safety and equipment to be able to open the side hatch. The same door you came in when you were on the launch pad and shake hands with those astronauts. Get them back and get them back to Johnson Space Center.  Host: Sounds pretty quick and clean.  Tony Castilleja: Quick and clean is what we want and we train for every scenario. But I'll tell you, it's a testament to an amazing team.  Host: Yeah. Have you guys been to any of the landing sites yet?  Celena Dopart: I have. I mentioned the recovery testing that we've done. We did that out a White Sands.  Host: That's where I met you. Okay.  Celena Dopart: Oh is that --  Host: I was like yeah.  Celena Dopart: Okay.  Host: I remember. It was very hot.  Tony Castilleja: It’s a small world in aerospace.  Celena Dopart: Yeah. We were probably dirty and wearing dingier clothes than we are now so. But yeah. So I was part of the White Sands recovery team during that ISBIT test. And I know parts of the team have been out to some of our other sites to do site certifications to make sure they're ready for our landings.  Host: So what did you think of the White Sands? For me it was almost like we we're walking on the moon but really hot.  Celena Dopart: Yeah. It's so cool how different, different parts of our country is. And to be able to leverage that sort of environment just flat and hard as far as the eye can see. It's really cool that we have that right here and we can, we can utilize that. And that was, so we were on one of the old shuttle runways which is so cool to see. Just the vast expanse and for our landing, since it's not a space plane, we don't need to have a runway to land. It's really basically a four kilometer target if you will. And so the way we we've chosen our landing sites is to make sure that there's a four kilometer target of not much there, no dangers around so we're not posing hazard to nearby cities or anything like that or other operations.  Host: Not landing in somebody's backyard.  Celena Dopart: Exactly. So, it's just cool to be there. And that was one of the first times where I really felt, this is happening. This is really real. I know the capsule that we were working with was basically a bouncy house. So that was the only thing that didn't feel real but everything else. Everybody was so serious, so committed. So sure that we -- this is how we need to ensure, verify, validate everything that we're doing is here when we get an opportunity to come to one of our landing sites with the whole team and see how it will work on the real day.  Host: All right. Well, so all this testing's coming up. What kind of the big stuff coming up for Starliner? I know there's some test flights coming up and then you'll be operational. What's the really big stuff on the agenda coming up?  Tony Castilleja: We'll be launching an uncrewed test vehicle as Celena has mentioned. Testing all the autonomous systems. Autonomous rendezvous and docking with our mission control centers in all of our engineers. The final integration with our Atlas V rocket. And then after that, once we get into all the flight checks and all the flight readiness reviews out of that crewed test flight --  Celena Dopart: Uncrewed.  Tony Castilleja: -- uncrewed test flight and we'll get all those checks down the line. That data is king. And that will verify the safety of our vehicle from our design and our verifications on the ground and that will get us ready for first flight with crewed astronauts with Boeing astronaut Chris Ferguson and our two NASA crew members. And what that does is ensures our safety of our crew which is our number one priority.  Host: It's kind of like a big dress rehearsal almost.  Celena Dopart: Yeah. And I will say both of those flights OFT, or Orbital Flight Test, and CFT, our Crewed Flight Test. Both of those are still part of our validation efforts. So we will not -- PCM1 is our first certified operational mission. So until that flight, we're still in the test phase which is really kind of cool to be operationally testing. It's such an exciting time to be on the program. Looking forward next year to those two flights. And shortly thereafter PCM1.  Host: And then once -- so PCM, what does PCM stand for?  [Silence]  Host: Oh sorry.  Celena Dopart: What does it stand for?  [Laughter]  Tony Castilleja: Oh Post Certification Mission. Yeah, sorry.  Celena Dopart: Yeah.  Tony Castilleja: So many acronyms, so little time.  Celena Dopart: I said the whole thing without actually saying it. [Laughter] It's after certification. Yeah.  Host: So that's when you're just flying crew members to the station for a regular mission?  Celena Dopart: Yeah so at that point, we're really, NASA's our customer, our paying customer and we'll be flying NASA astronauts to and from the International Space Station. So before then our OFT and CFT is still validating and certifying our design.  Tony Castilleja: And well, that's where the beginning of commercial space flight begins. If you look at what Boeing Starliner is and NASA Commercial Crew Program, NASA's purchased tickets on every single vehicle at a flight rate of two flights per year. But as we mentioned earlier four, five astronaut crew members, that fifth paying passenger, fifth crew seat opportunity is available as we get into the later PCM flights or Post Certification Mission flights. And we go forward, you're going to start seeing new international partners, international partnerships based on the great work we've done on space station and new people flying and going to space and conducting experiments in microgravity that will be a benefit, not just to NASA and the International Space Station, but to countries and people of the world. And that is truly the most exciting part. Is that we are creating the foundation for a new low-Earth orbit space economy and how cool is it that Boeing, a hundred years after building an aircraft and now connecting people around the world, is going to explore space and open that up to so many more future Boeing astronauts.  Celena Dopart: And so if the person who won Mega Millions is listening, there's that fifth seat available.  Host: I was going to say, hearing that fifth seat, would you guys be up for taking the seat?  Celena Dopart: 100%.  Tony Castilleja: The amount of stuff and things we've learned with the Boeing mockup trainer and just building it, absolutely. Yeah and when you go into and you talk to every engineer and you get to know all of the intricacies of the system. Heck yeah. I would be on that flight. We are so committed to what we're doing. I'd be on that flight.  Celena Dopart: Yeah. And I, I don't know about Tony, but I've wanted to be an astronaut since I was really little. So that's why I'm in this industry. That's why I love my job. Working with them is the next best thing. But one day, I really do hope to fly on this vehicle that we're building right now.  Host: All right. Well, this has been amazing. Before I let you leave, like, what's the one thing you want to see more than anything coming up? Like what the one thing that's got you most excited, whether it's a launch, a landing, just seeing that first view of it in space? What are you --  Celena Dopart: Yes. All of it.  Host: Just all of it? Just say all of it?  Celena Dopart: I just -- yeah. Just working on this program for the past two years and seeing us get closer and closer and closer. I just can't wait to see it all come together. Each of these tests, those midterm exams that we were talking about, has brought us a little closer and felt more and more like the real thing. But I can't even imagine what it's going to feel like to be out at the launch pad on the launch day or out at the landing site on the landing day. I can't wait to see Chris launch and come back. He is the person who hired me on so I've worked really closely with him for these past three and a half years at Boeing. And it's just, I can't imagine a cooler scenario then being part of the mission and having worked so closely with the people onboard. I just can't wait for it to actually happen.  Tony Castilleja: Yeah. I mean my spark into human spaceflight started by seeing a space shuttle mission on a family vacation when I was 12. To work as an intern at Boeing on the space shuttle program and then full time. Be in mission control when STS 135 landed and hearing Chris's voice. To be there when we were in the throes of the opportunity to build Starliner and having someone like Chris walk in and shake my hand and say hey, I'm now a part of your team. To building living monuments of trainers and to work with this world-class team with people who are truly living history. When we're on the launch pad emotions will be many. But more importantly when we land, and we tell the nation and really the world that NASA has always been here. NASA continues to inspire and this is just one great giant leap forward into this new space economy. Boy, to be able to be a part of that and say we helped build this. We built this here, is just the best feeling in the world. And I can't wait for everyone listening to be able to be in Florida, see it on TV, see it around the world and to spot the Starliner in space. It might inspire you to come join us.  Host: All right. Well, Selena, Tony I'm going to let you get back to the midterms. I know you're excited to graduate. I can't wait to see more from Starliner. Thanks for spending a little bit of time and showing, telling us all what's going on and what there is to look forward to. I really appreciate it.  Tony Castilleja: We'll see you on the launch pad.  Celena Dopart: Thanks so much for having us.   [Music]  Host: Another big thanks to Tony and Celena for coming on the show today.

                        "description": "Pat Ryan (Host): Houston, we have a podcast. Welcome to the official podcast of the NASA Johnson Space Center. Episode 109, “Women of JSC: Apollo to Artemis.” I'm Pat Ryan. And I'm joined in introducing today's podcast by Jessica Vos, a name and voice that long-time listeners may recall. Jessica is an Orion spacecraft crew systems engineer who talked with Gary Jordan back on Episode 28 about how the new Orion spaceship is designed to accommodate its human crew members for missions into deep space. She's also the current chair of the Women Excelling in Life and Leadership Employee Resource Group. More commonly known here on site at JSC at WELL. Jessica, welcome back.  Jessica Vos: Thank you so much for having me. I'm excited to be here in this different capacity this time.  Host: All right, let's set the stage. Because I want people to understand what is WELL, your organization? What does it do here at JSC?  Jessica Vos: Absolutely. So at JSC we are really lucky in that our leadership truly believes that employees are our greatest asset. Mainly because of the fact that their diverse experiences backgrounds and skills that they each bring to work every day are truly what make us competitive and successful. Especially in this type of industry. So at JSC we have nine employee resource groups.  Host: Nine.  Jessica Vos: Which is quite a few, yeah. We have nine. And they're all a part of the Inclusion and Innovation Council Initiative, the I&I Council Initiative. And what's really awesome is that the leadership is all made up of employee volunteers. This is a side job for everybody.  Host: Okay.  Jessica Vos: And a side job that we don't get paid for. And rarely thanked for honestly.  Host: Oh, come on.  Jessica Vos: But they do incredible work. Including things like this panel. In general, all the ERGs provide augmented support to the existing management tools and HR systems that are already in place for recruiting and onboarding. Knowledge sharing. Workforce engagement. And employer retention. But we do it that are in ways that are specific to the needs of our membership, the ERG membership.  Host: Okay.  Jessica Vos: So we really want to enable each and every individual employee to be able to bring their authentic selves to work every day and uniquely contribute to the agency's mission.  Host: Now, in a minute here we're going to let people hear a panel presentation that WELL organized. What's the goal in having this event?  Jessica Vos: So you may have been a part of, long-time listeners as you mentioned earlier. You may be familiar with the fact that this year has been really exciting for NASA. There's a couple of things; right?  Host: Yeah.  Jessica Vos: That are huge accomplishments that we're celebrating.  Host: There's something about Apollo.  Jessica Vos: Yeah, something like landing, moon, lunar landing thing. So, yeah, it's been really incredible. And we are doing this as a part of the 50th anniversary events of Apollo 11. And we also wanted to focus on the fact that along with that announcement or along with that celebration, there's been an announcement that we're going back to the moon.  Host: Right.  Jessica Vos: In 2024 with the Artemis mission. So we really want, we are excited about being able to continue the human exploration of deep space in a different way. A more sustainable way. And we realize that that's going to look different and feel different. And require a lot of different methods and technologies than what we had in Apollo. So we thought it would be really neat to have a panel that kind of highlights the legacy of women here at JSC. And how they supported the Apollo program. And how they're currently supporting Artemis and human space flight in general. So this panel is going to touch on one of the main objectives of the I&I Council. Which is really to inspire the next generation and promote the agency's mission. So as we were saying, the incredible accomplishments of the Apollo program were fuelled by the extraordinary efforts of multiple teams of people learning and creating brand new ways to solve problems that had never been approached, right, let alone solved before. So in many ways the team supporting Artemis are in the same boat. Because while the overall goal of getting to the moon is the same as Apollo, the means and objectives of Artemis are quite different. Along with things like the political climate. The international partner engagement. Budgetary constraints. All of the, you know, the whole context in which we're accomplishing this goal now is very different. And for this panel specifically, taking place intentionally on women's equality day, August 26th.  Host: Okay.  Jessica Vos: We wanted to highlight the legacy of women at JSC who supported the Apollo program side by side with the perspectives of the women currently supporting the efforts to advance our ability to achieve future human space flight missions.  Host: Okay, would you do the honors then. Introduce us to the ladies that we're going to hear in the presentation coming up momentarily.  Jessica Vos: Absolutely. So today we're thrilled to have an incredible group of women who bring a really diverse suite of experts, sorry, expertise and experiences to the table. And I'll start off with a very dear friend of mine Dr. Jennifer Rochlis. She is the panel moderator. She brings over 20 years of experience to the table. And has supported many different organizations here on site at JSC. Including the Engineering Directorate, human resources and the Human Health and Performance Directorate. We're also super lucky because she has authored publications and book chapters in the areas of human factors engineering and human systems integration design. Including NASA's very own HSI, Human Systems Integration practitioners guide. She's also the founder and former chair of the HSI ERG who we're co-hosting this event with.  Host: Oh, okay.  Jessica Vos: So she's going to do an incredible job as moderator. We also have, for the first panelist from the Apollo era, is Mary Dunseith Henry. She has served, worked on site through Apollo 7 through Apollo 17. From Apollo 7 through Apollo 17. And she, I'm not going to give it away here. But she has an incredible story to tell that you probably know that includes Apollo 11.  Host: Yeah.  Jessica Vos: Right? And she has a really fun story to tell there. But she supported as a administrative specialist and external relations employee in that time. We also have Dianne Milner who supported here in the Apollo era and still currently works here today.  Host: Oh.  Jessica Vos: She started here back in Mercury.  Host: Goodness.  Jessica Vos: So she may be the longest employee, like, longest employee here.  Host: Badge number two.  Jessica Vos: Yeah, exactly. So we're sure that she's going to have quite a neat perspective to share just from having crossed that many different programs and been here that long. She's really truly seen the highs and lows that NASA has experienced in all of our programs; right? So that will be incredible to hear from her. And then the third Apollo era guest that we have or panelist that west is Estella Hernandez-Gillette. She was supporting the Apollo program as a stenographer and clerk for the engineering directorate. She started in 1964. And she supported, sorry, she was employed here at JSC for 42 years. She's now a professor down at University of Houston. So local. And she also served as the EO director, the equal opportunity office director here at --  Host: Right.  Jessica Vos: JSC for ten years. And then she, when she retired in 2006, she was serving as the deputy of external relations. So very interesting.  Host: Yeah.  Jessica Vos: Background there. And then we have two current panelists, meaning, as in they work here at JSC Today.  Host: Now.  Jessica Vos: And maybe a little bit younger as well. The first one is Dr. Sarah Wallace. She's a microbiologist. And she is the technical lead in our microbiology laboratory here on site. You may recall here name. She, has she done a podcast with you before?  Host: She did. She talked about the genes in space experiment.  Jessica Vos: Right.  Host: Where they identified microbes from start to finish without knowing what they were --  Jessica Vos: Right, DNA sequencing.  Host: In space for the first time.  Jessica Vos: Yeah, so she'll have, she has quite a bit of involvement in how it is that we are mitigating some of those risks for future space flight. Both to moon and beyond.  Host: Right.  Jessica Vos: Hopefully Mars; right? So it will be awesome to hear from her. And then the last panelist will be Miss Ashley White. She is an equal opportunity specialist here at JSC. She has also served as an accountant in JSC's travel office. And a human resource representative in the human resource office. So she has had a few different supporting orgs as well. And she, in general, has a lot of experience working with and supporting the women here at JSC. Both through our ERGs and otherwise. So, yeah, it's going to be a really awesome panel.  Host: All right then, “Women of JSC: Apollo to Artemis.” Here we go.  [ Music ]  Dr. Jennifer Rochlis: Okay, you guys ready to get started? Okay, Mary, I would love to start with you. Can you tell us what JSC was like when you first got here. And walk us through some of your first day at work.  Mary Dunseith Henry: Well, what JSC was like when I first got here was as exciting as the day that I left. I had come in from, I was working for the Air Force. And because of the Vietnam War my family wanted me back in Houston. So I was transferring from Macon, Georgia. Warner Robins Air Force Base to Ellington Field. But when I got to Ellington to interview, they had a freeze on. And so the young lady at human resources said, you can go to this organization down the road. We don't think it will be here long. But once our freeze is over, you can come back. So I went down the road and was fortunate enough to be hired. And never went back to the Air Force. It was an exciting time. We were a family. There was a large group, but a small group really in comparison to what was going on at the time. And I came right after the fire. So there was lot of mixed emotions going on at that time. And a lot of \"we can do\" going on at that time. And whether you were a secretary. An engineer. An admin. Or the telephone guy. Or the cafeteria. You were all part of a family. And it was a terrific family so.  Dr. Jennifer Rochlis: Thank you. [Inaudible] Hello. Got it, okay. Did I get yours, Dianne? You want to check it?  Dianne Milner: Hello.  Jessica Vos: Okay, good. Because I'm going to toss this to you real quickly because Dianne just told us the story of her first day on site. And I thought that was something worth sharing as well.  Dr. Jennifer Rochlis: I thought I was in prison. I went to the Rich Building that first summer that I worked here. And I didn't have my interim secret clearance yet. So I had to be escorted from the lobby to my desk. And then each trip to the bathroom, she was like a matron, you know, out of, right out of a prison. Would escort me down and wait and then escort me back. So but after that, you know, I got my interim secret clearance. I was all over the warehouse. The lab. Met people. Met my future husband. So I made the best of it after that. It was not a prison any longer.  Dr. Jennifer Rochlis: Ashley, can you tell us a little bit about what brought to you NASA and how you got into the industry?  Ashley White: Sure. Thank you for the opportunity to be on this panel with these illustrious women. So my story is a little different. Back in 2002, I was a sophomore at Prairie View A&M University. And we were having a career fair. And I will never forget it. We were walking around the Baby Dome. That's where the career fair was. And your feet are hurting because you're wearing shoes that you're not used to wearing. And I see the NASA booth. And I go, oh, there's no way, I was an accounting major. They don't want me. That's not for me. But my mother said apply for every opportunity. But nobody was at the table. They had already gone to lunch. So I may or may not have put my resume at the very top of the pile. And I may or may not have stood there for a while and made sure that my resume kept going to the top of the pile. And then I just walked away. Two weeks later I got a call from Anne Roemer saying, hey, would you be interested in a co-op opportunity. And I thought, at NASA? You, like, for, I'm not an engineer. Let me just really make that clear. No, no, no, we have business co-ops. Okay. Two weeks later we were on site. My grandparents had brought me here. But I may have forgotten my license at campus. So, you know, you can't get on site. So I had my interview in Building 110 in one of those back conference rooms. And I started that next week in January 2003. And this is the only company I've ever worked for.  [ Applause ]  Dr. Jennifer Rochlis: Sarah, I want to ask you a question about your org. And we're going to talk about your work a little bit later. But a lot of times, when we do lessons learned, we focus on what should we do better? And I really like to highlight for sure the things that we're already doing really well. That we want to keep doing really well. And so I want Sarah to talk a little bit about what she feels like in her discipline and her org, what are we doing really well in your mind that we need to keep doing? And that we, others should know?  Dr. Sarah Wallace: Yeah, am I on?  Dr. Jennifer Rochlis: You're on.  Dr. Sarah Wallace: All right. So I think that the things we are doing really well is we're, as new folks come in and, you know, we reach out. And we're really starting to work well across organizations. So a lot of the work I have done, I'm within human health and performance. But I've actually been with Astromaterials Research. So across orgs we're really working together. And then another thing we're trying to really do, and I think NASA's doing a great job of this is really communicating to the public what we're doing. So using social media. Using things to really communicate the great things going on here at NASA. All the way from the science to the engineering to the missions. So putting a lot of focus, not just on astronauts, which is so cool. But focus on the stuff we're doing here every day in our labs and in our meetings and various things. It may not be as fun, but we're making that exciting. And we're communicating it to the public. So I see a lot of collaboration going on. A lot of communication. Things that have definitely, I think, gotten so much stronger since I've been here.  Dr. Jennifer Rochlis: Thank you. Estella, like to know what advice you have for women here at NASA.  Estella Hernandez-Gillette: I'm sorry?  Dr. Jennifer Rochlis: What advice you have for women here at NASA. Some advice you have for women here.  Estella Hernandez-Gillette: Sorry.  Dr. Jennifer Rochlis: No, no.  Estella Hernandez-Gillette: I'm wearing hearing aids. Can anybody tell? Part of the perils of getting older. Advice for women. Get to know your organizations. Get to know where you are in the organization. And get to know anybody that wants to mentor you. I think it's still a day when we need, everybody needs a mentor. But I think seriously for women, we're still looking for role models and samples of what we want to become. And back in my day, in 1964 when I came here, that was really tough do. Now you have them all around you. I think there's lots of opportunities at NASA, the Johnson Space Center. I can't tell you what a great product I was for opportunity. Just look around you. Look for the opportunity. Get as prepared as you can. Get as many practice opportunities as you can. It's nice to do your job all the time. But give yourself a small percentage of time to go do other things that are other than your job. I think groups like the ERGs, things that are relevant to the Johnson Space Center and to the kind of work that we do, get involved with those. It's great to do a great job. But those involvements will also help you do a better job.  Dr. Jennifer Rochlis: Thank you for that. Dianne, I want to turn to you next. You arrived here sort of the end of the Mercury program. And been here through Gemini. And Apollo. Shuttle. ISS. A really distinguished career. An amazing body of work. You also have seen and experienced a significant number of highs and lows in your time here. Obviously some of the great highs of the Apollo landing and return. And shuttle flights. Also some significant lows in the Apollo 1 fire. And the Challenger and Columbia accidents. When you reflect back on that, can you talk about how you feel that those have really impacted the culture here at JSC. And I'd also like to hear about how you feel like they impacted you personally.  Dianne Milner: Actually, of course, starting back with, I came at the end of Mercury. So, of course, we had never put a human on a booster into space. So that was a stepping stone. We came to Gemini and, gosh, what we learned from Gemini almost losing a vehicle. But attitude control and the, we learned we needed to learn EVA skills. So we came back here and built pools to teach the astronauts. But then the Apollo 1 fire I think was most devastating to me because it was a realization that we can lose precious crew in a flight test on the pad. And not in orbit, you know. So that came home. There was so many things that had to be redone on the command module then. I was told it was almost redesigned. Specifically, no, but no one knew we couldn't use pure oxygen. So then, as we go on, we're learning from our mistakes. We didn't have a lot to work with. If you can imagine no computers. No e-mails. And nothing but short of slide rules and maybe there was a mainframe computer that would now be the size of what's on your desk now. But as we came on, we had, again, lots of success through the station and the shuttle program. And then we had to learn what, you know, we learned on Challenger. So as far as the culture, we went on. We moved on, but we learned. At the precious loss of lives, but we did learn.  Dr. Jennifer Rochlis: Glad to hear that. Mary, also you have seen an amazing amount as well. You were working in the SPAN Room. Which is the spacecraft analysis room for those of you who don't know in the Apollo program mission control office. And you were here from Apollo 7 through 11. Can you talk about some of your most memorable experiences from that time. And I know you mentioned getting here right after Apollo 1. So there was probably quite a change in the pace and things to through that time.  Mary Dunseith Henry: Change in pace.  Dr. Jennifer Rochlis: Well, that as well from, you know, beginning to the end of the Apollo program. And just whatever memorable experiences you'd like to highlight for us in that time for you.  Mary Dunseith Henry: Okay. And just a small correction. When I came on board, I was, got a position in Dave Lang’s directorate, which was Procurement. But then I was assigned to the Apollo program office to work the SPAN Room during missions. Which was very, very exciting. Because you work during the day. You got off at 5:00, and you reported about 6:00. And you got off about 2:00. And then you reported at 8:30 again in the morning. But the most memorable of all of the missions that I did help support would be Apollo 11. When it was kind of new with the president talking to, whoever the president was at the time. Talking from the control center to the astronauts once they were wherever they were. And with 11, when they landed on the moon, of course, President Nixon was our president at that time. And the SPAN Room is a small room off of the control center where a lot of anomalies are taking place. Engineers are in there. Different staff members. And I was the secretarial support for that area at that time. And everybody had gone because, of course, we had landed. And they were waiting for, you know, the first step and that sort of thing. So I was by myself in the SPAN Room. And the phone rang. And when I answered it appropriately like you should, this gentleman was very excited. And said he had to get into the control center. That his calls were not going through. And wanted to know if I knew of some way that he could do that. And so I asked him his name as we would as secretaries. And he said, I'm the president. And I said, yes, sir, but of which company are you the president? So that kind of traveled real quick. When I, and there was nobody there. So I had to put him on hold. So I said, could you please hold a moment, and I will find out what we need to do. So when I came out of the SPAN Room and the control center at that time had little alleyways, I guess, that were going. And at the very end where people couldn't get in was all of the news media. So it came out, secretary puts president on hold. So we get into the control center, and I get him transferred. And all of that was really, really good and became very exciting. And everything went well. Just like what they were mentioning. And with every launch there is that anticipation. Because of what had happened before that we were vulnerable in some ways. But we had the best of the best working on everything. And the next thing would have been Apollo 13. And when you, you've all seen the movie, I'm sure. You've all been part of that whole experience. My husband was Lynn Dunseith. And he was director over computer systems at that time. And when all of that came about where they showed the going into the back room or side room. And saying this is what they have in the LEM. How are we going to get them home? And so that was exciting for my children to know that dad new how all of that happened. Now, we have five children. And they learned more about Lynn at his funeral than they ever knew when he was alive. Because engineers, they didn't talk about their job. They were top secret situations. And so they knew he worked at NASA. They knew they could come on a tour. But that was exciting for all of us. And I was so glad to get to experience all of that. And then ending with, I stayed on after Apollo. But the, ending with Gene Cernan's flight was a big one for me. He was such a personal, all the astronauts were personal and kind to us. But, you know, sometimes you just kind of get with somebody that you can really sit and talk. Have coffee or do whatever. And not feel that you, you're not, that you should be staunch so.  Dr. Jennifer Rochlis: Can you say a little more, Mary, about what it was like to be a woman in the mission control oort cloud at the time running around.  Mary Dunseith Henry: Well, being a woman in mission control for me was pretty exciting. I'm a woman who likes doors opened. I like being treated respectfully. And I like, I appreciated my, whatever you would call it, if you would call it my place. I was a secretary. Very proud secretary. I wouldn't mind if I served you coffee or a Estella coffee or anybody else in this room coffee. But we had a job to do, and we knew what we needed to do. And it was exciting. And I probably could have gone further in my career. All of my friends did. Estella was a secretary with me. Several of these ladies on this front row were secretaries with me. But I chose to go home and raise children. And so all of it's been great. And God put us where we needed to be, and he's been blessing us ever since.  Dr. Jennifer Rochlis: Thank you for that. Speaking of Estella, I'd like to know how you feel the work of equal opportunity has changed? And I'd love to hear about how it changed throughout your career as the director of the office when you were here.  Estella Hernandez-Gillette: You know, equal opportunity came about legally through affirmative action laws and all of that. But here at Johnson, we could see the movement already beginning. Now, most of us who were female were secretaries. I can count on one hand how many technical women there were. And recently Teresa Sullivan and I had an experience where \"LA Times\" was looking to interview technical women of Apollo era. And I think we found one, okay. There were others, but that we had tracked, we found one. On the other hand, we had the 60s chicks. And I'd like to ask them to stand please. Those of you who were part of our 60s chicks.  [ Applause ]  These were, we were all women who were supporting the program. And like Mary said, we were doing whatever it took to do. Nobody asked questions. We just did it. And I tell you what, we were very good at what we did. So, you know, whatever you do, just be good at it. But as far as equal opportunity, you know, through my 40 years at the Johnson Space Center, I saw the movement get wider and wider and wider. And it came about mostly because now we had women for the technical side of JSC here. We had women who were going to college to get degrees, STEM-related degrees, okay. Early on there were not that many women going into STEM degrees. And I know that NASA and lots of other industry were very much involved with making sure that we had that reach out to the community. To make sure that women were getting interested and going into STEM-related fields. Once that happened, and I was on the astronaut selection board in 1979, '80. I can remember still we had just trickles of women who were qualified to become astronauts even then, okay. However, through the years, and I'll make this an example with Eileen Collins. We were looking for, in the astronaut selection, we were looking for women pilots, okay. If anybody knows about the qualifications for pilot, you kind of have to go, you can't rent a jet and go get that kind of practice, okay. So you kind of had to be in the test pilot school in the military, all right. So women were not allowed, until I think 1972, into test pilot school, okay. Eileen Collins was one of those who was allowed. And eventually a few years later she became our first female pilot astronaut, okay. That's kind of how it was happening. At the Johnson Space Center, I could see that very, very well moving on. And that's because I came here in 1964, when you can count the women in one hand who were technical. You could count the minorities on one hand who were at Johnson. And little by little we began to reach out to the community. I think 35 of my 40 years were part of, were involved in outreach. So now that I teach at the University of Houston and I look at my classrooms, I see that it worked. The outreach of other, not just NASA, but other communities going out there and making sure that we start at the bottom and start little kids getting interested. And not wait to the last minute and then wonder where we're going to get qualified people. So I think the country has done a great job as far as making sure that we get people involved at the bottom in education. And then in the job market, you get, you know, when I was director of equal opportunity, we used something called the relevant civilian labor force to measure who, how many we should have in each category. And that worked because you kind of go to the population that can do the job here. And that's where we draw from. You can't draw from the general population because they don't have the qualifications to do the kind of work that we do here. It's a very, and I'm sure you've experienced this. But it seemed to be a more quantitative way of going out and looking for folks. Making sure that, number one, we were involved with the development of the people that we wanted to recruit here. And, number two, once they get here, make sure that we develop people constantly over and over, giving them practice. And that's why I teach human resource development now. Because I think that is the way to do people, to get people qualified better. And to really be a part of the organization.  Dr. Jennifer Rochlis: Yeah, I think that's wonderful. Especially since onboarding is a really significant part of all of our employer resource group's charters. Not only to bring folks on, but also to onboard them into what it's like to be working here at the space center. And how we can help support them going forward. So following on what you said, Ashley, I'd love to hear also from you in your role with the equal opportunity diversity. Talk to us a little bit about how your role has really shaped what's been going on here in the last few years. We now have inclusive innovation as part of our, you know, core tenets. And we've been doing so much work in that area. I'd love to know how you think going forward our workforce might need to adapt to what our challenges are coming at us with our new programs and everything else.  Ashley White: So this is an honor to share the stage. We see her picture in our office as a, literally every day. So when I walked in, I said, oh, hi. Because we are standing on the shoulders of such great work. So we are so appreciative. And this is the work that we are charged to continue to do. We look at the people, the policies and the procedure that are in place to make sure that it's a workplace free of discrimination. Retaliation. And harassment. So one of those aspects that we're doing to help is training. In fact, before I came here I was in the Gilruth talking to about 50 or 60 of our education interns. Making sure that they know what their rights and responsibilities are. Every year we do training through human resource management to managers so that everybody understands what their roles and responsibilities are. We take very seriously conflict resolution and mediation. Because unsolved conflict brews under the surface. And it becomes much more about than just that one thing. And it impacts and can really mess up an organization if it's not handled at the lowest level. You already spoke about the great work that the ERGs are doing. Our role in our office is to give them the maximum support possible to help them dream bigger dreams. You want to go where? Okay, well, let's figure out how we can do that. You want to do a panel? Okay, well, let's see how, what resources that we have within our office to do so. But we focus on reasonable accommodations. That is huge to make sure every single employee here understands their worth. And that they are valued. They are opinions matter. And if they need some additional assistance, our office is here in coordination with the center to make sure they have the resources they need.  Dr. Jennifer Rochlis: So talk to us a little bit about the next few years. We're going to have potentially a large ramp up in work. And deadlines. And what are some of the things that we need to be thinking about to support our workforce if we hire on, you know, a great deal more folks? Do we do temporary? Or however that looks. We're going to need all hands on deck to get this done. Are there things that you think we need to be putting in place now to really support that? Or what are some things that you think ahead we should consider?  Ashley White: We must always remember our JSC expected behaviors. Because regardless of what the work is or the pace of the work. If we don't respect one another. If we don't have tenets of teamwork and loyalty and integrity. We won't reach that next level. I think it's very important that we are respective and respectful of age. We had an employee last week retire with 54 years of experience. But we also have employees here with less than six months. So making sure that it's an equal playing field. That people feel like their opinions are valued. That they're heard. And especially in a safety culture, if you're like, well, no, I just got here. I can't say anything. That doesn't help us continue to improve. So I think, as we look ahead, making sure that we really use diversity and inclusion. Not just as tag words, but really tenets of who we stand for as JSC.  Dr. Jennifer Rochlis: Thank you so much for that. I agree wholeheartedly. And thinking on words to the future, I want to, Sarah, talk to you a little bit about your work. So you were part of the team that launched the first DNA sequencer to the ISS. Which is incredibly exciting. Congratulations. And that, also along with some of your other studies, have lead to the identification of some microbiomes that have been cultured off Earth. Which is also very exciting. So can you share with us the significance of your work. And also I'd love for you to tell us where you think the future of this work is headed. Especially as we try to get more Earth independent.  Dr. Sarah Wallace: Yeah, so I think that we, in the life sciences, we look at ISS as this incredible platform for research. And an opportunity for us to learn. And for so long we've kind of operated in this world of, you know, we grow, we expose whatever model organism or whatever it is to the conditions of space flight. And then we bring the samples back to Earth for analysis. So what the team I'm on and the work we're doing is really to try to take really our labs and put them on ISS to give us the capability to do that analysis on board. And for me specifically as a micro biologist, we launched the DNA sequencer just to show that it would work. But then we really tried take it to the next level with, some of our routine work that we do is checking up on what the environment looks like microbially. And so actually having astronaut Peggy Whitson take some of these things that we routinely culture. Open them and identify them all on board the ISS. Which is a first. And we've never been able to do that. So we're really excited just to show that capability that we have, you know, we can do this stuff on Earth. We don't need to always fix or freeze a sample and bring it back. We can do it all in space. And I really think that this is going to be critical as we go forward. So as we look beyond ISS and we look towards exploration class missions, we need technologies that can give us real-time input on the environment that the crew's exposed to. Crew health themselves. Every aspect of that. And so I really think that these technologies will be absolutely critical. And that's the work we're continuing to try to do is to take it even one step further. Make it even more simple. Go beyond microbes. We've started doing some human work. And looking at the way, you know, developing methods that we can use to maybe understand how astronauts are responding to different things. And so I think there's a lot of potential. And I'm just, I'm really excited because I see the work that my colleagues are doing in similar areas. And I just think, in terms of the science, we're getting back. And in terms of getting us ready to go beyond ISS, we're really getting there. So which is a really exciting time. And I think it's, we're all eager. And we're all excited to, those of us that weren't around during Apollo. We're all just so excited to be able to be a part of that as we go forward with Artemis. And, you know, we're excited for our technologies and our methods to make an impact there. And I really think they will. And I think that we have a lot of good work still to do. But we've done a lot to really show that we have these capabilities now.  Dr. Jennifer Rochlis: So interestingly, in our world we talk a lot about astronaut health, as you said. And we have, you know, quarantine has always been something that after the Apollo missions was, you know, taken very seriously. And I know some of the conferences in the human health and performance world, lately we've been talking a lot about planetary and protection. And can you speak a little bit about how important that is as we're learning more about areas in your field of study. What the responsibility is that we have as we go and explore. And kind of how we can really relate that back to plan those designs for that.  Dr. Sarah Wallace: Yeah, so within that kind of, within the realm of planetary protection, there's always two things we're worried about. And I would say, when we went to the moon the first time, we weren't so, we weren't as worried about contaminating the moon. We were worried about back-contaminating Earth. Which was why the quarantine of the astronauts over in the old building 37 was so important. Because, if there was some andromeda strain, we wanted to make sure we weren't exposing, you know, population of Earth to this. So NASA took that very seriously. And so that's, you know, there's great stories. If you're interested, find me later. I know them all. So it was a really exciting time. But now, as we look, we're still always going to be worried about that, as we haven't explored Mars and some of these other bodies. Enceladus. Europa. That, you know, many scientists are excited might harbor life. So really there's those two aspects of, one, not bringing anything back. And, two, how much we're contaminating it. We are walking microbiomes. We have all these bacteria that are associated with us. That, you know, we don't want to, if there is life there, we don't want to impact that life on that planet or moon. So really having the capability to get a good baseline to understand what we have in us and on us. What's in and on our spacecraft vehicles. On the space suits. Every little aspect of this is really important to establish that baseline so we can understand what we are, you know, contributing potentially to another surface. And so that, you know, then, if we do find something, is that novel or is that something we put there? So, and, again, always monitoring what we're bringing back with us. So those are the two big areas we're concerned with. And we're, with the technology we have now with the DNA sequencer and the methods we've developed, we're really excited. We're working with all of our international partners to really kind of form one method that we can all use to really start piecing all this together. So all of that's in work. And I think the next few years are going to be really exciting as we have the technologies to both screen for life beyond Earth. And measure what we're taking with us beyond Earth.  Dr. Jennifer Rochlis: Thank you. I appreciate that perspective of sort of the big picture of some reasons of why we go. And what we're thinking of, you know, when we pick our head up and go where are we aiming for? What are we trying to accomplish? And to that end also, Dianne and I were talking earlier. I'd love to hear, Dianne, your thoughts. You alluded to sort of the, we talked a little bit about the pace of the work that was happening around the Apollo time. And we're being tasked for the next four years to do something very similar. And, you know, the methods you mentioned were different than they are now. Can you talk about how you think we might be able to face that challenge of this quick turnaround. But you also have some great perspective on what the pace in life was like here beforehand.  Dianne Milner: Well, actually it was a very heated rush, pressure to get to the moon for Apollo 11. And the technologies that we had to work with back then were really primitive compared to what we have now. So I think personally going to the moon in 2024 is going to be a piece of cake. But realistically I think we have the technology. The brilliance in our community and workforce here to make sure it's done right. And it's going to be right before we go. We have certainly a deadline, but I don't feel the pressure, unless it's right, that we'll go before then. But I think we'll get there definitely. Maybe not exactly 2024, but close to it.  Dr. Jennifer Rochlis: Thank you for that. So I want to pause for a second and just remind that you in about five minutes we're going to go to our Slido questions. So if haven't already contributed and you would like to, please do that. And, Jessica, I'm just going to confirm with you, I'm going to do one more round. And then you're going to toss it over to Slido for the, up to the end; right? So, okay, great. So I kind of wanted to go down the road this time, since we've got about five minutes before we throw it out to the audience. I would love to hear from each of you what nugget do you want to leave this audience with, this group? This group that's really intent on learning from how we've done things and where we need to be going forward. What is any nugget that you would like to share with this group? Love to hear it? Mary, do you want to start us off?  Mary Dunseith Henry: Well, I guess what I'd like to say is for those of you who are still working here and those of you who are retired from here. It's the greatest opportunity that we had or will have. We all touch somebody. And whether it's mentoring a young person that's on their way up. Just knowing that this is it. This is the greatest place to start your career and end your career here, if that need be. But the people that you meet, the mentors that you have. And I don't believe there's one NASA employee or past employee that you couldn't reach out to if you had a question. We are all available. And we all want to go in the same direction. So that's the nugget I would leave.  Dr. Jennifer Rochlis: Thank you. Ashley.  Ashley White: So the best piece of advice I got, I actually got recently. Couple years ago I was struggling with trying to balance work and caring for an ailing grandmother. And my manager said to me, be your best wherever you are. So if you're at work, fully commitment to being at work. If you're in the hospital, fully commitment to caring for her. And that's freed me from trying to be everything to every person at all times. And I wasn't giving anybody my best. So if I could give you what was given to me, be your best wherever you are. And if that means, excuse me, having to have a pep rally of one before a meeting. If that means sitting in your car and getting your mind right before you walk into work. Do whatever it is that you need to do to make sure you're your best wherever you are.  Estella Hernandez-Gillette: Dang, that's a tough one. Because I have so much advice I could give you guys. So much. Yeah, lots. But I think, you know, and I go back to 1964. When I came in 1964, it was October 19th, 1964. Memorable day for me. The Johnson Space Center the Manned Spacecraft Center had just opened the gates. So there were a few buildings. It was me coming here and saying, oh, my God, what have I done? Because, when I applied for the government service and I passed, this was just a few months after I became a naturalized citizen. Because I was born in Mexico. And I passed a civil service exam. And I came here. I had three interviews. And I went home and told my mom and my dad that I had a job offer. In fact, I had three job offers. And my mom and dad said, you're not going there. I said, why not? It's too far to drive. You're not going there. Because we lived on the other side of the Pierce Elevated now. And my, and I said, yes, I am. And, you know, Mexican culture, very, very strict. And that was a very rebellious thing for me to do is to say, yes, I am. And my mom says, you don't have a car. I said, I'll buy one. So I bought a car. I was here. Three months later my dad talked about me as if I owned the Johnson – or the Manned Spacecraft Center. He was so proud. He was so proud. But coming here was so scary. Because there weren't a lot of people that looked like me. And I wasn't even really conscious of that. It was just that it was mostly white men. And they were mostly wearing white shirts with black ties and pocket protectors. They really did wear those, okay. And, but what I found was that, because I was good at what I was supposed to be doing, they all thought I was great. And because I started as a secretary and I got my training in high school, Jeff Davis High School here in town. They thought, the guys that I worked with, there were 21 of them. And it was Building 13, Structures and Mechanics Division in Building, yeah, 13. They thought I was fascinating because I could type 98 words a minute, okay. I could take shorthand at 80 words a minute, you know. And I think a lot of us could do that in that time, okay. So I think the best advice I can give you is do the job you're supposed to be doing and do the best at it. And in the meantime pick up some additional skills for the next job that you're going to. But I met a few people along the way who aspired for other things, but they weren't really doing what they were supposed to be doing already. So my advice is look at your job description. What are you supposed to be doing? I mentioned the mentoring already. You mentioned respect and dignity. Those go a long way. So I think this is a wonderful home. Like Mary says, and I think all of us would agree here, it's a wonderful place to work. If somebody had told me in 1963, when I graduated from high school, that I was going to make a career out of here. I would have said, NASA, what's that? Because I did not know what NASA was until my yearbook featured the original seven astronauts. And then I knew what NASA was. And I made it home here. It's like a family. Mary mentioned the family a few times. It is a family. Find out who the members are. Find out what works and what doesn't work. Look at the people around you. What do they do? Who do you want to become like? You have so many goods examples. There's historical examples. There's current examples. And I marvel at this young lady [indicates Sarah Wallace] and what she's doing. I wish I had done that. So I really could go on and on about all the wonderful things here. But just enjoy what you do. And consider yourself privileged because you really are.  Dr. Sarah Wallace: Well, that's hard to follow. But I just want to build on what Estella said. It's the, if you have passion, and anyone who knows me knows I, absolutely incredibly passionate about what I do. But it's, don't take no for an answer. It's, I have been told no so many times about an idea. Or, you know, something simple to something big. But I don't let that stop me. And you just, if you have an idea that you really believe in. And you're really passionate about. And you really see the benefit. Just keep pushing. And, you know, there's been times I've been concerned is it my age? Is it the way I look? What is it that I'm, you know, being told no about? And you don't stop to where then, you know, you, I feel like our work now is having a huge impact. And what we're doing is really causing change. And that's so great. Because I look back to a couple years ago, and it was just like dead end after dead end. So just don't stop. If you're passionate, just keep going. And somebody will finally, you know, you'll get somebody to kind of buy into what you're saying. And hopefully, you know, we can all continue to move mountains and get us closer to our next goal.  Dr. Jennifer Rochlis: Love that. Thank you. Dianne, you want to bring us home?  Dianne Milner: Yes. I was just thinking out at Rice Stadium there's a big billboard that says, be the best that you can be. And I think that more or less sums it up. If you're bored, if you're not interested, change jobs. Find something else. But be happy with what you're doing. Be involved with others that you're working with. And you have a challenge out there to satisfy yourself and be successful. Follow that dream, that hope, and you will be.  Dr. Jennifer Rochlis: Thank you. That's a beautiful way to end. Thank you so much for all of your participation. I think we're going to throw it back over to our moderators to do the questions. So let me just give you all a round of applause from myself personally. Thank you for answering my questions and for talking to us today. Thank you so much.  [ Applause ]  Question: So this first question is for Sarah and Ashley. What does equality at JSC and NASA mean to you? Have we achieved it? Or what more should we strive for?  Ashley White: You said equality?  Question: Yes, equality.  Ashley White: What does it mean to me? And has it been achieved at NASA? It is an everlasting goal. Because just when you think you have reached it, the marks change. We are, diversity is not a one-time fix. The same thing with equality. But it's making sure that we have a fair and balanced workforce. And that every opportunity is equal to everyone. So for me I think JSC is striving. We are striving to be what we call on our side of the house an EEO model center. And that is where we put practices and plans in place to ensure that we're continuing to improve. Because, as we have all these new challenges, the same thing arises on the mission support side to make sure that we don't stay stagnant. What worked 50 years ago has changed. And being open to embracing the newness of people. The newness of ideas. The diversity of thought.  Dr. Sarah Wallace: And I agree completely. And I would say there's always that, when, you know, when I was talking about, you know, being told no or something. There's always that little ugliness in the back of your mind. It's like is it because, what is it? Is it because I'm female? Is it because I'm young? I dye my hair blond, what is it? And so it's, there's always that, but I think we are moving past that. And equality for me is, you know, anyone of us can be taken as seriously as, you know, a senior or male who's been here for a much longer time. And I think we are getting there. But as you're saying, it's always, you know, I feel like we always need to be striving to make sure we're keeping to progress in that way. And listen to everybody's ideas and everybody's thoughts regardless, you know, of their background. And, you know, I think that JSC is doing a phenomenal job of this. And we are keeping it very at the front of our mind. And I think we'll continue to do so.  Question: Next question for our Apollo guests. What traits do you see that are common to all women who have been successful here at JSC?  Dianne Milner: I think loyalty and ambition. You know, I've seen those two outstanding traits. Willingness to work. To get their goals, what they want to do.  Mary Dunseith Henry: I'll just mirror what she said as well. But I think Estella could probably answer this question very well.  [ Laughter ]  Estella Hernandez-Gillette: Mary used to do that to me all the time when we worked together. She's still doing it. What traits? I looked at women like Marilyn Bocktine. Some of you remember Marilyn. Virginia Hughes, okay. She was federal women's program manager. Carolyn Huntoon. Who was kind of like way up there because she was a scientist. And, you know, she one of the guys too. I think what I wanted to become was one of the guys, but still be a female. You know, what I'm saying? I mean, I liked the world that the men seemed to have built. And, you know, I kind of eased my way into it by doing what I said earlier. Mimicking some of the women that were my role models like Marilyn Bocktine. One of the things that I realized early on is, if I looked for a role model that looked like me, I couldn't find one back then, okay. So I looked for a role model that was in the same discipline as I was. And Marilyn was secretary to George Low, okay. Kind of Apollo father kind of guy. But she was so fun. Virginia Hughes was so fun. So look for those traits that you think are important to you and that you can imitate or become like. But also look for the traits that the guys have, okay. I had bosses like George Abbey. One day I want to become just like him when I grow up, okay. I had bosses like Cliff Charlesworth, Apollo 11 and Apollo 13. Who everybody said was not very friendly. But he was soft as a pussycat. He was just such a nice guy when I finally found out who he was. I had bosses like John Young. Who was exciting to be around just because of what he had done. But I picked up traits from all of them, not just women, okay. Because I think it's important to blend the characteristics of those people who make this place what it is. So if you kind of look too much for something that you're really comfortable with, then you'll never change and get there. So look for things that you're not comfortable with, I think.  Dr. Jennifer Rochlis: Thank you. Okay.  Question: So our last question for today. Did any of you have a male mentor or supporter who encouraged you in your careers? If so, can you talk about your advice or their advice?  Mary Dunseith Henry: Can you repeat that question.  Dr. Jennifer Rochlis: Did any of you have you a male mentor in your career that supported you? And can you tell us a little bit about their advice to you? Is that, did I catch that right? Okay.  Mary Dunseith Henry: So a male mentor for me would have been John Zarcaro. And he was very good at what he did. And he was a very kind man. And he always supported you when you got something bad. In those days our letters didn't just go out, we typed them. And we had to make carbon copies. We didn't have corrective tape or anything like that. So we had a woman, Estella, what was her name? You know who I'm talking about. [Laughter] Y’all know who I'm talking about. What was her name?  Audience: Lee Brubaker.  Estella Hernandez-Gillette: Brubaker.  Mary Dunseith Henry: No.  Audience: Iris Garner.  Audience: Betsy.  Mary Dunseith Henry: Okay. I guess I don't know. My letters from the ninth floor went through Lee Brubaker. That's who my letters went through. And she was a really sweet person. Kind of like what Estella said about Cliff Charlesworth. When we came to work, she went to work for Charlesworth. And I went to work for Zarcaro. I was afraid of Charlesworth until you got to know him. But she had the reputation of carrying a big stick. And you didn't want your letter that needed to be out by five o'clock and she wasn't going to get it till 3:00 along with the other 300 letters that she was getting from all of the other secretarial staff. So that's kind of where I'm coming from.  Dr. Jennifer Rochlis: Male mentor, does anybody want to share?  Dr. Sarah Wallace: Yeah. So the NASA microbiologist before me, Duane Pierson and Mark Ott, who I look up to both tremendously. But Mark was, has actually been a mentor for me since I was in graduate school. And he always, you know, coming back to what you're passionate about and your work ethic. He always told me, you know, cream rises to the top. So if you work hard, while there are days here that it seems like nothing is working. And there's politics and there's other things involved. At the end, if you continue to work hard and do good work, it will be seen. And you will be recognized for it. And so that has absolutely held true for me. So the times where, you know, he's been very good about when things have been rough, you know, in the end, if you work hard, things will come through.  Dr. Jennifer Rochlis: Actually, am I allowed to break protocol and answer this question?  Question: Yeah.  Dr. Jennifer Rochlis: Yeah, okay. So I had two fantastic male mentors. The first one was Walt Guy. Who some of you know and have worked with. He was the head of the engineering robotics department when I was first there. And he was sort of a silent supporter. I never knew he was championing me from behind the scenes, but he was the entire time. And the advice I got with working for Walt, if you know Walt and you've done disk assessments, he's very green. He likes the data. And he liked to know all the information before making a decision. And so the advice I got was, you're going to go up in front of Walt, make sure you know. And if he asks you a question you don't know the answer, tell them you don't know the answer. And if you do know the answer and you want to, you know, go back and forth, go back and forth. Because you know, and you've got the data to back it up. And that was the best advice I ever got working with him. And as a result, we formed this very trusting bond. He knew he could come to me, and I would tell it like it was. Or I'd say, I have no idea. But that's a darn good question. I'm going to go find out. So that was a piece of advice that I really took to heart. Especially working with people who just like the facts. The other mentor that had was Steve Altemus. Who was the head of Engineering Directorate. And I was up as an executive intern for a few months. And I had been here about seven or eight years. And he says to me one day, Jen, what do you want to do? What do you want to do here? I was like, nobody's ever asked me that before. I think when I got here I thought, okay, I'm ready for my next assignment. I'm ready for my next assignment. I'm ready for my next assignment. And he was the first person who said, what do you want to do? And I told him. I said, I think it's really important that we get humans integrated into the spacecraft from the beginning. And he said, I think that's great. So he asked me to go work constellation from the engineering perspective with the human systems group and partner with the human health and performance, that then was space lab sciences. And we made a great team and did that work going forward. And he, and, you know, I heard this phrase from him. You know, no one's going to care about your career more than you do. And so it's great to have mentors and leads and advices, but you've got to take that initiative. And he switched the bit in my mind that I was responsible for making things happen. And so I really appreciate that. And I guess the only other nugget I would leave all of our panelists with is I very much value showing up with authenticity. I think we bring our whole selves to work. It sounds trite sometimes, but it's really true when you work from a place, an authentic place. And I think all of you have touched on that in your stories. I've heard that. That nugget is, when you come through and you are your authentic self. And you're showing up that way, that's what creates that community and that bond and that opportunity for everyone. So thanks for letting me break protocol and answer. Because I've only got a week or two, so I got to get it out now. Thank you all so much for your participation. And I think we're going to hand it back to Vanessa and Jessica for wrapping up.  Vanessa Wyche: Awesome. What a wonderful, wonderful panel. Thank you.  [ Applause ]  [ Music ]  Host: All right then. That's a really interesting discussion, Jessica. Kudos to WELL for getting these women to share their thoughts on the panel. And letting us share it with this wider audience.  Jessica Vos: Oh, gosh, thank you so much for the opportunity.

                        "description": "Gary Jordan (Host): Houston, we have a podcast. Welcome to the official podcast of the NASA Johnson Space Center, Episode 115: “Air to Space.” I'm Gary Jordan, I’ll be your host today. If you're new to the show, we bring in the experts to talk about all different parts of human spaceflight. Long time listeners of this show know that human spaceflight takes a lot of collaboration, collaboration within NASA, with other space agencies, with commercial businesses, and even other parts of the U.S. government, for day-to-day space operations. In the case of the International Space Station, NASA works with the Department of Defense Space Surveillance Network to track objects larger than 10 centimeters in low Earth orbit, many of which is orbital debris. Knowing where these objects are is a part of keeping the Space Station in a safe orbit, as well as the Global Positioning System, the GPS satellites, that actually help to navigate the space station. This is just one or a few elements of what the Department of Defense does in space and how the relationship works with NASA. Today, we have very special guests, to hone in on this one branch of the military, the Air Force. The Air Force and NASA have a very special relationship. A lot of astronauts come from the Air Force, among other things. So, we're going to break that down. Today, we sit down with General Stephen W. Wilson and Colonel Nick Hague. General Wilson is the vice-chief of Staff for the U.S. Air Force. If you're unfamiliar with the hierarchy of military branches, that's really far up there. In this position, he assists the chief of staff with organizing, training, and equipping 685,000 active duty, guard, reserve, and civilian forces serving in the U.S. and overseas. We also sit down with Nick Hague, U.S. Air Force colonel and NASA astronaut, who landed from his 203-day stay aboard the International Space Station very recently, this October, 2019. The two go into detail on the roles and responsibilities of the U.S. Air Force, how the Air Force and NASA work together, and the future in space for the Air Force, NASA, and even the future of the Space Force. So, here we go. The Air Force and NASA with General Stephen Wilson and Colonel Nick Hague. Enjoy.  [Music ]  Host: General Wilson and Colonel Hague, thank you so much for coming on Houston, We Have a Podcast today.  General Stephen Wilson: It's great to be here, Gary. Thanks.  Colonel Nick Hague: Pleasure, pleasure.  Host: First, actually, Colonel Hague, I'd like to say welcome back to Earth. It was not too long that you were in space for 203 days. How is adjusting back to Earth?  Nick Hague: The re-adaptation is fast.  Host: Oh, wow.  Nick Hague: You know, 10 days, and I feel almost normal again. The first couple of days were pretty shaky, just trying to get good balance and figuring out what gravity is about again. And, but it's been nice to be home, absolutely.  Host: Wonderful. It's good to have you home, and General Wilson, it's good to have you here. This is why we have the two of you here, Air Force and NASA together. Let's get right into it. General Wilson, if you can go over a bit of your responsibilities as vice-chief of staff for the Air Force, what you do there?  Stephen Wilson: Yeah, so my job is to help our chief in three major roles. My chief organizes, trains and equips 685,000 airmen who span the globe. So, I call that as just an institutional chief. All the services have the same, so the Army, the Navy, and the Air Force, the Marines have the same thing. He's also an international air chief, so he meets with all of his partners there to make sure we've got the right allies and partners around the globe, and that we're interoperable amongst our forces. And then, he's a member of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, to provide the best military advice to the chairman and SecDef [secretary of Defense] as they advise the senior leadership of our nation. So, he wears those three hats, and I help represent him in doing those duties.  Host: It's a great responsibility that you have there. That's a lot of people, 685,000 airmen, I believe?  Stephen Wilson: Yeah. So, we're a big company. So, take a big company like IBM, you know, we're about seven times the size of IBM, just to put it in scope and size.  Host: So, what does that mean, to organize, train, and equip, what does that mean, exactly?  Stephen Wilson: Yeah, so today, right now, we have to make sure all of our forces are ready. So, we woke up as a nation and thought differently on September 10 than we did on September 12, 2001, and so, we've got to be ready. And so, making sure our forces are trained to do the jobs that we ask them to do. Right now, I say, we defend the homeland. We own the high ground of air and space, and we have to be able to project combat power forward anywhere across the globe, both through global reach and global power. So, that's what we do as an air force, in just broad terms. We also have to build the force of the future. So, as we keep some parts of our Air Force, all of our Air Force ready, we also have to look at, what does the force of the future look like? Look at the threat, look at our strategy, and look at our force design and how do we build that force, and so, we spend a lot of time on modernizing the force for the future that we need to have.  Host: Okay. So, what are you doing in Houston this week, then?  Stephen Wilson: That's a great outreach. We've got a great partnership with a big city, the fourth largest city in the country, and coming here, a) to get out of the Pentagon and to meet some of our amazing airmen like Nick here, who had this great partnership with this wonderful place called NASA, that we've been having -- the United States Air Force in partnership with NASA since 1959.  Host: That's right. It is a great relationship. And I actually wanted to go deeper into both of your stories, just to kind of get some more context and background on how this relationship comes and what it takes to be a part of these two organizations. Starting with you, General Wilson. I know you were commissioned from Texas A&M University in 1981, and you've had a lot of different positions.  Stephen Wilson: A lot of different…my wife and I have talked, we've moved 21 times, lived all over the United States, all over overseas, too, so we've had lots of amazing jobs. I did go to school right up the road, this little college there at College Station, Texas A&M University.  Host: That’s right.  Stephen Wilson: So, gig ‘em out there, and hope there's not too many Longhorn fans here on your podcast. But we, you know, that's kind of what's expected as the Air Force. You're going to move around a bunch. We talk about a value proposition when you join the Air Force. And you get to work with amazing people and amazing technology and to do amazing things to help protect our nation. And so, most people who say they join our Air Force because of the cool stuff, the technology, but they really stay because of the people.  Host: That's right. Now, you've stuck with the Air Force, and you've risen through the ranks, and it sounds like it's because of your passion for the job. Is that part of the reason why…  Stephen Wilson: Yeah, I'd say the passion for the people.  Host: Passion for the people.  Stephen Wilson: Yeah. Because you get to meet these people from all, you know, all across our country, and you go, where do we keep finding them. They're just so simply amazing. Every day, you meet somebody. You go, man, I'm glad they're on our team. I'm glad they're helping us. We often, you know, we have these core values in the Air Force, and we talk about integrity first, service before self, excellence in all you can do. You meet these people that, we didn't have to teach them that, they learned that around the dining room tables of their homes. And they're really, they're so dedicated and inspired and passionate about helping and making a difference and, you know, we get the opportunity to serve with them. So, that's a really fun part of our job.  Host: I know, and Colonel Hague, you can probably, you can speak to this, is I believe that idea of teamwork and working with people is very much a part of NASA, as well. I think it's, it's just a good quality to have, all around, to be able to work with others and appreciate others.  Nick Hague: Yeah, absolutely. You know, you look at, I look back at my experiences in the Air Force, and then I look at my time here at NASA, you can see the parallels in the workforce and its approach, the commitment to the mission. You know, obviously, the missions are different, but the, you just, the passion that everybody approaches their job with every day, whether it's in the Air Force or whether it's here at NASA, we're doing really difficult things, and we do them routinely. We do really dangerous things, and we do them safely. And we do that because we work together as a team. And so, teamwork is the lifeblood of either organization. It's really all about the people.  Host: Now, you've been a part of both. So, tell me about your career progression, going from the Air Force now to NASA.  Nick Hague: Yeah, so, you know, I get that question a lot, you know, how did you end up where you're at? A lot of people are interested. And I couldn't tell you how it happened, other than I was given a lot of amazing opportunities in the Air Force that gave me the background and the experience that I could bring to NASA and add to the team here. You know, that started out as an acquisitions officer. So, I was working in a lab, running a program, managing a spreadsheet. And some of my, you know, Ph.D.s that worked for me, you know, that were much brighter than I was, and, you know, from there, getting involved with flight test and being able to teach at the academy or getting exposure in Washington, D.C. and seeing how all these complex organizations work and get things done.  Those were all opportunities that, you know, I may not have actually been looking for them, but the Air Force presented them to me, and they were amazing. And, you know, that gave me the background to really figure out who I was and what my passion was. I enjoy working with really technical, complicated things. But something that I enjoy more is doing that in a, you know, in a team under a pressure situation, and in there's, you know, NASA, if you want to do that, that's, it's a place where you can find that exact challenge.  Host: Very much so. Now, this is just one career path. Now, General Wilson, I know there's a lot of different areas that you can explore in the Air Force; just in general, a lot of different skills and backgrounds that are a part of this giant team.  Stephen Wilson: Yeah. You name it, we probably have it in our Air Force, everything from public affairs officers and finance officers and communicators and maintainers and aviators and intel officers and special warfare airmen. You name it, we probably have it in our Air Force.  Host: That's amazing. So, let's get into the nitty gritty. I like to do this as part of the podcast, is get it, really into the details. We talked about organizing, training, and equipping the Air Force; what are, what is a typical day like for you, General Wilson, leading these teams and overseeing all of this? Maybe you don't have a typical day.  Stephen Wilson: There's no such thing as a typical day. I laugh, because many days my schedule will change multiple times during the day. I would say I spend a lot of time in the Pentagon, and we spend time with my counterparts in the other services, and we talk through: what's our strategy going forward, have we got the right -- we're all fighting for resources -- do I got the right resources, and not only do I have the right resources, are we spending them in the right ways? We're stewards of American taxpayer money, and we want to make sure we get the best bang for the buck out of everything we spend. So that, as we look to the future, are we designing the right force, with the right equipment, and again, I'll tell you, we spend a lot of time on the most important weapon system we have in the United States Air Force: our people.  Host: There you go. Yeah.  Stephen Wilson: And so, what are we doing to make sure they've got the right education, the right training, the right experience, they're confident and proud of what they do and personally and professionally fulfilled. Right? And if we do that, we have mission success, we have people that are, enjoy what they're doing and enjoy being a part of an amazing team that Nick just talked about. One of the things we don't talk enough about, just because we have it here is, you know, Nick's wife is also in the Air Force. So, our family members also serve, lots of them, and we move our family and kids around a lot, and they also serve an incredible, incredibly for our nation. And we don't ever thank them enough for all that they do, helping support us along the way.  Host: I know you had a lot of moves with your family. Now, I'm sure the Air Force accommodates that. Nick, I'm sure you are encountering the same things, moving around and dealing with all of the locations.  Nick Hague: Yeah, you know, Catie and I haven't moved 21 times, we moved just under 10. But we've, you know, it's been a challenge, but one of the things that makes it is, one of the things that makes it, the sacrifice worth it is that you understand what you're, you know, what are you trying to accomplish, what are you really doing with your life. And, you know, for us, we've made the decision that we wanted to be part of something bigger. We wanted to spend our lives helping others, and there's, you know, the Air Force is a great way to do that. And it's given us so many opportunities together. It's been fun to, to just watch Catie, you know, thrive and rise up in the ranks in the Air Force, and do what she does so, so amazingly well. And so, I feel fortunate to be able to be, you know, the spouse at times, but then also the service member at times. And it's been a heck of a ride.  Host: Yeah. Tell me more about the wife in the Air Force and how that translates to NASA, because you've been a part of both. What was it like being part of the Air Force, and then taking those same values, those same skills, over to NASA?  Nick Hague: It really translates really well. You know, we, you know, I just got back from a long duration mission, right? So, I was deployed for seven months, essentially. And we've done deployments together before. You know, I've stayed back and she's deployed for a year to Iraq, or we've both deployed to the Middle East, and so we've had those experiences and I think that we learned some essential skills in terms of resiliency as a family and being able to make sure that the family can thrive in that kind of situation, and that when you come back you're very sober about the challenges of re-integrating as a family and the things that you need to do over the short term and the long term to continue to have a healthy family. And so, all of those skills we picked up along the way, you know, through the service in the Air Force, and that has been invaluable in terms of being here at NASA and being able to do what I've done.  Host: Now, General Wilson, I know earlier today you were at Space Center Houston, and you gave a presentation. Next to you were a lot of different people. We talked about disciplines across the Air Force. You had a flight surgeon, you had a couple of people that were…  Stephen Wilson: We had engineers, flight surgeons, a rescue pilot, and then, two astronauts.  Host: That's right, yeah.  Stephen Wilson: And that's kind of a microcosm of our Air Force, right? These, they do lots of different things in it.  Host: That's right. So, I'm sure, you know, you've had a chance, even throughout the day, to talk with some of the airmen, some of the NASA astronauts that are also part of the Air Force. So, can you tell me about the qualities of the Air Force and what the Air Force is doing to help provide, you know, like, just like Nick, here, Air Force airmen into NASA astronauts.  Stephen Wilson: Yeah, so, as you see, every one of those who were sitting on the panel were pretty exceptional, right?  Host: Very much so.  Stephen Wilson: So, here's a payload engineer who’s designing satellites that are going to help move forward, in terms of health and medicine, on his, some of his experiments, right? And then you have a flight surgeon, who's there to make sure the whole team stays as healthy as they can be, and one of the things that he'll be looking at for long duration spaceflight. But I would say that's a microcosm of our force, right? We've got some really incredible people, and they're really passionate about service, they're passionate about making a difference, and they see this great relationship, so they have it in the Air Force and they look at a place like NASA and say I can make a difference there, too. And so they may have an assignment or two here at NASA, and they may come back to the Air Force. You know, it's, but that's a microcosm of what we got going on all over.  Host: Yeah, just a broad range of skills. There's a lot of interconnections with the Air Force and NASA. How are we working together to actually, you know, we talk about the Air Force. We're managing space. There's a lot of different directives and goals of the Air Force, where do those cross over with the…  Stephen Wilson: Well let’s just take, you know, we're talking to astronauts, but we do, we're in the launch business. So, we do lots of things in launch, but whether it be your tracking or the operations, whether it be maintaining new satellites or whether you're going to do recovery of the astronauts, right, your Air Force is involved in all of those. You know, and most people, let's just take space, there's a lot of discussion going on in space, and we take…most of the world doesn't realize that, how dependent not only our national security is, our, certainly our U.S. economy and all the scientific research and endeavor that happens because of space, that today, you know, this little constellation of GPS and how dependent we are as a nation, from the financial system to every ATM machine to cash registers around the country to all the navigation and timing and positioning that happens because of GPS. And that's a global utility being run by the United States Air Force by, honestly, today on crew, there's a small number of people that run that global utility for billions of people.  Host: Wow.  Stephen Wilson: That's what your Air Force does. But so, yes, we have some astronauts here with NASA, but we're also in the launch business, the tracking telemetry business. We're in the communication business and recovery business.  Host: And the people business. I love that theme, the people, it's all about those people. Nick, you going from the Air Force, you just mentioned you recently landed from space, it's fresh on your mind. What values from the Air Force did you take with you to space?  Nick Hague: You know, I touched on the sense of being able to work together as a team, the sense that, you know, our accomplishments, our shared accomplishments, and, you know, everything that we're doing, it's not just the six of us that are on board the space station but it's the team of a hundred thousand people spread around the globe from, you know, countries across the globe, that are making that magic happen. That's, you know, that appreciation, I think, is probably the strongest thing that you, that I took with me from my time in the Air Force, and, you know, and sort of I've, you know, I'll pile on a little bit: the, you know, human space exploration doesn't happen without what airmen bring to the fight, if you will. You know, we're up there, we mentioned GPS: the space station flies through space, and it determines its position and orientation based off GPS. The search and rescue crews are going to be there to support when we start launching out of Florida here real soon, and that's going to be an exciting time. All of our, you know, supply cargo vehicles, you know, a lot of them are coming out of the U.S., and we're providing the range support for that. So, airmen make the human exploration of space possible, and that's only going to be stronger in terms of support that we're going to need to make Artemis happen, to get back to the Moon in five years, and then to continue to push on to Mars. So, this relationship, it's, you know, it's a very, you know, you see it as, I see it as kind of this symbiotic relationship. We help each other. You know, I grew up in the Air Force, and now I'm working at NASA. And you have the ability to go back and forth, and it's just a really special relationship that we have.  Stephen Wilson: It goes back to 1959. So, we've been partnering with NASA since 1959.  Host: That's right. Yeah, it's very much interwoven, and it takes a partnership. We see it all the time. We talk about our international partners, but there's domestic partners too, and the Air Force is a bit part of, like you said, continuous space operations is a big part of it. Now, you did make that transition. Can you tell me about the application process, from going from the Air Force to NASA?  Nick Hague: So, I guess the first piece of advice is if you don't get selected, try, try again. So, it took me three applications and a decade of applying in order to get accepted. It's one of those things where you don't, you don't grow up, you know, with the end goal, the only goal, the sole goal, the passion, is to become an astronaut. You grow up having a passion to do something else, and then, in pursuing that, you realize that hey, you know, I'd also like, you know, I've got this childhood dream, or I've got this dream of becoming an astronaut. Everybody that gets selected to be an astronaut has had a career doing something else before, and they've done it successfully. And the reason that they're successful is those careers are based on this passion that they have. So, when people are looking at, you know, how to, how do I do that job one day; the key to how do you do the astronaut job one day is that you find that passion that you have, and you just pursue it relentlessly. And then, as you pursue that, you're going to do the best that you can possibly do, and that will make your chances for being selected to fly in space or to make it to space someday the highest they possibly can be. Because they're infinitesimally small. But that doesn't mean that you shouldn't stop dreaming about it and stop working hard to try to make it happen.  Host: It's true. That passion maybe is for the job, but maybe it's for the work itself, as well. It's for doing the best that you can do wherever you're doing your job.  Nick Hague: Absolutely.  Stephen Wilson: You know, we talk about that being kind of the key to success for anybody, right? To be excellent at whatever we ask you to do, to be the leader wherever you are, because there's always more work to do when you find those young leaders who take the initiative to make every place better. And I say the third piece is to be ready, because we don't know what's going to happen and we need to be ready for opportunity when it strikes, or be ready to be prepared for that unforeseen event.  Host: I think ready for the future, too, I think a large reason why you're here is, is we're thinking about that next generation. We're thinking about, you know, who's going to be coming on board next, and we want to prepare them, we want to make sure that they're ready. What is the future of the Air Force and of NASA, really? What are we looking forward to here?  Stephen Wilson: Well, let's talk a little bit about space, because we're here in the middle of the world space [inaudible]. You can just see the excitement that's happening really all around kitchen tables across America, of this, where are we going with space and the importance of space, and every place I go, I get people that either are excited about this opportunity, where you say the sky's the limit; I go, there is no limit. Look, I kind of feel like we've gone back, you know, about a hundred years, right? In the early 1910s, 1920s, as air power was just coming on board, people, you know, didn't realize what it would do. Who knew that we'd be able to fly airplanes around the globe and to the spots and speeds that we have. And now I think people are looking at that same thing for space, right? We did it 50 years ago, right, we had President Kennedy on May 25, '61, say we're going to the Moon and back, right, and we're going to get there within a decade. And in 1969 we did. And along the way, 36 launches between the Mercury, Gemini, and Apollo programs, some spectacular successes. We also had some setbacks and failures, but we were relentless as a nation to get there. And it think there's that same excitement now. People see this possibility of where we're going in space and, you know, you hear about companies putting up thousands of satellites in constellations, you know, in a global Internet, and the different sensors around the globe and how we'll do that, and to the Moon and Mars programs. I think there's just a lot of excitement about this potential that's continuing to open up right now before us.  Host: That's right. So, where are the opportunities? What are we looking forward to, what kinds of jobs, experiences, people are we looking for to get involved in space in the Air Force?  Stephen Wilson: Yes, all of that.  [Laughter]  Stephen Wilson: Because I really, I think, we don't know yet, right? But I think, just as Nick kind of talked about, we look at, there's a couple people on the International Space Station, but there's, you know, a hundred thousand support them. I'd say the same thing's true across here, right: I'm going to need people that understand how to work budgets, I'm going to need people that know how to tell the story, I'm going to need people that know how to design new satellites, new sensors, I need people who understand how to do architectures and connect them. I'm going to need all of that, yes. But, you know, the space, you know, what we say in the military is, if we lose space, we lose. Right? It's that important. As a joint force, we are totally reliant on space and the potential there.  Host: That's right. There's a lot of potential. I remember even during the panel, there was, there was someone, I think he was the engineer who was doing experiments on the space station; we're looking at those next possibilities. I don't know if you actually worked on any of those, Nick, or, I mean, just experiments in general, that's a big part of your job up in space.  Nick Hague: Yeah, I mean, the mission of the space station is science, and a lot of what we're doing up there is trying to just answer questions about, so that we know more about ourselves than the universe around us. But it was fun to see the influx of experiments that were tech demonstrations that were proving out systems that we were trying to downselect for to get back to the Moon, and figure out how we're going to develop the technology we need for the Artemis program. It's one of those things, and I'll just circle back, you know, to the, you know, who are we looking for, you know. So, I'm an example of, you know, the transition from the Air Force, and so I'd like to put a plug out there for, you know, all the airmen that are interested in space. You don't have to be a test pilot to become an astronaut, and we're looking for people that are passionate and have been successful and really have the drive to contribute to what we're going to do. And so, you know, as we look for, you know, eventually, the next class that's going to join us, or the people that we're going to end up sending to the Moon or to Mars, if you're out there, and you've, you're interested, I can't think of a more exciting time to be a part of this than right now, with everything that's going on.  Host: Yeah. And General Wilson, it sounds like you're saying the same thing, this is just an exciting time, and with that breadth of experiences, what, the theme that I'm getting from both of you is really just, it doesn't matter if you're focusing on anything in particular, just whatever is the most passionate thing, whatever you can really dive yourself into, that's what really you should focus on, and there are opportunities.  Stephen Wilson: There's some amazing opportunities, and I think, we don't even, I can't explain what they are because I don't know what they are. But I just, I see what this, I see what the potential could be, and I see where we're growing, not only in our Air Force in the space world, but, you know, we've stood up a new combatant command for space. So, General Raymond is now the 11th combatant commander for, U.S. combatant commander, and U.S. Space Command. And the president has put forward legislation that, put forward a proposal to have a sixth branch of the armed forces, the U.S. Space Force. And that's now being talked about in Congress, and we're hoping that will come out here in this National Defense Authorization Act, to be released this year. But we're working hard with Congress for this new sixth branch of the military, the U.S. Space Force.  Host: Wow. This is definitely an exciting time, and it seems like a time where there are abundant opportunities. General Wilson and Colonel Hague, thank you so much for coming on Houston, We have a Podcast today and talking about the Air Force, space, and all of the opportunities we have in the near future.

                        "description": "Gary Jordan (Host): Houston, we have a podcast. Welcome to the official podcast of the NASA Johnson Space Center, Episode 121, Apollo 17. I'm Gary Jordan. I'll be your host today. On this podcast, we bring in the experts, scientists, engineers, and astronauts all to let you know what's going on in the world of human spaceflight. We are in the middle of celebrating 50 years of the Apollo program. This summer 2019, we focused on Apollo 11, as we passed 50 years since the first landing of humans on the Moon. Just recently, we passed 50 years since Apollo 12, where Pete Conrad and Alan Bean became the next two men on the Moon on November 19th, 1969, while Richard Gordon flew solo in the command module. Not a smooth ride to get there either, as the Saturn V was famously struck by lightning during ascent on November 14th. And [Electrical Environmental Consumables, and Mechanical Systems] EECOM, John Aaron in mission control suggested switching quote [Signal Conditioning Equipment] SCE to Aux. No one quite knew what that meant, but they did it, it worked, and the crew were able to navigate to the Moon with Conrad saying “whoopee” as his first word as he exited the lunar module first onto the lunar surface. Conrad and Bean conducted two spacewalks, set up some science experiments, took color video, collected rocks and pieces of the Surveyor 3 probe that landed on the surface more than two years prior. And then they returned safely to Earth on November 24th. So, in the spirit of the 50th anniversaries, I had a chance to sit down with Dr. Harrison Schmitt recently, the lunar module pilot of Apollo 17, and the only geologist to walk on the Moon. He came to our studio to speak about the 50th anniversary of the Apollo program. But I had the chance to ask him more about his Apollo 17 mission, what is scientifically interesting about the Moon, and what we have to look forward to during the Artemis program. So, here we go. Forty seven years after his launch to walk on the Moon, Dr. Harrison Schmitt. Enjoy.  [ Music ]  Host: Dr. Schmitt, I am very honored to be speaking with you today. Thank you for joining me. We're now 50 years past this historic Apollo program. Thinking back on this momentous time in American history, I wanted to start just before you came to NASA, or even shortly after, what were some of the more interesting geological questions that you wanted to answer when looking at the Moon?  Harrison Schmitt:  Well, the Moon had long been an area of scientific fascination for geologists, as well as astronomers. And I think the main thing that we were, needed to know is how old was the surface of the Moon, how old were the rocks that we could see from using telescopes? And also, well, because, mainly because that would tell us how much of Earth history it was going to record, because the Moon has been in the vicinity of the Earth as a planet for billions of years, but we just didn't know how long that was. And so if there was one fundamental question that related directly back to the Earth, it was how old was the Moon?  Host: Now, tell me about when, when we were looking at the Apollo program, actually putting boots on the surface of the Moon, what you did to study the Moon, pick out the best locations in the more interesting geological parts of it.  Harrison Schmitt:  Well, the initial selection of landing sites was based purely on operational considerations. What were the smoothest areas that we could identify using the photography that the Lunar Orbiter unmanned satellite of the Moon had provided. The Lunar Orbiter program, and the Lunar Surveyor program, the Soft Landing program, had been in the mix even before Kennedy made his announcement. And they were programs that then were transferred over into the Apollo program office and then retargeted in order to examine those areas that might, around the equator that might be most favorable for landing. And so the first two landings were basically related to those early landing sites. And then as we got more confidence, we started to expand the landing sites until finally with Apollo 17, the mission I flew on, we landed in a valley deeper than the Grand Canyon. And only about seven kilometers wide. So, it was really a spectacular evolution of the landing site selection.  Host: It was really--establishing the confidence of the operation itself. Given that, this was a fairly new operation. You know, we were just getting to the Moon.  Harrison Schmitt:  Well, it was new, you know, in fact, people had to realize, Apollo 11 was a test flight. Nobody knew for sure that we were going to be able to land on Apollo 11. And, of course, we came close to not landing on Apollo 11. But, nevertheless, through the skill that Neil Armstrong showed, we were able to do that. And also, the knowledge that was present in Mission Control Center, we can't forget how important a role they played in the Apollo program. And you also have to keep that in mind of when you decide you're finally going to go to Mars, mission control won't be nearly as involved. There will be a planning operation, but not a real time part of the actual landings on Mars.  Host: Very true. Now, you said Apollo 11 was selected mainly because of operational constraints, making sure that we can successfully land on the Moon. That was one of the big parts of why we selected that site.  Harrison Schmitt:  Well, it was a little more complicated than that.  Host: OK.  Harrison Schmitt:  Because Apollo 8, Frank Borman, Bill Anders and Jim Lovell's mission, was targeted to the farthest east landing site that we had determined would be acceptable for Apollo. And when they were able to view that landing site using a ten power monocular, they felt very confident, Bill Anders in particularly, that it looks pretty good. And so when Apollo 10 came along, I suggested to Tom Stafford that maybe we ought to ask management to shift their landing site, one Apollo landing site, westward. So, they would have a chance to look at a second site, as well as a third site, because they were going to be in orbit longer. And we spent quite a bit of time with management trying to convince them that that was a good plan, and eventually prevailed. And so the planned landing or launch day for Apollo 10 was shifted by one day in order to see two more sites. Well, as soon as you did that, that pretty well determined where Apollo 11 was going to land. They were going to land at the targeted site for Apollo 10.  Host: Now, this site, of course, being, you know, operationally the chosen landing site for Apollo 11, what geologically was interesting about it?  Harrison Schmitt:  The main thing that was geologically interesting about Apollo 11 was gathering a broad suite of samples. And that's, indeed, what Neil did. Neil did a fantastic job. In about 20 minutes, he gave us one of the best collections of lunar rocks that we've ever gotten in a short amount of time, including the soil of the Moon. He told me later that he looked at that rock box that he was putting the rocks in, and he said it looked awfully empty, so he just filled it up with soil. Even though, you know, it's a famous number, ten zero zero eight four is the soil from the Apollo 11 site. And it's extremely important soil. Not only did we get the age, we found out the Moon was very old from the rocks that Neil brought, collected. But that soil has given us great insights into the resource base that the Moon represents, not only for lunar settlements, but also potentially for use here on Earth, namely a fuel for fusion power, light isotope of helium that is present in those soils. And then again resources that can help us go to Mars.  Host: Now, as a geologist, I'm sure you had a drive to actually put yourself on the Moon and look at all these fascinating sites from your own eyes. Tell me about your drive to go through the training for other systems; command module training, lunar module training, to become an astronaut and actually fly to the Moon as a geologist.  Harrison Schmitt:  Well, as you can gather from Deke Slayton's book “Deke,” he did not think that they needed scientist astronauts. And so the challenge in front of all of us, scientist astronauts, the six that were selected, was to become as operational pilots as they possibly could. Not only jet pilots and helicopter pilots, but also to be as good as anyone at operating the spacecraft. And so that was the challenge in front of me, that if I was ever going to have a chance to be part of a crew that went to the Moon, I would have to be as good as anybody else.  Host: Now, reflecting on specifically Apollo 11, can you tell me about where you were, where you remember being during that mission, and what were you doing?  Harrison Schmitt:  Well, most of the time, Apollo 11, I was in mission control. I had spent a great deal amount of time both with the training of the crew, with the monitoring of the configuration and packing of the descent stage, and also with the planning of the little bit of EVA activity that they were going to have, and so I spent a great deal of time, as I did for all the missions except my own, in mission control. That's where the action was. And that's, and those were the people you were going to be dependent upon once you were in space. So, I have great respect and a lot of great friends in mission control.  Host: Looking back 50 years, can you tell me your thoughts when you saw Neil Armstrong take those first steps on the Moon?  Harrison Schmitt:  Well, it was exciting for everybody. And primarily because of the patriotism. People have to remember that Apollo 11, the whole Apollo program started out initially as a part of the Cold War, the competition between Communism and the Soviet Union and democracy in the United States. And the people who signed up for Apollo, 450,000 Americans were in this primarily because of their patriotism and their belief that it was critical to the competition that then existed in the Cold War. And so it was mainly a patriotic feeling I think that we all had, particularly those of us in mission control, that the success really was what Kennedy had asked us to do, what Eisenhower had helped plan and develop technologies to do, so that we really did make a difference in the Cold War. I think we all felt that it may have made a big difference. And subsequently émigrés from the then Soviet Union made it very clear that once we had landed on the Moon, indeed, once we had launched the Saturn V, that they felt the Moon race was over.  Host: We're now 50 years past that moment. Can you tell me what you're thinking now 50 years later?  Harrison Schmitt:  Well, I feel the same way. I think not only was it extraordinarily important to the winning of the Cold War, to the collapse of the then Soviet Union, but now it offers lessons to us as we enter into a period of time where we may, and I think do have another Cold War, primarily in competition with China. And the Apollo program is an example for NASA or some other agency that may come into existence on how to compete in space, in deep space, how to manage the risks of deep space, and how to create a management environment where things can happen very, very quickly, and you can make milestones.  Host: Going back to post Apollo 11 landing, I'm sure after witnessing Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin on the Moon, you had some ideas from a geological standpoint of what was important and how to conduct science and look for the right samples. Can you tell me about some of your work moving forward from Apollo 11 to your mission, Apollo 17, where you were training other astronauts in preparing yourself for those missions?  Harrison Schmitt:  Well, all of that preparation actually began before I even applied for the astronaut program. It goes back to having been able to work with Eugene Shoemaker in the U.S. geological surveys activities that related to Apollo. They were on NASA contracts to think exactly about those issues, of not only how would you do science on the Moon, but what science would be important? In fact, I even planned a lunar traverse, hypothetical traverse, using the Ranger pictures from the Ranger program, the last image of the Moon that Ranger provided before it crashed into the Moon. I did a traverse plan was published, and was I think the first traverse plan that was ever done. And after Apollo 11, and once we knew that in broad strokes what we were dealing with in terms of the age of the Moon, the variety of lunar rocks that we might see, what may have been the evolutionary sequence of the Moon as a small planet, that then started to get everybody thinking, not only myself, but many others, about how to gather more information, more detailed information about the Moon and how it, how it relates to the Earth. Again, the Earth was our primary focus, that early history of the Earth that is obscure to us down here on Earth because of the dynamic processes that take place geologically here versus the very quiet activity of the Moon, at least in the last three and a half billion years.  Host: Now, jumping forward to Apollo 17, in what way, in what ways were you essentially practicing and studying for your mission?  Harrison Schmitt:  Well, Apollo 17 training actually began when I worked with Dick Gordon as a backup crew member for the Apollo 15 mission to the Moon. And that was really the beginning of my intense training. 15 months of training, then 15 months of training for Apollo 17. And most of that training, of course, had to do with flying the spacecraft, and carrying out the actual operational plan for the Apollo 17 mission. In addition, because of the training program that I had put together for the Apollo 13 crew, and that continued on for the other missions, we spent about a week a month actually out in the field working on geological problems, but getting used to using the equipment that we would have on the surface.  Host: Now, again, just prior to Apollo 17, you putting your own boots on the Moon, tell me about some of the top lessons and strategies you learned from some of your other fellow Apollo astronauts who previously walked on the Moon. What were they telling you on how to be successful?  Harrison Schmitt:  Well, the main thing that we learned from all the crews is that time is relentless, that you never have enough time to do what you want to do. And no matter how conservative you make the flight plan, you run out of time. It's just the way space is. And it's, in fact, it's the way life is. But it is focused and concentrated in space more than normally is the case here on Earth. And so we tried to put together flight plans, our EVA plans, particularly, that understood that you would never have enough time to do things. And for Apollo 17, because we had a geologist, a field geologist, that's very important distinction, is someone who's used to sizing up a geological situation quickly using their experience to do that, and then focusing on what appears to be important at that particular location. And so for Apollo 17, we tried to open up the timeline so I would have enough time to do that while the commander was actually doing the housekeeping part of taking care of the Lunar Rover and other things like that. And then once that was complete, then the two of us could focus as a team, and very important to work as a team, for sampling and photography and the like, on what seemed to be the best approach to gathering the most information we could from any particular station that we would stop at on Apollo 17.  Host: Now, referring back to your training, you said most of your training was, of course, for the operations of the whole thing. Focusing specifically on the lunar module, can you tell me about that experience, training in the lunar module and learning to pilot it for your mission?  Harrison Schmitt:  Well, the lunar module was a remarkable vehicle. It, of course, was designed to work in space, not in an atmosphere, it was very lightweight compared to what you would expect a spacecraft to be. Certainly anything that Buck Rogers had would not work very well on the Moon because of the mass. And so the lunar module was an extraordinary challenge. And the workers at Grumman Aircraft Corporation at the time did a remarkable job in developing it, as well as the NASA engineers who oversaw their work, and who figured out in the final analysis how to get the weight to a point, the mass of the lunar module to a point of where it could actually land on the Moon, given the kind of energy that the Saturn V had to place it there. So, it was a remarkable vehicle. It could do many things. Obviously, we used the computer. It was a very primitive computer, but one that did the job extremely well. And one thing you have to remember, that that computer was tied through telemetry to larger computers, much larger computers, IBM computers here on Earth. And so when we made a measurement using say a telescope or something like that in the lunar module, or in the Command Module, that information came back and was processed down here on Earth. And then the results of that processing was put into our guidance system in the two spacecraft. So, it was a cooperative thing between the space, between space and mission control, very important cooperative activity. One of the things, though, that for our mission that I think was unique, I know it was unique, is that we were able to figure out, I worked with the engineers who had developed the abort guidance system, which was a different kind of computer, much less precise than the primary guidance and navigation [control] system that we had, the PGNCS, but I worked with a way in which we could get an altitude update during landing, during the final approach to the surface of the Moon, get an altitude update in the abort guidance system, so that if we had to, we could probably have landed using the aboard guidance system if the primary system had failed. We didn't have to use that, but that was different about the Challenger operation than any other mission is that, with the help of these engineers, I had figured out how to get an altitude update into my computer. The aboard guidance system was a computer that I ran.  Host: Well, tell me about some of the, some of the challenges, being a geologist by training, to learn these systems, compared to some of the test pilot astronauts.  Harrison Schmitt:  Well, it turns out that test pilots and geologists are very much alike. They, they have to be good observers. They have to have a background in a wide variety of scientific disciplines. Clearly, the test pilots did not know the geological vocabulary. And so we kept that as very simple, very simple as possible. But, and clearly geologists didn't know how to, how to fly an airplane. Most of us didn't. And so that was, the main thing was to bring these two groups together using their complementary talents, and actually end up with pilots who were good field geologists, and a field geologist who was a good pilot. And that really is I think a lesson for the future is that that's the best way to operate. In fact, I would have every geologist that goes to Mars also be a jet pilot and a helicopter pilot I think is very, very important discipline, type of discipline to have learned, even though you learned it late in life.  Host: Now, jumping to you landing on the Moon for Apollo 17, tell me about your thoughts, suiting up and taking those first steps.  Harrison Schmitt:  Well, you get so focused on following the timeline, making sure that you maximize the use of the taxpayers' time that you have on the Moon, that you don't, I didn't think very much about what was going on other than to make sure that we were getting out and getting to work. And in retrospect, you file away these impressions. But I didn't stand around and say ooh and ah very much on the lunar surface. But we landed in a valley deeper than the Grand Canyon, as I said before. And it's really a magnificent place. The mountains on either side went to 1,600 on one on the north to 2,200 meters above the valley floor. It was brilliantly illuminated by the sun. But the unusual, two unusual things was that anytime you looked up into this blacker than black sky, you could see the Earth. And a really remarkable experience.  Host: Now, tell me about your, your mission priorities as a geologist. Now you said you were focused in trying to stick to the timeline. But you wanted to free up your time so that you could survey and use your eye to look at the more interesting parts. Tell me about your priorities.  Harrison Schmitt:  Well, we had, with the help of many people, had put together what turns out to be an excellent plan using the limited photography we had of the landing site. Today, of course, we have Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter images of the landing site, which are, if we had had them at the time, you stand back and say, “would I have changed the flight plan?” Well, actually, it turns out, I don't think I would have, based even on the information we have today. But we have learned so much from the samples and the photography that we've just been able to enhance and grow from the information that we collected. But, and the priorities that we had established for the Apollo 17 mission was to take advantage of that three dimensional situation we were in to sample boulders that had rolled off these high mountains, to look at an avalanche deposit that had come off of one of them. And the whole area seemed to be covered by some dark material that we had thought would be volcanic ash. Turns out it was, but we did not expect in one of the great discoveries of Apollo 17 was to actually find a deposit, a relatively undisturbed deposit of this volcanic ash, the so called orange soil. It is actually orange and black. Most of it was black, but the top part of it was orange. And that discovery has turned out to be one of the primary discoveries related to the Moon and the Earth in that it tells us more about the origin of the Moon. It tells us about the presence of volatiles and indigenous water inside the Moon. And it tells us about the processes by which these, what we call pyroclastic volatile driven eruptions occur on the Moon. Anybody who watched the news about Hawaii knows what a pyroclastic eruption looks like. A very violent kind of thing. On the Moon, that has happened in 1/6th gravity. And so they're even more spectacular, or were more spectacular three and a half billion years ago.  Host: Yeah. You know, looking back at that time, looking at all these different samples, is there a particular moment you remember retrieving a sample or something you, maybe something unexpected that you remember doing in one of your EVAs?  Harrison Schmitt:  Well, almost every sample was unexpected because we couldn't see that resolution. And so you pick a place where you think you're going to find something interesting, and indeed, every place we picked did have things that were interesting. And I mentioned the orange soil, the volcanic ash that we discovered. That probably was the highlight of at least that particular EVA, the second EVA. But every mission, and I continue to work on these samples, and the work, and not so much on the samples, but what other people have done to analyze the samples and try to synthesize that information into a more, into a coherent picture of what actually happened on the Moon, and how it relates to the origin of the Moon, and indeed, to the history of the Earth.  Host: So, tell me about the, some of the other experiments that were happening during Apollo 17. There was a, there was a light flash experiment looking at cosmic rays, gravimeters, some of these other experiments.  Harrison Schmitt:  We had a wide variety of geophysical experiments that we put out on the Moon. We deployed an active seismic experiment, which were actually charges of the largest one was about six pounds of TNT equipment we deployed these. And they were activated, of course, after we left, and not before. I had, I deployed almost all of them, and I had to pull three-- pins to activate timers that would allow them to be exploded 90 hours after they were activated. And so there was plenty of margin there. But still, you have six pounds of TNT in your hand, and you're pulling pins on it, that's an interesting psychological thing to be doing. We also had a traverse gravimeter experiment. So, we measured the lunar gravity at every site where we stopped. And then some. That information has been refined recently using the laser altimetry from the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter spacecraft, so that it is even better now than it was when we gathered it. Same, same data, but it's been refined using that new information. We also had a lunar surface gravimeter, just a steady gravimeter that was designed to measure what's called the free oscillations of the Moon. The Earth and the Moon both have free oscillations if they're activated by an earthquake or a moonquake. But also they would be activated by gravity waves coming by. So, it was the first real attempt to measure gravity waves, to see if gravity waves really existed. We now know that they do. That's been a very important experiment that that's been conducted here on Earth. But at the time, the idea was to use the Earth and the Moon as a big oscillator in space. And so if a gravity wave went by, it would activate both of them at the same time. That, unfortunately, that experiment did not work. But, nevertheless, the idea was there, an extremely important idea to try to verify Einstein's hypotheses about gravity.  Host: Right. Now, a lot of these experiment, you're saying, understanding more about the Moon helps us to understand Earth, which is extremely important. There's some physics aspects to what you're studying. Can any of this be applied to future exploration knowing what it would be like to, if we were to live on the Moon for extended period of times, any of this data relevant to maybe those missions in the future?  Harrison Schmitt:  The main data that we have now about the Moon that's relevant to future settlements, future activities on the Moon, is that that comes from the soils, the lunar soils, because those soils have been gathering the resources of the Moon that are put out as part of the solar wind. There's hydrogen, there's nitrogen carbon principally. And with hydrogen, you can always make water and extract oxygen then from the rocks themselves. So, for the future, our primary knowledge that we have gathered has been from the soils of the Moon. And as I indicated earlier, there is a light isotope of helium called Helium 3 that is the only resource that we know about on the Moon that potentially can be of great value here on Earth. It is an ideal fuel for fusion power, produces no radioactive residuals of any kind, but produces electrical power at very high efficiency when fused with itself, or with the heavy isotope of hydrogen called deuterium. So, we have two great discoveries based on really what Neil Armstrong sampled as ten zero zero eight four, that soil that he filled up the rock box with, and that we know that we have resources that can support us when we decide to live on the Moon, and when we decide to go to Mars, and a single resource that may be of extraordinary value here on Earth, particularly as we try to wean ourselves from fossil fuels.  Host: Jumping back to your Apollo 17 mission, you spent three days on the surface. Can you tell me about actually living beyond the work itself? Did you establish a routine, or what was it like to actually live there for a few days?  Harrison Schmitt:  There's almost never any routine when you're on the Moon. Something always happens that disrupts the plan. For one thing, right, as soon as we, almost as soon as we landed, when we were having our first meal, well, the compartment where the meals were stored opened up, and the pressure from the atmosphere, the pressure in the bags had put enough pressure on the door of that compartment that when we opened it up, all the meals came out into the cabin. So, we had to figure out a way to stuff all that back into the cabin. Also, you never can really experience 1/6th G continuously without being there. In fact, that's the essential ingredient of the excitement of being on the Moon is being there. You can't transfer that to you or to anybody else. You have to go there yourself. So, I hope you have that opportunity someday. But we of course knew how to swing our hammocks for sleep in the lunar. But until you actually do that and get in them, you don't realize how comfortable 1/6th gravity can be. I slept extremely well on the Moon. I'd wake up about every two hours and listen to make sure that the fans and the pumps were all still running. You don't want complete silence on the Moon, believe me. And then I'd go back to sleep. So, I slept very well. I can't speak for the commander, I can't, or anyone else, but I slept very well on the Moon.  Host: It's almost like the routine was adaptability really just going with the--    Harrison Schmitt:  That's the essence of being a human being, is being able to adapt.  Host: Tell me about, particularly on your mission, you traveled pretty far in the Lunar Rover, the LRV. Can you tell me some of the advantages you had driving that distance, and really expanding your reach on the Moon?  Harrison Schmitt:  Well, there was a great debate before the Lunar Rover was finally picked as a system for use on the Moon. Between having a driving machine and having a hopping machine. And that was an interesting debate. Chemists tend to favor hopping from place to place, because they just want a sample here and a sample there, sample there. A field geologist wants to see the context as you approach a particular sample site. You want to see how does everything else fit into that particular place. So, that debate went on among geologists and engineers as well. And Max Faget, who was the chief engineer down here at the manned spacecraft center, now Johnson Space Center, it, he finally just asked one question. He says, “how are you going to train to use a hopper?” And that pretty well settled that. It was going to be very difficult. We had been going through the lunar landing training vehicle experience for three, including Neil Armstrong, had to bail out of that machine, it was a very difficult thing to train with. The lunar module pilots finally were not trained in that because just the difficulties of using it. And so Max had a great deal of influence on whether we had a Lunar Rover or Lunar Hopper. Now, the Lunar Rover itself worked very well. We could go at about 10 or 12 kilometers an hour over most of the terrain that we drove on. It could, we drove up a 20 degree slope to get to Station 6, the big boulder there. So, it performed extremely well. It never, we never had any problem. There were little glitches on the other two missions, but we had never had any noticeable problem. The Boeing people, the Marshall people, the General Motors people all did a wonderful job in building, designing and building that particular vehicle. It really made a great deal of difference. The main contribution I think I made to operations of the Lunar Rover while for Apollo 17, was to develop a Rover sampler, which was basically a nested set of what we call Dixie cups. In a sampler, we could put on one of the extension handles. And I wouldn't have to get off in order just to get a soil sample, or a small rock sample, just by reaching down. And those samples have turned out to be extremely valuable because they give a lot more context between stations of how were these soils of the area changing as we approached different sites.  Host: So, and you were able to do that because of the distance you can cover with the Rover.  Harrison Schmitt:  Yeah, no question about it. We covered a total of about 32 kilometers with the Rover. The farthest we went away from the lunar module Challenger was about seven kilometers out to Station 2 at the base of the South Massif. It was the highest mountain in the area.  Host: Now, one of the things you mentioned about looking out onto the surface of the Moon, you mentioned the blackness of the sky, but you also mentioned that you can see the Earth. Can you tell me about seeing the Earth from the Moon, and some of your thoughts there?  Harrison Schmitt:  I can't really tell you. You've got to go there. [Laughter] It's always in the same part of the sky because the Moon, as the Moon goes around the Earth, it keeps the same face towards the Earth. And so the Earth is always in the same part of the sky. If you're right in the center of the Moon, it's going to be directly above you. It was a little bit, it was down below that point a little bit for us. It was always over this high mountain, the South Massif. And so seeing that was really a remarkable experience in that black sky. And it's primarily blue with white clouds, patterns that we're familiar with. And the one thing that stands out on the Earth are the large desert areas, such as Australia, for example. Stands out almost as an orange beacon, even from the distance of the Moon, 250,000 miles from where we were.  Host: Reflecting on Apollo 17, can you tell me about your crewmates, Gene Cernan and Ron Evans?  Harrison Schmitt:  Outstanding crewmates. I think I can say that for all the crews. For the most part, they worked together extremely well. Once assigned to a mission, they approached it very professionally. Not many of them were close friends, I don't think, afterwards. I think the Apollo 12 crew was probably a good example of very close friends. But most of the people, just they were professional that came together as a crew, worked extremely well, and did extraordinarily great jobs on each of the missions. Now, Ron Evans I think probably knew the command module America better than anybody had ever known the command module. I was really very impressed with what Ron could do. He, and, of course, he had to spend three days alone in orbit around the Moon, but in that process, operated a wide variety of remote sensing instruments, as well as kept prepared in order to receive us should we have to leave the Moon in a hurry.  Host: Jumping to after Apollo 17, returning, you know, you were conducting all of these experiments, and you've already mentioned some of the findings from some of those experiments, some of the things you've discovered from doing geological surveys on the Moon. But can you tell me some of the things, some of the other highlights of the things you learned during your stay?  Harrison Schmitt:  Well, just recently, we've been able to take the nitrogen isotopes that are in the deep core of the, that we obtained on Apollo 17, take the data from those nitrogen isotopes and look like we have found a major change in solar activity just about 500 million years ago. We're still working on that. But it looks like something strange happened to the sun. It increased its luminosity, the amount of energy that was coming from the sun. About 500 million years ago. And one of the interesting things is on Earth, that's when there was this explosion of life. We call it the Cambrian explosion about 550 million years ago. And most people said that was because the Earth was warmer. Well, maybe it was warmer because the sun changed its way of operating. That's the kind of thing we're working on right now today. And it's made possible, in large part, because of the advance of analytical technology. What we do today compared to what we could do 50 years ago with these samples is almost night and day. It's really amazing. It's like the discovery of water in the ash, the orange ash that I sampled. That was done first in 2008. We never, we thought up until that time that the Moon was bone dry, that there was no water. We knew there were other volatiles, but no water. Well, now we know there's water inside the Moon. And that, in turn, standards to open up your thinking about what about the ice that we think we've discovered at the poles of the Moon? Is that old water that came out as volcanic eruptions, or is it new water that's been formed by some other process? We're having a lot of exciting times in the lunar science community right now.  Host: And that, that brings up a good point, is even after your mission, you've still stayed very connected to studying the Moon and trying to uncover its secrets. Can you tell me a little bit about that, your continuing involvement with science on the Moon?  Harrison Schmitt:  Well, I've tried, since I left the United States Senate, I've tried to get back in the game, so to speak, and I give a paper two or three a year at various science conferences. And I try to publish also just recently two years ago, my colleagues and I published a paper called “Revisiting Apollo,” Taurus-Littrow, the Apollo 17 landing site. And we didn't get all the way through that revisit, but that's still in work. There are other papers now that they're drafting and trying. But the main thing I've tried to do is synthesize everything that other people have done. And that is a very exciting thing to do. I don't-- I’m also involved in one of the sample analysis teams that's going to look at these samples that have never been opened that NASA has recently decided they would open. Core 2 from our Station 3, Apollo 17 Station 3 on, on the-- that large avalanche that I mentioned. That I'm working with the University of New Mexico scientist Chip Shearer who will be the lead of our team. It will be a multidisciplinary investigation of these unopened samples. So, that's an exciting thing to do as well.  Host: It's quite amazing about how many, you know, all these samples we collected from Apollo that we still continue to investigate and find out new things along the way. Why do you think that is? Is it a little bit because of technology, or why do you think we are continuing to learn?  Harrison Schmitt:  Well, it's several things. It's, technology certainly is giving us new tools. But people have learned a lot. They're thinking differently. They come up with new ideas and the like. I think it's a combination of that. And it's been extremely active community for 50 years. And there's no indication that it's not going to be active for another 50 years at least. Again, people have said that the samples are the gift that keeps on giving. And there's no question that that's the case.  Host: Now, you were there when President Trump signed Space Policy Directive 1. Can you tell me about that experience?  Harrison Schmitt:  Well, it was great to see the president take personal responsibility for getting us back into deep space. The vice president certainly has played a tremendous role in that effort. The reactivation of the National Space Council is very important. They also now have a user advisory group on which I serve, as well as a number of other people from around the country. And so it's a very active policy time right now. The big question is can NASA reorganize itself so it can actually carry out that directive? And we don't know the answer to that yet. NASA is not the NASA of Apollo. It's older. It's more bureaucratic. And it has its own heritage that it has to either, let's say it has to deal with. And so we're still waiting to see whether now NASA can implement a very aggressive program that was recently put forward by the vice president on behalf of the president that we get boots on the Moon again by 2024. And that's extremely important we do that. As I indicated earlier, we're in another Cold War that I think the administration does recognize that, and it's important that we be not only a competitor in that effort, but also that we succeed and are successful in that effort.  Host: And that is a bold claim. Boots on the Moon by 2024. Part of that plan is to move forward to a sustainable presence. Right now, I think the goal is 2028 to have a sustainable presence on the Moon. Can you tell me about what a sustainable presence on the Moon would mean from a geological perspective? What are the benefits of doing that?  Harrison Schmitt:  Well, if you establish yourself in a sustained base or settlement, I like to think of a settlement, not only to harvest the energy resources of the Moon, the Helium 3, but to, as byproducts, have the resources necessary to go onto Mars. Then geologically, you're going to learn about another planet eventually. Namely, Mars. But also it provides a base of operations for the exploration of the Moon. You don't have to always launch from Earth to explore a new part of the Moon. You can launch from that base to go to anywhere on the Moon really and conduct those geological studies. The main thing that studying the Moon gives us about the Earth, one of the things we already have, and that is we know now that the early history of the Earth was extremely violent. There were major, huge impacts happening not only on the Moon, but on the Earth. And at the same time, though, life was getting a start. The complex molecules were getting organized, and ultimately became replicating molecules that led us to life. And the more we can understand the Moon in that period of time, the better we're going to understand the origins of life here on Earth.  Host: Well, looking forward to going back to the Moon, or sorry, forward to the Moon. What are some of the more interesting places? Do you have some locations in mind of what would be probably more interesting to explore or to, like you said, settle?  Harrison Schmitt:  Well, the largest basin on the Moon, the largest impact produced basin on the Moon, is almost certainly about 3,200 kilometers in diameter. It's called the Procellarum basin. That's continental in scale here on Earth. That would cover the entire United States. The one basin that everybody agrees occurred is 2,500 kilometers in diameter, also continental in scale, and it may be in these very large basins we have the origin of the continents. We don't know that yet, but that's a possibility, that a variety of things happen in order to see the continents after these large basins formed. The main issue I think, though, is to start to sample the materials of these basins. And the one large basin that I mentioned, 3,200 kilometers in diameter, Procellarum, is so old that it's going to be very difficult to know that that's what you're sampling. In fact, I think we've already gotten samples from Procellarum, but that's a different story. That, the geologic context of Procellarum is going to be very difficult. Whereas South Pole-Aitken, the other basin, 2,500 kilometers in diameter, is still well defined. And if we do our planning right, I think we can not only learn about the materials produced by such large impacts, but we may actually be able to get samples of the lunar mantle from the center of that crater. That crater floor is 12 kilometers below the mean lunar radius. So, it's a very deep basin, as well as a very large basin. And that probably right now is the site, the South Pole-Aitken is where I and most other people I think would like to go. And that's where the Chinese have landed, by the way. They're not, they're not very far behind us in that respect.  Host: It's an interesting place, for sure. So, a sustainable presence. Can you tell me about what that opens up to the scientific community? I think you've already mentioned sample returns, more sample returns, possibly better technology. What does this open up?  Harrison Schmitt:  Well, having a base on the Moon, again, gives you access to the entire Moon, scientifically. It also, though, allows you to look at things in situ that is in place. For example, we cannot produce a simulate of lunar soil here on Earth that is a true simulate. We can produce certain aspects of it and learn from those aspects. But you cannot produce a two simulate because those, the lunar soils are forming in a vacuum. That is as hard as deep space vacuum. Ten to the minus 12 torr if you're into the nomenclature of vacuums. It is really impossible not to be able to understand the processes that are operating in the lunar environment without being there and actually working in situ, in place, with those materials. So, that's probably one of the major things. And also we're just now starting to understand how the history of the sun can be deciphered from the lunar soils. And that's going to be difficult. But I think we're now finally, we've talked about it for well over 50 years, that the Moon is recording the history of the sun. And now, though, we're finally, with the data we have, with the analytical techniques that we have, beginning to understand what we ought to be looking for. But getting more pages out of that history book from different parts of the Moon is going to be extremely important if we really want to understand the long term history of the sun.  Host: Now, aside from the physical science, the geological science of the sustainable presence on the Moon, what else is important for establishing that presence?  Harrison Schmitt:  I think the main thing that's important is for it to have an economic reason to exist. And that's where this Helium 3 fusion power comes in. If, indeed, Helium 3 fusion can be developed here on Earth as a commercially viable source of electrical power, then a settlement on the Moon has an economic reason to exist. And I feel actually confident that that's going to happen someday. But, still, that needs to be established, and needs to be explored. And people are now looking at that very, very seriously. The technology is advancing to, that is related to Helium 3 fusion. That's a very important thing, because I don't think you'll do much with it until you know for sure that there's a commercially viable fusion reactor. Helium 3 is very rare here on Earth. It's only produced by the decay of tritium that, and that is tritium that's used in nuclear weapons. It has a half-life of 13 years, approximately. And so every 13 years or so, you have to clean up these weapons. And that's the source of Helium 3. Helium 3 is also very important in use in neutron detectors. The Homeland Security Department uses it. And, in fact, it's tied up most of the supply in order to be able to have detectors in our borders that can look for nuclear materials, clandestine nuclear materials coming into the country. So, there are a lot of challenges in developing Helium 3 fusion. But I think those can all be met in the long term. And that will probably be a sustaining economic reason to have a settlement, and maybe ultimately an independent settlement. Jefferson always used to say a little revolution is important every once in a while. And taxation of a lunar settlement without representation might just trigger that small revolution. And we would have a little settlement at another birth of freedom, if you will, on the Moon.  Host: Now, you've been a NASA astronaut. You've been close to the scientific community, especially studying the Moon, for years now. Can you tell me about, from your perspective, the benefits of human space exploration? Why is it important?  Harrison Schmitt:  It's important geopolitically for the United States to be very active in deep space. It's important from a humanistic point of view to continue to challenge, for the human species to continue challenge itself against the frontiers, as it always has. I think it's in our DNA to move into new areas, find new resources, new ways of sustaining our civilization. Those were probably the two most important things. One, geopolitical. And two, the continuation of the exercise of the human spirit against new frontiers.  Host: Now, I want to end on a little bit more of a fun note. Do you have any tips and tricks as a lunar explorer yourself for the future lunar astronauts?  Harrison Schmitt:  Well, the main thing that you need to realize is working in 1/6th gravity is a lot of fun. I only weighed 1/6th of my total weight, including the spacesuit and a backpack and everything and I weighed 62 pounds. And so the suit is encumbering. We need much better suits. And I hope that NASA begins to invest in those suits very vigorously. But, nevertheless, the A7LB that we had for Apollo 17 worked extremely well. And remember that in 1/6th gravity, the whole surface is like a giant trampoline. It's like walking on such a trampoline.  Host: Dr. Schmitt, I very much appreciate your time today. It was an honor to talk to you. Thank you very much.  Harrison Schmitt:  It's my pleasure. Thank you.  [ Music ]  Host: Hey, thanks for sticking around.

                        "description": "Gary Jordan (Host): Houston, we have a podcast. Welcome to the official podcast of the NASA Johnson Space Center, Episode 124, “The Human Element.” I'm Gary Jordan. I'll be your host today. On this podcast, we bring in the experts, scientists, engineers, astronauts, all to let you know what's going on in the world of human spaceflight. So, this is part two of our six-part series on the Human Research Program. So far, you've heard an overview of the five elements of the Human Research Program and the massive coordinated effort it takes to discover the best methods and technologies to support safe, productive human space travel. Today, we're going to focus on the human factors and behavioral performance element, the element responsible for identifying and mitigating human factors and behavioral performance risks that come along with living and working in space, and of course, returning safely to Earth, human factors being the integration of human and machine in a sense, and behavioral performance being to maximize what astronauts can do in space. So, going into the details of this element is Aaron Allcorn, Element Manager, and Dr. Thomas Williams, Element Scientist. Dr. Thomas Williams goes by Tom. Each element of the Human Research Program has an Element Manager that handles the project costs and schedules and the technical work and the resources and also has an Element Scientist, the individual responsible for integrating and coordinating the science. So, here we go, the ins and outs of the human factors and behavioral performance element with Aaron Allcorn and Dr. Tom Williams. Enjoy.  [ Music ]  Host: Aaron and Tom, thanks so much for coming on the podcast today, to talk about human factors and behavioral performance. I'm curious to find out what this is all about. Thanks for coming.  Aaron Allcorn: Thank you. It's great to be here.  Tom Williams: Great. Thank you. It's very good to be here.  Host: I wanted to start with more of your background, because, I mean, if you're thinking about this particular element, when it comes to Human Research Program, I say human factors and behavioral performance -- I bet you a lot of people are like, \"OK, I don't know what's that all about.\" So, let's kind of set some context in what you guys have done in the past. Aaron, we'll start with you.  Aaron Allcorn: Well, I think you'll find the side variety of backgrounds and skills throughout our element. Starting with me, I think my primary role in the project, in the element is to be picked for project management. So, that's my primary background. I'm an engineer by schooling, and I've been at JSC for about 20 years, a lot of that time in Operations and most recently, I got the opportunity to work with the Human Research Program, and I'm really enjoying it.  Host: Alright. So, as your engineering background, and I think this is going to come into play when we start talking about particularly the human factors part of things, is -- and correct me if I'm wrong, if I'm saying this the way I'm interpreting this -- is human factors is more of that integration and adding the human element to whenever you're thinking about how to design a machine.  Aaron Allcorn: Correct.  Host: OK. So, that's perfect. So, you have that engineering background. Tom, what about you?  Tom Williams: You know, I'm a clinical psychologist by training, and bring to that the operational experiences that I had through multiple years in support of commanders on the ground and in support of military operations. So, kind of a melding between the science and the operational applications. How do we make the science operationally relevant so that we can better understand how that human system integration works, what are the risk factors associated with spaceflight, to include the behavioral performance and cognitive changes that may come about as a result of spaceflight, how the team processes in cooperation and coordination go together, and how sleep's circadian rhythms may change as a result of that, and then how does the human factors come together. So, how do we identify how these multiple behavioral health and performance factors may impact on our ability to carry out the tasks that need to be done on a spaceflight.  Host: It's all about achieving that objective?  Tom Williams: Exactly.  Host: Making sure that the human is going to be able to do that. I should say, Tom, welcome back to the podcast booth, because we've done this before. We talked about -- we went through those hazards of human spaceflight, and you talked about isolation and confinement specifically. Is that a part of this story, that we're going to be talking about today, with the human factors and the behavioral performance?  Tom Williams: It is, indeed. And it relates to how, when we're in isolation and confinement, how the brain may change, how the social relationships may change, how the individual adapts to that less sensory stimulation that all of us get each day as we interact with our environment and with multiple other people, and you lose some of that on a spaceflight, confined inside a spacecraft. So, how does that start to impact on you, and how can we find ways to reduce that impact, to maintain a sustained level of performance, so that we can return the crew safely back home, as we -- after we sent them off on an exploration mission.  Host: OK. Let's dive deep into what this element is all about. Aaron, I'll toss to you. What is human factors and behavioral performance? When you're looking at your organization, what is this all about?  Aaron Allcorn: I think our goal is to make sure that the human, that is only one of the systems that's going to Mars, we want to make sure that human system is capable of performing to tasks that we need, to have mission success when we get there and safety return. And so, that’s the difference from coming from an operational world. You know, we know we have the technology. We can put a spacecraft on Mars. The challenge for our element is to -- and the other elements that are HRP are, you know, what are the considerations for a human that's going to be traveling that distance?  Host: Yeah, it's more -- yeah, I guess it's performance-based, and in both cases, right? Both with the human factors and behavioral performance. It's about maximizing the capabilities of what that human can do when the harsh confined whatever you call it environment of space, that they'll be able to succeed, that they'll be able to pull that mission off.  Aaron Allcorn: Right.  Host: So, how does that work, then? What is it exactly that you're looking at in the organization and doing, to oversee that, to oversee that performance?  Aaron Allcorn: I talk just from a high level. So -- and other elements are similar in this, but we -- our first step is to identify the risks that we think the -- you know, Tom talked about the hazards before. What are the risks inherent in those hazards that would keep us from completing our mission? So, understanding those risks, it would be the first step. And then, coming up with ways to mitigate those risks. So, we build our project plans and HRP around those things -- identifying, mitigating, putting counter-measures in place that will allow us to reduce or minimize that impact, so that we are -- we're go for flight, when it comes time to go to Mars.  Host: So, Tom, what are the risks when it comes to behavior performance? What are the risks that we're looking at?  Tom Williams: Well, the three big ones that we focus on in the crew health and performance are the cognitive behavioral changes that may come about as a result of the exposure to the five spaceflight hazards that you identified in your previous podcast, and that would include the cognitive changes with regard to the brain that may be impacted, not only by the isolation and confinement, but also by radiation effects that may alter some of the brain, and we're investigating that aspect. Another of the risks include the team risk, the sleep and circadian risk, the risk for human automation and robotic integration. So, we expect more autonomous automated systems on board spacecraft in the future. So, how do we ensure that the humans on board trust those automated systems that may be necessary for more autonomous long duration missions? We also have a human-computer interface risk that we look at, in terms of how do we ensure that the human, in reading the displays, knows what display to activate at which time and keeping it from being confusing, like opening up a brochure of a new piece of electronics and trying to figure out exactly what switch do you turn on for which activity? But we need to make sure that the crew is trained on that, and that the interface they have is appropriate to that outcome that they're seeking. The other is on looking at the mission processes and tasks that they would be expected to do. How do we ensure that they're trained in the appropriate way to carry out which mission processes at which time, and that also includes giving them meaningful tasks for the duration of the mission. So, if they're on a long duration mission, rather than sitting idle for long periods of time, how do we identify which training might be provided at which time, to get them ready for the demands that would be placed upon them, up on landing on a planetary surface like either the Moon or Mars. And then, we also look at occupant protection and dynamic loads. So, on launch, the crew experience certain G-forces and on landings, they'll experience G-forces. How do we predict what the human body can take, so that after a long period in microgravity or altered gravity, where they may have experienced some bone loss, how do we ensure that the dynamic load on that bone does not cause an increased risk of a fracture or some other injury to the crew member, just from the landing forces alone?  Host: So, it's -- I'm seeing -- I'm starting to see why the human factors and behavioral performance are really linked together. When I think about human factors, I think about it as -- I think occupant protection is a great example of that, because yes, it's performance, but it's -- there's a lot of safety components to that too, making sure that yeah, they'll be able to perform their tasks, but they're not going to get hurt, and that you have to account for the human in that aspect, in that way. But the performance, it seems like it's more making sure that, especially on long duration missions -- and that was something that I really took away from that, was you really have to keep them occupied. I know we talked about this last time, when we talked about the hazard of isolation and confinement, but really making sure that brain is stimulated. They seem like very different things, right? They seem like a safety component and the stimulation and making sure that you're going to be able to do your tasks, but I can start to see how they're really related. Is that why these elements -- or I guess, these two things -- this human factors and behavioral performance -- are combined in this element?  Tom Williams: Yes, that's great. That's--  Host: OK, so Aaron, with your engineering experience, when you came into this role as the manager overseeing the -- it seems like it's more human related, it's more science related? Maybe that's not something that you worked on in the past. I think you were fluid systems engineer. So, you were definitely in the system component. Right?  Aaron Allcorn: Right.  Host: So, what surprised you when you started thinking about more of the human aspects of things?  Aaron Allcorn: Well, really what excites me is the human part of this. One of my favorite stories to tell is my first day in the Human Research Program, and one of our external investigators came in and gave the status of some of the research that he was doing and talked about how not only was his findings going to help protect our crew members on long duration missions, but he also has a clinical practice and how he was using those things that he had learned from our research to change how he was treating patients clinically that very day. So, that's one of the really -- one of the things that really excites me about this, is that the human part of that system and how do we make sure that we keep our crew members safe, who we all know and love and work with daily around here, how do we make sure that they're successful in their mission, and they come back, and they have no long-term impacts from their long duration spaceflight.  Host: That's interesting. It's not just a spaceflight thing. It's very much integrated into things that other doctors and professionals are doing, just around the world, that can be integrated in I guess whatever way that makes sense to them, but even with that isolated and confined environment that we're talking about. It translates to earthly things, in a way.  Aaron Allcorn: I think it's an important aspect of our research, is that it's not -- you know, we have a number of experts here at JSC that carry these things out, some of the research that's done locally, but we rely on experts across the country, universities and companies across the country, to help provide that research.  Host: So, Tom, let's go back in time for a bit, and take a look at why this is something that is important to NASA, to look at human factors and behavioral performance and incorporate it? We touched on it a lot, but have we seen in the past that has really opened our eyes into dedicating a whole element to it?  Tom Williams: Well, part of what we learned from several different spaceflights -- for example, on Apollo 13, the problem-solving and the team coming together, both on the ground and in the spacecraft, that solving the complex problem of how to get the [Carbon Dioxide] CO2 scrubber working again and the importance of identifying what exactly did the crew have available and how could they leverage that to solve problems. Because part of what our element focuses on is the problem-solving that a team needs to do and how does the team work together in solving a problem, so that you don't get one person who's trying to force a solution, when you're getting the input from the divergent thinking that would be possible from all the team members. And so, part of what we need to be able to do is to look at, if we don't have the ready access to Mission Control on a long duration mission, because of the distance and the time, because of communication delays that would be involved in the great distances, how do you train the crew to solve problems? So, that's one of the things that we've learned from looking at past missions, is we are heavily dependent upon mission control to solve problems. How do we design processes on board now and looking into the future, to make that link. The other thing we looked at is how the -- just the spaceflight environments may impact on crew and how they get along and how much -- how many times do we see conflict mentioned in some of their journals? And then, noting where do we see rises in mentions of conflict between crew members and looking at that across a six-month mission, and then projecting, would we see that continue to increase long-term, if it was a nine-month mission to get to Mars, and then how would we introduce counter-measures to reduce some of that risk. And also, on the human factors side, looking at how does the crew member interact with the spacecraft, and how do we make sure that the displays are appropriate to when they need to activate something that may be critical in an emergency situation. So, how do we ensure the crew -- number one, is trained? So, some of what we look at is how well does the training now get reflected in their processes, and then how well are they able to respond to demands or requirements and looking at past instances helps us look into the future.  Host: It seems pretty difficult, from what you're describing, to research this, in a way. Because when I'm -- you know, I think -- we talk about data a lot. We talk about numbers. We talk about readings and certain things. The way you're describing this, Tom, is a lot of these data are anecdotal in nature. They're journal entries. They're feelings. It's a different way of observing data. So, how do you take these and turn it into a solution for the future?  Tom Williams: That's a great question, and that is a challenge, any time you're dealing with people. You know, and sometimes, when I'm talking with engineers, I'll remind them that in quantum theory, there are subatomic particles known as quarks, and we've never seen a quark. And every time they attempt to measure it, it changes. And we say, sort of in a play on words, that in that same sense, people are kind of quarky. They change when we try to measure them. So, how do we then assess -- given those changes, given their sometimes not always willingness to share with us exactly what they're experiencing -- how do we get to the ground truth, to then develop the counter-measures? Part of the way we do that is to work with analogs on the ground and try to select crew who are very similar to the astronauts, people who share common backgrounds. So, the same age range of 30 to 55, a STEM background, a science, technology, and engineering or mathematics background. And then, put them in situations that we think would be similar to what the crew would experience. Not entirely, because they're not going to be in altered gravity, but to get a controlled setting, where we're able to assess how are they responding to stress. And we look at them repeatedly over time, look at their biomarker changes, look at performance changes. So, we're trying to integrate all that information. How are they reporting what they're experiencing? How are the blood biomarkers changing? How is their performance being altered at those times? To give us the potential, in the future, to look only at performance. So, if we can start to align a biomarker change with a self-report change on stress to an actual performance change, that gives us the opportunity to have the crew only perform some task to give an indication to them of their level of readiness to carry out some other task that may be more critical to the safety of the mission.  Host: This is a good lead-in to start talking about some of the things that this element in particular is doing to research these ideas. We talked about behavioral performance and some of the things that we're looking at. But what is it that we're actively doing in the element, Aaron? What is your organization doing to actually tackle some of these problems?  Aaron Allcorn: Well, Tom mentioned the analogs that we do. That's a big part. And one thing that maybe is different in our element than some of the other ones, we have a lot of -- so, we have the HERA, the Human Exploration Research Analog. I stumbled across that. [Laughter]  Host: There's so many acronyms.  Aaron Allcorn: Yes. Here at JSC, so that's one analog that we use. It's like a miniature spacecraft, and like Tom said, we'll have people in there, crew members that will participate in a relatively short duration mission. But we can observe them there, and so we try to do what's most cost-effective, I guess. We have that as an analog. We have -- we've used a DLR analog in Germany [Facility at the German Aerospace Center] and an NEK [Facility for Russia’s Institute for Biomedical Problems] analog in Russia and of course, a number of things that are done on [International Space Station] ISS, as well.  Host: So, we'll see in one of the upcoming elements, there's the management of these resources that is a different element, the research operations and integration, but when it comes to you guys, in behavioral performance, human factors, it's more of working maybe with the researchers to identify or come up with the questions or come up with the investigations. What it is that you want to do in these analogs? Is that what you guys are doing?  Aaron Allcorn: Right. So, that's back to -- looking at -- understanding the underlying condition. Then we identify what we call our gaps in the research, and then that's maybe more on Tom's side, with the science team looking at what is the state of our current knowledge, where do we need to get to in that, in order to feel comfortable sending somebody on this mission. So what gap remains? And then, we'll structure research announcements around those remaining gaps.  Host: So, Tom, when it comes to the science itself, what are you doing in-house and who are you working with, to actually conduct the science?  Tom Williams: We've got a number of different researchers that we work with, but I'll share a couple of really sort of interesting ones that we're working on getting ready to go for an exploration mission. So, we have one, seven different [Principal Investigator] PIs integrated into what we call a human capabilities assessment for autonomous missions, and HCAAM, for short. So, what we're looking at is when we get some distance from Earth, and we don't have ready access to mission control, how can we align the cognitive age or virtual assistance that would take the place of some of the informational needs that crew currently reach down to mission control to obtain? So, what are those processes that we could leverage? And so, it gives us a decision support, an execution support, in terms of processes that we would have onboard, so that if there's something -- like Scott Kelly often had to address or repair of the (Carbon Dioxide Removal Assembly) CDRA system, the CO2 system. Would there be a capability in like a virtual reality or an enhanced reality system, to help guide a crew member to repair something, if they couldn't get real time comms with mission control on Earth? So, it's not to say that mission control becomes irrelevant. They'll always remain relevant, but what happens if you lose comms, and you need some kind of an assist? And we want to plan ahead. So, we have seven different researchers, and that's led by a former astronaut, Steve Robinson, out at the University of California, and he's done a masterful job of helping us integrate the other six, that are looking at various capabilities that can be brought to bear. We have another researcher at the University of Pennsylvania that just is completing a behavioral core measure. So, looking at the integration of multiple measures that will assess the cognitive changes that may be brought about, the changes to the team dynamics that may be revealed, and how do we learn from both ground analogs, then taking it, and he took this from the ground analogs onto space station, and we're just getting some of those data coming in now. We just completed the last, and part of what we asked him to do, as an add-on to his research, was a Mars capability assessment. So, one of the questions that is important for us to be able to answer is, once the crew land on Mars, what will their capability be, in terms of kind of fine motor cognitive processes, to connect a power grid to their landing craft. So, can they do that? If they can do that, then that would require less kind of mass weight and volume on the landing craft. If they can't do that, then we need to design more capability within the landing craft, perhaps more battery, to give them recovery time. So, can we cognitively, physically integrate our ability to carry out some task immediately upon landing, so we're able to look at crew after they've been in space and see, can they carry this task out? And those are the kinds of research questions that will immediately help us start to answer some of these really important questions.  Host: Yeah, there's a lot in there. There was -- when you were talking about doing an investigation, putting together a scenario, and I like the idea of bringing together multiple PIs, Principal Investigators, to ask different questions about the same scenario. Maybe get the fullest experience out of whatever you -- science that you want to do and take that, and then you mentioned doing things on the ground, doing things in analogs, and these almost simulations that are kind of like spaceflight. And then, bringing it to real spaceflight, and see how it works. This is all going to be very important coming up. We still have a lot that we can do on the Moon with Artemis, sure. But then, it sounds like one of the biggest things when it comes to performance is that level of autonomy, being able to not rely on the ground. And we hear it all the time, when it comes to operations. They're fixing something, like you mentioned, they're fixing something that's broken. They're working through the procedures. They encounter a snag, and what do they do? They call to the ground, and they say, \"Hey, I need help with this,\" and then they get assistance. So, not having that sort of, that sort of crutch to lean on, I could see how that could be really important. Aaron, you being an engineer, thinking about some of the design of some of these machines. It sounds like reliability is a big one, when it comes to some of the levels that would help with the autonomy of human factors and designing machines to be the best that they can be, so that they're the easiest for the humans. How do you see the relationship with some of the things you're doing in your group, and human factors and behavioral performance, and working with the engineers, to come up with the solution that's best for not only the practicality of the design, but making sure that the human element is considered?  Aaron Allcorn: We mentioned counter-measures kind of for people. The other -- two other items I would think was kind of technology development and standards and requirements. So, we -- the results of our research findings will be used and be documented and the standards and requirements that will be used in spacecraft for design. So, that's one of our primary areas of influence on future spacecraft.  Host: Yeah, that design is going to be really important, and it's going to definitely inform what we can do. Is there anything we're looking at now, perhaps on the International Space Station, perhaps on the ground in example. Tom, you've gone through a bunch of them so far. But an example of a human factors line of work. You mentioned screens, for example. That really incorporates the human that we're looking forward to in the near future.  Tom Williams: One of the tasks that we currently have is a research component, but it's also an operational component. And that's really the best type of assessment tool that we can use, is one that the crew would already be using in an operational way. And so, that's a robotic system, and that's when the crew takes delivery of a resupply vehicle, they have to use the Canadarm, and the device that they use is a robotic system, and we have a robotic trainer that's on board, that they practice with prior to actually taking receipt and connecting, using the Canadarm to connect and retrieve a resupply vehicle. So, we have them do that robotic task, which really is a visual, spatial, integration process. We have them do it pre-flight, early flight, mid-flight, late flight, and immediately post-landing. And so, that gives us a capability to look at how might operational performance change over the course of a mission. And then, if we can look at if someone's up there for six months versus nine months versus a year, how do we see that ability change with time? And that gives us a dose effect relationship between the effects of some of the spaceflight hazards and the performance changes that may accumulate over time. And so, the robotic task again is, it's an operational task, but we also have it as a research task, and that capability gives us an immediate crosswalk between what is the crew expected to do, and what are we assessing to determine how that capability may change over time.  Host: You mentioned crew. Obviously, a big part of doing human research is getting humans involved. So, naturally, on the space station, we can involve astronauts, and there's a certain level of expectation when it comes to astronauts. You mentioned ground studies though, too. So, who are we involving on the ground that would give us a good dataset for understanding what we can implement in space?  Tom Williams: So, one of the teams we work closely with is the Russian IBMP, and we just finished a four-month analog and had six crew members inside this analog, and it's inside Moscow, and it's configured like a spacecraft. And so, they were in an isolation facility for those four months and carrying out mission-relevant tasks. The lead member of that six-member team was a Russian cosmonaut that's actually flown in the past. So, and then the other individuals were all selected based on their backgrounds related to being crew-like. So, between 30 and 55 and a STEM background, as related earlier. So, that gives us an increase capability and confidence in our data when we know that we have individuals, one of whom is actually a cosmonaut, has flown, and we see their results and how it compares to others within the analog. And so, those -- that's one important partnership we have, and we're gearing up, about a year from now, to initiate an eight-month analog in that same facility, and then about 18 months later, a 12-month analog. So, that way we'll be able to look at the effects of this isolation and confinement at four months, eight months, and 12 months, and then assess how did we see changes, if any, accruing over those periods, relative to the isolation and confinement.? And then, how do we identify the stressors, and then how do we identify potential counter-measures that would mitigate that stress that we may see?  Host: There's a lot of different examples I'm hearing of the way teams are working together, and we're gathering these nice sets of data that we can put forward towards some of our future missions. What does that implementation process look like? Once we actually have the data, and we have all these, you know, you write papers. You publish something. You come up with a solution. What is the implementation of that in the culture of an astronaut performing tasks, in the culture of mission control, making sure that they give astronauts, or they know that the astronauts are going to have a certain level of autonomy. What's that implementation look like in the future?  Tom Williams: Well, part of the opportunities that these analogs present us is sort of revealed by some of the research that we've used Noshir Contractor from Northwestern University. So, Noshir has really done some great research for us that's looked at what are the characteristics of the team that you might put together, and what are those characteristics reveal, in terms of predicting who may get along and who may not get along, who may experience the most stress, in terms of the team interactions. So, he's been very effective in predicting what has happened, and we're going to be looking closely at how do we predict what will happen? So, looking at those characteristics, retrospectively, we've been able to say, yeah, we -- had we known these things, we would have seen that the likelihood of conflict was higher, given these combinations of characteristics of these team members and the demands that were placed on them. So, how can we prospectively do that, and that won't be so that we can limit who goes. It will be to help identify when might we need to provide a counter-measure, to reduce the risk of team conflict before it occurs. So, it will be ideal to look at any relationship and be able to predict what are the characteristics that lead to conflict. And some of that comes from some of the literature on even marital relationships, in terms of how does a marital couple interact, and you start to find that you can predict where there may be difficulties ahead, looking at how the relationship is unfolding, how many times they're criticizing each other, how many times they're making negative comments. So, how can we look at team processes in a similar way and predict where the problems may occur and then, try to prevent them from manifesting into a mission-threatening conflict or where crew would start to lose morale. So, these are all multiple areas that we try to bring together. So, no one solution will be the answer, but multiple ways of looking at what's the best team to put together? If we have to put together a team that may not work well together, how do we mitigate the risk of that manifesting into a mission-threatening conflict?  Host: I have a feeling that working for a team or with a team that's looking at how a team can work best together, might be one of the better teams to work for. That's not bad. Do you find, Aaron, when it comes to like how the organization is structured and working with all these professionals that are looking at how best to work well with one another. That's not bad, from a management perspective.  Aaron Allcorn: We are blessed with a great team, and it is -- it's a lot of fun to come to work, and it's a lot of fun to work with these individuals we got. We got a lot of work on our plate, so we're always very busy, but it's always pleasant, the folks we work with, yeah.  Host: Tell me more about the organizational structure of the element itself, the way -- I mean, we talked about a bunch of different areas that really cover the human factors and behavioral performance. So, what's the way your organization is structured, and where do those lines flow and what's important to you in how you set up things?  Aaron Allcorn: Yeah, we talked about kind of the -- kind of the partnership of management side, as well as the science side. And so, we do that not only at the element level, but our element's split into four different portfolios, and we do the same thing there, where we have a portfolio manager that really tracks budgets, schedule -- works those types of issues with the -- with the principal investigators, and then allows the -- and we have a discipline scientist also in that particular area, so they focus on the more technical, scientific things. So, that's -- we're structured that way at the portfolio level, as well.  Host: So, yeah, making sure -- because the organization has funds to conduct the science, and it sounds like it's not all entirely in house. We're working with analogs around the world, different places where we can go and test some of these ideas of team dynamics. But when it comes to actually working international, internationally and with other universities, what's that like, from the ground level? Just making sure that -- I mean, it's all here at Johnson Space Center, sure, but then it sounds like it's much wider than that. What's it like working with a global team?  Aaron Allcorn: Yeah, the management is at Johnson Space Center. Well, and part of our management is at Ames Research Center, as well.  Host: I see.  Aaron Allcorn: And so, we partner with other, and we have partners as well at Glenn Research Center that contribute to our -- contribute to our research. But a lot of the research is done by universities, so we will have a solicitation for some of these research gaps that are remaining, and different university professors or researchers will respond and provide a proposal on how they would help us buy down this risk in this particular area, and those will be reviewed at the science -- by the science team and selected. And so, we have researchers that will be selected from around the country that are participating in contributing to our risk reduction.  Host: So, Tom, you've mentioned risk reduction, in the sense of counter-measures. You know, you're identifying, you're looking at how these teams can work best together, and you even talked about at what point would you implement a counter-measure? What's an example of a counter-measure in this situation, particularly in a behavioral performance -- that one sounded pretty interesting -- but human factors, as well?  Tom Williams: So, one example would be what we do assessments of cognitive capabilities. So, we've had one team of researchers from the University of Pennsylvania, David Dinges and his team, and Matthias Basner, develop for us a cognition battery. So, some of the existing ways that we would assess cognitive ability, much like if you went and got a neuropsychological assessment, the problem with most existing measures was that astronauts are high-performing, and they were topping out. So, they were scoring so high, we never knew how much higher they might have gone had we had a test that was normed to astronauts. So, what we've worked on is developing a cognitive measure that is normed for astronauts, and that alerts us then to potential changes, and each one of the tests -- we have ten different tests on this cognition battery, and each one of the tests is mapped into an area of the brain. And the way that a cognitive battery is used on station if there, God forbid, was an accident, and you needed to -- a flight surgeon needed to assess what impact has this had on the crew member, then you could do a cognitive assessment and determine which part of the brain might have been most impacted by whatever injury occurred. And then, you could implement some kind of -- either medication or some kind of rehabilitation necessary to bring that up. Or you could assess maybe CO2 levels are too high, and that's starting to impact on their cognitive processing, and then a counter-measure would be, of course, to bring the CO2 levels back down. So, looking for what is changing, and then what do we think is accounting for the change, and the counter-measure mitigates the risk. So, a counter-measure can be -- it could be a technology, like we talked about with the human capability for autonomous systems. So, maybe a cognitive aid is then introduced to help the crew member for -- perform the task, based on the assessment or the need. It could be a clinical guideline that says, given this level, we now need to implement something. It could be close to what we described on, with Noshir Contractor on the team processes. We start to see increased team conflict mentioning, so we introduce some team building exercises with the flight surgeon. So, what we do is we look at guidelines, technology, capabilities, maybe an onboard system where it's like an avatar or some -- like an online therapist of sorts that the individual could interact with, to then mitigate some of the impact of the spaceflight.  Host: Would these people be integrated into normal operations? I mean, it might be a little bit different when you get to -- when you get farther out, and you have that communication delay. But aside from the research component of thinking about this ahead of time, what may they need? Do you have someone like that, sitting in mission control?  Tom Williams: Part of the -- there are flight surgeons and behavioral health and performance specialists, operational psychologists who interact with the crew on a periodic basis, and a lot of what we develop, we listen to what their needs are, and then develop techniques for the ability to meet that need. So, for example, the cognition battery gives them an enhanced capability to assess across multiple areas of performance versus the onboard system that we have today. So, and they're assessing how to bring that capability on board, what the impact may be? So, that's where we'll look at what do we currently have, in terms of the processes with the behavioral health and performance operational psychologists, and how do we support them by bringing a technology, a guideline, a capability that they've identified they need, or the research has informed us would help them.  Host: There you go. So, it's working with the crew, yes, so that they're informed, but then also with mission control, so that they understand these behavioral performance ideas, and if there were a situation like you described, that they have that information, that process, ready in hand.  Tom Williams: Yes.  Host: Now, this is -- you know, I don't believe that this element is siloed. Right? it's not just human factors and behavioral performance, and we stick to our lane, and we press forward. How are you working with some of the other elements across HRP?  Tom Williams: OK. Yeah. One of the great integrated aspects of what we're working on now is, it's called the CBS. It's short for the CNS changes that we expect may occur as a result of space radiation exposure.  Host: CNS is cognitive?  Tom Williams: I'm sorry. The central nervous system.  Host: The central nervous system.  Tom Williams: Right.  Host: OK.  Tom WIlliams: And the behavioral medicine effects that we may see, so that the cognitive changes that may accrue due to isolation and confinement and the sensory motor effects that may come about because of altered gravity. So, those are three different elements -- the space radiation element, our human factors and behavioral performance for the b med risk, and the health and human counter-measures for the sensory motor risk. And as you think about the hazards that we've talked about in previous podcasts, we have a human in the center of all those hazards, and so it would be really important for us to understand how might these three hazards come together, because all three are interacting in some way on your cognitive or behavioral performance capabilities. So, if you have a change in your central nervous system, or you have a change in your neurovestibular system, how might that manifest into some behavioral change that would be important? And what's really interesting is when you think about how this would relate to some of the requirements that we have on Earth. We have neurovestibular changes that occur as we age. We have cognitive changes that may occur as we age, as well. When those two things are going together, how might we be able to predict in what way we can help people on Earth by looking at how these processes are being impacted in spaceflight and what type of counter-measure or what type of quick rehabilitation can we use, and might these help in some way? Just as an example, we're working with one Harvard neurologist who's identified pathways where they're stimulating a pathway on a post-stroke patient to try to accelerate the recovery of some of the capabilities post-stroke. So part of our CBS integrated approach is to look at brain performance pathways. So, we're leveraging a lot of the data from the investment that NASA and the Human Research Program has made, putting that together into a computational model, to then predict, based on these different exposures of radiation, altered gravity exposure, or stress, how do those come together, get manifested into some kind of behavioral performance change that we can map into which part of the brain, to then predict and preempt some kind of decrement in performance, and how do we establish where those levels of performance that are acceptable are?  Host: That is interesting. It's the process of coming up with how to analyze these changes, that you take that process, and you implement it into something that is very, very much real here on Earth. But you said post-stroke victims?  Tom Williams: Yes.  Host: That is incredible, is the process of coming up with the research. Do you find that integration pretty common, Aaron, when it comes to doing this research for spaceflight? You already mentioned an example yourself, and then bringing it back here to Earth. You know, do you find that happens pretty frequently?  Aaron Allcorn: Yes, and I think the -- it's probably more and more, as we're -- as the research is converging, and we're -- all the different elements of looking at counter-measures, we want to make sure our counter-measures are in agreement with one another, I guess? You know, I'm thinking of exercise, or I'm thinking of a medication that might be prescribed, and what might be good for one thing might hurt another thing. So, it will be -- as our research comes together, and other elements research comes together, it would be important to optimize those, I think.  Host: This is where communication comes really into effect, because you want to -- if you're going to implement a counter-measure, you don't -- want to make sure it's actually going to cause another problem that's going to need another counter-measure. This was something that actually Jenn Fogarty mentioned in part one in this series when it comes to counter-measures. Tell me about working more with other elements and other researchers to make sure that if you do come up with an idea, of the counter-measure, like you described, Tom, that it's not going to have more negative effects downstream.  Tom Williams: Yeah, it's a great question, because one of the things we've looked at in some of the CBS research is looking at animal models, and of course, we use animal models in exposing them to different levels of radiation, and one of our researchers, who's Susannah Rossi at the University of San Francisco, has identified that there's a substance, and it's in human clinical trials now -- PLX5622 is the precise name -- and using that in animals will neutralize some of the effects of radiation exposure on the brain. So, in that central nervous system, the effects that we get concerned about, when you expose the animals to this substance, it wipes out that effect, but at a cost to the immune system. The microglia are the actual impact that's impacted -- the microglia are impacted, and that's what we're most concerned about. But what happens then is the immune system becomes more vulnerable to an opportunistic infection. And so, then that activates -- we've taken care of one risk potentially, the effects of the space radiation on the central nervous system, but now we've increased the potential risk of another. And that's the opportunistic infection that we already know you'll hear from some of our health and human counter-measures team about the importance of that immune process. So, we have to be very careful, just as Aaron was noting, about introducing one counter-measure, and inadvertently causing an increased risk in another capability that we hadn't determined ahead of time. And that's why it's so important to now take a look at these integrated counter-measures and the integrated approaches, so that we don't have what sometimes is referred to as a black swan, something we should have realized in retrospect was likely to occur that had some big outcome, and that's what we're really striving to avoid.  Host: So, it seems like one of the more different things when it comes to this type of research is you do all this research, and you're trying to answer these questions, and when you do come up with a counter-measure, that may not exactly solve, or it may cause something else downstream. So, it seems like you do have to have that integration, to make sure you're incorporating all of these different minds, all of these different disciplines, so that you're not -- you have the right solution. The first thing that comes to mind is -- I mean, I worked in large teams before. Not super easy. Everyone has their own idea about what solution to implement. So, when it comes to working with large teams, and coming up with an idea of this is the best course of action for spaceflight, I'm sure, you know, it's a hard thing. It's difficult for everyone to come together and agree on something like that.  Aaron Allcorn: Sure, there's a lot of healthy discussion, I think. And that's probably -- a lot of that around here, but we have one goal. We have the same mission and the end goal in mind. So, I think everybody kind of keys in on that, and we're trying to do what is best to protect our crew member overall. And so.  Host: Yeah. So, how have you seen, Tom, when it comes to conducting this type of research, the human factors and behavioral performance, how have you seen that progress through the years, and what we've done in the past, and how that's evolved into how we think about how to conduct this type of research?  Tom Williams: I really believe that a lot of the lines of our human factor research is we've invested in a great opportunity, and a lot of that science is maturing for us now, and it's coming to make the contribution that was anticipated when it was first funded. So, a number of our studies, as they're now delivering the results, are helping us to now look at a more integrated approach on a human system integration architecture. So, how do the five human factors areas -- the training that we talked about, the mission processes and tasks, the habitat, which we haven't really talked about that much -- but how do we ensure that there's a smart habitat that's responsive to the crew's needs and helps sustain them? And some of the human automated robotic integration and human-computer integration, those are now coming together nicely for us, in a human system integration architecture. So, we -- just as you were describing, we shouldn't keep trying to keep siloes, because the crew will experience these in an integrated fashion. How do we ensure our science delivers the capability in the way the crew will need to experience that? And that's one of the areas that we see maturing. The investments that have been made by the Human Research Program is now maturing in many of these lanes, to bring us to a capability that we say, OK, this is an acceptable level of risk.  Host: There it is, yes, that -- it's that integration. Like you said, the crews are going to experience -- I like that. The crews going to experience not in these different siloes of research. They just are going to experience their environment, as it is, and you have to make sure that all of these different elements are combined together. Aaron, when you're thinking about -- we're coming up on 20 years of continuous human habitation on the space station. It's a long time, and it's not the only time that people have been in space. We're talking about decades, even before that. What excites you the most about what -- how things have progressed with that continuous duration? That's a lot of research. That's a lot of data that we can get, from learning how humans can live and work in space. What excites you the most?  Aaron Allcorn: Yeah. Well, I love the impacts that we have back here on Earth, for one. And for another, I -- you know, we're not just wanting to stay on low Earth orbit. We want to send people to explore out even further. And so, taking those next steps, and what can we learn from our astronauts who have been in low Earth orbit, that kind of we can take with us, to -- for longer duration missions.  Host: Yeah. I mean, low Earth orbit. That's where we've been, really, mainly. And when it comes to -- if you're thinking back to the Apollo era, when we were last on the Moon, that was a long time ago, and they were there for very short durations. A lot of guests I had referred to them as camping trips. That's how short they were. But coming up in the near future, there's a lot of opportunity for longer duration, for more human research focus, when it comes to people on the Moon. So, Tom, what excites you more about, you know, what questions do we still have that maybe the Moon can help us answer?  Tom Williams: That's a great question, because a lot of what the Artemis mission will offer us is the ability to kind of look at some of those habitats, potentially. A crew in this 1/6th environment, if they sleep on the Moon, will their circadian and sleep patterns be different in a microgravity versus a 1/6th gravity? Again, the habitats that we would construct, and there's a visual perception change that occurs on the Moon, because of the lack of an atmosphere, how might that change perceptual processing, and how does that alter over time? Do you adapt to that? Do you not adapt to it? So, those are some important questions that would help us get answered on the Moon. And just the effects of an increased exposure to radiation, because there will be a slight increase to the radiation exposure that you'll encounter on the Moon, as compared to even on station today.  Host: Now, normally, I think that would be an awesome place to end, but you did mention habitats, when it comes to the Moon. And I know we're doing research on the ground, in several of the analogs actually that Aaron actually mentioned. So, what are we -- what kinds of research are we doing there that may help us, when it comes to the Moon?  Tom WIlliams: That's a great question, again. So, one of the things that came up about 18 months ago was the need for private crew quarters on long duration missions. And there was a lot of opinions about what was needed, but no science to back it up. So, one of the things that we had the capability to do is, we leveled science requirements on the research operations and integration team to reconfigure the HERA habitat, and to remove the private crew quarters, so that we could start assessing the impact in an analog, of four crew members who no longer have private sleeping areas, and we reduced some of the volume, to bring it closer to what they'll experience, in terms of habitat, net habitable volume, that they'll have on the gateway. So, those two major changes help us, on the ground, put humans in a similar confined environment, and we brought in several stowage bags that looked very much like you would experience on station, reducing the privacy of the crew quarters. And now, we're starting to get the research accumulated, to determine, does it really matter. And then, that will help ensure that, as we move forward, whether there's a demonstrated need for the private crew quarters, or not, or a private area. So, it will help us bring science. That doesn't mean that's the final decision, but that means a decision maker will have the informed ability to determine a mass weight volume trade-off on private crew quarters versus none.  Host: That is significant, because naturally, if everyone gets their own room, that's more space. That's more things you've got to build. You've got to build enough rooms for everyone. So, I'm sure, you know, that's design challenges that engineers are going to have to deal with, if it comes down to maybe everyone needs their own room. But knowing that ahead of time is super important.  Tom Williams: Exactly.  Host: Plus the Moon will be a great place to test some stuff out too, right?  Tom Williams: Right.  Host: Because after that, the next thing is Mars. It gets a whole lot harder there but understanding that and getting that data on the Moon will be very vital. Aaron and Tom, thank you so much for coming on, and talking about human factors and behavioral performance. This was enlightening. I absolutely enjoyed it, and it was a pleasure to have you both.

                        "description": "Pat Ryan (Host): Houston, we have a podcast. Welcome to the official podcast of the NASA Johnson Space Center, Episode 125, \"Deep Space Healthcare.\" I'm Pat Ryan. On this podcast, we talk with scientists, engineers, astronauts, and other folks about their part in America's Space Exploration Program, and today, that includes doctors. Because this is the next part in our series about how NASA is preparing to safely send human beings on future missions to space, from missions to the International Space Station, to the Moon, and eventually to Mars. NASA's Human Research Program is working to learn how the human body is affected by being in the spaceflight environment, so we can figure out how to keep the bad things from happening and be prepared to fight back against those effects if and when they do happen. The HRP has divided that work up into five elements, and we're learning about them in our current series of podcasts that started with Episode 123, \"Humans in Space.\" Today, we focus on developing the plans to take care of those future astronauts. As HRP says on its own website, \"Identifying and testing next-generation medical care and crew health maintenance technologies.\" We have two guests. Nancy Fleming is Element Manager for Exploration Medical Capability, which you'll hear us refer to as ExMC. She began her career at NASA as an avionics and systems instructor for International Space Station and space shuttle astronauts, and for flight control team members, and she's worked in program management, and in mission operations. And Dr. Kris Lehnhardt is the ExMC Element Scientist. Lehnhardt is board certified in emergency medicine in the United States and Canada. You'll find out why. He also works in clinical shifts in the emergency department at Houston's Ben Taub Hospital. That's a top trauma center in our city. He has appointments as a senior faculty with the Baylor College of Medicine in the Center for Space Medicine, and in their Department of Emergency Medicine. So, here's part three of six on NASA's Human Research Program, Exploration Medical Capability. Here we go.  [ Music ]  Host: If you ask any astronaut, or engineer, or scientist, or flight controller around NASA, they will all agree that spaceflight is hard. And you add humans to the mix, and it makes it even harder. For example, we put any numbers of robots on Mars. They've got scientific instruments, and cameras, transmitting devices, so we here on Earth can see what they're doing. But so far, zero people. When you add people to the equation, it becomes very much more complicated, because protecting people from the environment outside the protection of Earth's atmosphere is really hard. It's much harder than fortifying robots for work in outer space. Well, NASA has been working on this human problem since the very beginning of human spaceflight. The Human Research Program coordinates a wide range of studies, and experiments, and projects. They group it into five elements, including one called Exploration Medical Capability. And if you've been listening to the podcast, you're hearing about all of the others in great detail, too. But for today, Nancy Fleming, the element manager for Exploration Medical Capability -- I'll start by asking you, so that we're properly focused here. What is the work of your element, ExMC?  Nancy Fleming: Thanks. I'm happy to be here, and happy to tell you about the work of ExMC. I'm here with our element scientist, Dr. Kris Lehnhardt, and the work of our element -- we work hand-in-hand together to solve the problems associated with long-duration spaceflight to Mars, and how we will address if an astronaut gets injured or sick during that time frame, and the best way to address that.  Host: What is an element manager at this element do?  Nancy Fleming: As an element manager-- I'm part of the leadership team. I work in concert with Dr. Lehnhardt, and together, we set the technical direction of the work of the element. And as a manager, I manage the resources. I make sure that we get the people that we need to do the work, the scientists, the engineers, the physicians, the clinicians in order to accomplish that work. I manage the budgets. We do a lot of communication together. We, together, steer the ship of the work, and ensure that the taxpayers are getting the best bang for their buck.  Host: What was your career that led you to this? Because I think you've been at NASA for some time in other kinds of jobs, right?   Nancy Fleming: I have. My career to NASA is kind of circuitous. It's not kind of circuitous. It's really circuitous, and when I was young, my dad was an electronics technician. And I had this propensity for solving problems, and he recognized that in me. And when I was in sixth grade -- so I think that's -- you're about 12 in sixth grade. My dad sat me down one afternoon, because I was kind of a curious kid, too, and he taught me what hexadecimal was.  Host: Why were you being punished? [laughter]  Nancy Fleming: I thought -- I found it absolutely fascinating.  Host: Really? OK.  Nancy Fleming: What I was excited about was, I had no idea that math and numbers could be manipulated in a creative way that could then be used to solve complex problems. And thus, started my curiosity down that path, and wanting to learn more about math. And I think when I was about 14, I decided I wanted to be a mathematician when I grew up.  Host: Oh, nice.  Nancy Fleming: And as life takes different routes, it did for me, but eventually, I got back to college, and I became a mathematician. And that gave me -- what was exciting about that is, again, solving problems in a creative way, and using a variety of techniques -- mathematical techniques, and things that you don't really normally think of, because they're happening behind the scenes in machines. And that gave me a step -- a foot in the door to be introduced to the work that NASA is doing. So, I moved to Clear Lake, and as you know, Johnson Space Center is in Clear Lake, in Houston, Texas. And I had a professor who was solving problems here for NASA, and he said, \"Hey, do you want to solve some problems with me?\" I said, \"Absolutely. Let me go do that.\" And while I did that, I met folks at NASA, and then I was hired in. And my first job here at NASA, 20 years ago, was training the first International Space Station crews.  Host: Nice.  Nancy Fleming: So, the very first crews for the ISS -- I trained them on the computer systems, and the environmental control and life support systems, and the communication systems.  Host: Nice.  Nancy Fleming: 20 years later, I am now a manager that works with an amazing team of very talented and gifted scientists, physicians, engineers that are working to solve problems in creative ways.  Host: I remember doing an interview with Bill Shepherd, who was the Expedition One Commander, who was fascinated by the fact that, unlike other spaceships or ships that he'd been on before, the International Space Station all was on computers. He was -- told me, \"There isn't a light switch to turn things on and off. It's all on the computers.\" And you --  Nancy Fleming: I trained him on those computers.  Host: -- were teaching on the computers.  Nancy Fleming: Absolutely.  Host: Nice.  Nancy Fleming: We -- I spent a lot of quality time with Shep.  Host: Kris Lehnhardt, what does an element scientist do for ExMC?  Kris Lehnhardt: The job of the element scientist is, as Nancy said, to be part of a team, a leadership team that -- I try to describe to people -- we're sort of the conductors of the orchestra, if you will. So, if the orchestra are all of our clinicians, and physicians, and scientists, and engineers who are helping to design medical systems to go to Mars, we provide them with guidance and direction for what they're going to do. And a lot of our work -- a lot of my work is focused on really trying to dig deep into the problem of providing medical care for space exploration and developing concepts or solutions for that problem. And then our team goes off and actually develops and builds those solutions.  Host: As Nancy mentioned, you're a doctor, but give me the thumbnail of your background.  Kris Lehnhardt: So, mine is equally circuitous to Nancy's.  Host: You guys that competitive, that you're arguing about [laughter] who took the longest route to get here?  Nancy Fleming: We are not competitive. You will find that we are very much a team. We are very much a -- and we have other people that are part of our team as well, our leadership team.  Host: You're -- go ahead, Kris.  Kris Lehnhardt: So, if my accent hasn't given me away yet, I'm originally from Canada, and I grew up as a space nerd. But I also had an intense love of biology. It was in high school that someone encouraged me to think about going into medicine, and I saw that there were astronauts who had been physicians previously. And in fact, there was a Canadian astronaut who was an emergency physician.  Host: Dave Williams.  Kris Lehnhardt: Dave Williams, exactly right. And so, I said, \"Well, maybe I'll go be an emergency physician, and then I can be involved in space.\" And so, that was my initial path, and what I learned as I was doing that was that there was this entire field in medicine called aerospace medicine that I knew nothing about. But what it was, essentially, was the study of medicine in extreme environments, and there's no more extreme environment than space. But there's a lot to learn from all these other environments, as well. So, I studied about wilderness medicine, and diving medicine, and flight medicine, and space medicine, and all of that was focused on how do you provide medical care to people in these terribly difficult places where they don't have any of the stuff that they would otherwise want to have with them? And that path is what brought me to NASA.  Host: You went to some of those extreme environments on your own, didn't you?  Kris Lehnhardt: I do enjoy taking some smart risks, if you will. So, I learned to fly planes. I'm a reservist in the military in Canada, in the Royal Canadian Air Force, as a medical specialist, and I learned to be a scuba diver as well. And so, what I realized as I was training and learning about how to provide medical care in these environments is that I had to actually understand the environments. And these environments, like spaceflight, are what we refer to as operational environments. And so, if you don't understand the challenges of being in those places, it's very hard to think about the problems of providing care in those. As a doctor, most doctors think about hospitals, and large teams of people, and lots of equipment.  Host: Right.  Kris Lehnhardt: And these environments preclude all of that.  Host: There's something you said there a moment ago that struck me. You're talking about how to provide care to people who are in these environments, but not necessarily because that environment impacted them, but it sounds like because they're in a hard place for you, the physician, to get to.  Kris Lehnhardt: Yes, to both. The environment itself, frankly, is trying to kill you, so that is part of the problem. Another part of the problem is that even the healthiest and most fit people in these extreme environments -- we're all still human, and the human system inevitably breaks down. Like your car, various components break down over time. So, treating the human system in that environment is challenging, but changing the mindset of the physician or the clinician who's providing care to people in these environments is essential as well. Because if they are reliant upon their equipment, and their facilities, and their ability to consult with other people, once you take all of that away, can they still do their job?  Host: What can they do? In getting ready to talk with you today, what seemed to filter out to me, as I was thinking about it, was that what you're trying to develop now for future spaceflight is the hospital, or the clinic, or the sick bay capability for taking care of crews on future missions who are farther away, much farther away even than they are on the International Space Station right now. Is that a good analogy, or a valid one?  Nancy Fleming: The sick bay is a great analogy. As you know if you're a Star Trek fan, there's a sick bay in Star Trek, and as you also know if you're a space fan at all, you know that spacecraft are incredibly small. And so, the problem to solve about creating a sick bay for a spacecraft is just how do you get all the things that you need in that to be small and efficient, and we are working towards that.  Host: Yeah, you don't have -- you don't have a warehouse.  Nancy Fleming: We don't have a warehouse, no, and things need to be integrated, and they need to be multi-functional -- that they have the ability to be used for the highest probability of illness or injury that we're anticipating.  Host: And I wanted to -- to touch on this later, but I think what we're -- we want to realize -- and I learned this only just recently -- is that as you're trying to put this all together, you don't have unlimited resources. And you can't supply everything that might possibly be needed, because that spaceship is small, and there's no room for it.  Nancy Fleming: That is very correct.  Host: And the fact is, in the cases of going to the Moon, or going to Mars, they're going so far away that you can't even send it to them.  Nancy Fleming: That is true. You can't send things, and you can't -- you have no resupply, which is sending supplies up. And you can't send things back for analysis, or care.  Host: At least not in a timely fashion.  Nancy Fleming: Right, not in a timely fashion. So, the way that we work for -- with the ISS right now, and even for the Moon, because they are so much closer to the Earth than heading to Mars and Mars is, we have those luxuries of return and supply, and constant communication. And as you get further from the Earth, when you're headed out towards Mars, you lose those luxuries.  Host: As you're working with some of those concepts in mind, you're also working with the other people in the Human Research Program who are working on other focused areas. Give me a sense of how your element works in coordination with the others to tackle this whole big problem of taking care of human bodies outside this safety umbrella.  Kris Lehnhardt: We have to work really closely with the other elements of the Human Research Program, because as you just said, our resources that we're going to have for these missions are extremely limited. And what we're going to have to do is, we're going to have to make tough decisions about what we can actually take with us. And so, as a result, if we each -- if each group does their own individual research, and comes up with their own solution, but we don't look at how that -- all those different solutions combine together into an integrated system, then we're going to end up with a bunch of disparate stuff. And the ultimate goal of the Human Research Program is to help NASA to provide a crew that is both physically and mentally fit to accomplish the mission. And the way that we do that is by developing a crew health and performance system for Mars that integrates all of the work of HRP, to make sure that we can keep them safe and healthy while we do the mission.  Host: It has struck me in talking and hearing you -- some of your colleagues talk, too, that overall, HRP is looking at finding ways to keep people well and safe in this environment, and your element is looking at how to take care of them when they get sick or injured anyway.  Nancy Fleming: That is true. We always like to tell folks, \"We're the tail end of the dog.\" We'd like -- prevention is the best cure, but we're also realists. And we know that people aren't healthy 100 percent of the time, regardless of how well you take care of yourself. Even here on Earth, you may be the epitome of taking care of yourself in all of the right ways, but eventually, your body is a machine, and it's going to break down at some point. And we know that that will be the case in space, and so, we must plan for those contingencies.  Host: Let me get you to help educate us a bit about space medicine, or -- and taking care of people in space. I have heard -- and in the past year, while we've been hearing about anniversaries of Apollo missions, there have been references to things that are even older than that. And back in -- before Mercury flew, it's like doctors were concerned that if they sent people to space, they weren't going to even be able to swallow, because of -- because of the lack of gravity or such. Give me a sense of how space medicine has evolved from those days, through Mercury up to where we are right now, and the ways that we are now able to care for people that we send to space.  Kris Lehnhardt: The space medicine, in the beginning, as you described, was really about how does the human body even work in space? And if it does work in space, can we try and anticipate what types of events are going to occur, and then treat them? And so, from the beginning of space medicine, that's what people have been studying. When we started out with Mercury, they had a very small kit of stuff that they took with them. In fact, I think it fit in a pouch, or a pocket on their leg, and it was like the kind of thing you would take if you were going hiking for a day. And it was really about managing immediate problems, and taking these very healthy people, and giving them some very simple solutions for if they had any ailments that would impact the mission.  Host: And on a very short mission. They weren't expected to be gone for very long.  Kris Lehnhardt: Yes, absolutely. The short mission duration for all of Mercury, Gemini, and Apollo meant that the medical kit was relatively small and didn't have a lot of capability. As we evolved from there to the space shuttle, and then to the ISS, we started developing more robust capabilities for taking care of people. So, for example, on ISS, right now, there's an ultrasound machine that allows us to diagnose medical problems in spaceflight. That ultrasound machine in the future -- our vision of medical care when we go to Mars, and the transition from current-day ISS operations to the future, is this integrated system, where we have all of these amazing capabilities -- laboratory analysis for blood and urine, imaging analysis for ultrasound, all of the medications we're going to need, all of the equipment we're going to need. We're going to have that all as an integrated system, and we're going to try and move past the days of the medical kit, the kind of thing that you take when you go hiking, or you go on a camping trip, to something that's going to be taking care of people for years at a time.  Host: The Swiss Army knife of medical care?  Kris Lehnhardt: That'd be a nice -- it'd be nice to have one of those. I'm sure that we would find some uses for that, but it would be very important for us to know how that piece of equipment worked with all of the other equipment as well.  Host: As we said, in early days of human spaceflight, people were not gone for very long, and they weren’t leaving their spacecraft. And the -- I think that, realistically, the chances that they become injured were probably pretty small, but doctors were concerned that they didn't know how the people were going to be able to even function in that environment, right?  Nancy Fleming: That's what 50 years have brought to us. The human body is -- in space has been studied over that time, and we've learned a lot. In fact, over just the last 20 years, with continuous presence in the ISS, you've had people in space for 20 years, and we've been collecting data on those bodies for 20 years. And we are using that data in ways to inform how we design the next system.  Host: You doctors, and engineers love you data, I know [laughter]. So, you've --  Nancy Fleming: Scientists, too. [Laughter]  Host: -- been -- you've been -- but you've been keeping track of all 200 and -- I think it's 39 right now -- different human beings who have been onboard the International Space Station in 19-plus years. I take it that's been useful? [Laughter]  Kris Lehnhardt: We are putting that data to very good use. That information is going to help us to try and predict the kind of medical events that are going to occur on the way to Mars, and it's through that prediction -- we do a risk analysis, and we essentially come up with lists of conditions, and the most likely conditions. And that helps us to scope a medical system. We would love to take a hospital emergency room on the way to Mars, but that is simply not feasible. And so, what we have to do is, we have to use the data to help us to make evidence-based decisions for what we are going to take to go to Mars. Because the worst-case scenario is that you take stuff that you don't end up using, because that means that that stuff took up space that could've been used for something else.  Host: Else that was needed.  Kris Lehnhardt: Exactly. And so, the -- at the end of the day, this is actually a -- believe it or not, this is an economics problem, which is called the backpack problem.  Host: OK.  Kris Lehnhardt: And it's based all upon maximizing benefit and minimizing risk, or cost. And so --  Host: Which sounds thoroughly reasonable, yeah.  Kris Lehnhardt: -- right. How can we get the best stuff that takes up the least amount of space, that gives you the most bang for your buck.  Host: On the -- studying the astronauts on the space station, you're familiar with the data, and I'm not. Can you give me some sense of things that you've learned after 19-plus years of people in space? What do we know now that we didn't know then?  Nancy Fleming: Well, something that we know now, but we kind of knew before then, was the human body is really just a bag of water with some bones in it. [laughter] And that becomes more apparent when you're in space. [laughter]  Host: Yeah. In -- whoops -- in the -- in what sense?  Nancy Fleming: And what that means is, is in space -- while on the ground, everything your body -- how your body works is used to the gravity pulling it down towards your feet, and so all of your fluid functions get pulled towards your feet. And your body knows how to counteract that with gravity. When you're in a zero-gravity environment, it all equalizes out, no different than when you're diving. You know how you equalize, or you get into a neutral position? That's what happens to your body in space. It becomes a sack of water, and all of those fluids just float. They don't -- they aren't pulled anywhere, and so, your systems have to work differently to push and pull them. You get more fluid in your head, and you're not used to that fluid in your head on the ground, because it all goes towards your feet. And so, that fluid in your head can have different effects on your vision, or depending on how that is, it could have an effect on the way that you're thinking about problem-solving.  Host: It effects your thought processes, too? Is that what you're saying?  Kris Lehnhardt: So, the spaceflight environment -- the lack of gravity, the radiation associated with it, the isolation and confinement on the space station -- all of that affects the performance of the people onboard and has the ability to affect their thinking as well. And so, when we talk about health, we often talk about medicine, but in this case, the health and performance of the crew is as equally -- is equally important.  Host: You take what you've learned from this data, studying these astronauts over this time -- have you had an opportunity -- or, not you personally, but NASA had the opportunity, then, to try to use these astronauts on the space station as -- to test out ways to counteract those things?  Kris Lehnhardt: The space station is the perfect environment that we have -- the best available environment that we have right now to study how humans are going to explore the rest of space.  Host: And I make -- I'm going to stop you there, but first, how do we compare the microgravity environment on the space station to the environment that crews on the way to Mars would experience? Are they very comparable, or very different from one another?  Kris Lehnhardt: They are more similar than they are different.  Host: OK.  Kris Lehnhardt: And so, the spaceflight environment --  Host: On the station -- even better for studying.  Kris Lehnhardt: -- on the station is a great analogue for studying what we need to learn to go to Mars, absolutely right. So, the microgravity that you experience on the space station is essentially identical to the micro-gravity that you're going to experience on the way to Mars. The -- we have no way of simulating that for an extended period of time on the ground. So, we need the space station in order to study microgravity deep space has a different radiation environment than the space station does.  Host: OK.  Kris Lehnhardt: So, there are some elements of deep space on the way to Mars where the radiation is going to be substantially different, but the ISS is still exposed to that same space radiation, just in different ways, and is still a better place to study that than we can do on the ground. We have the ability to create or mimic space radiation on the ground, but nothing beats the real thing.  Host: Mm-hmm. And so, using the space station, as we were saying, is a way to test ideas, or theories about how we are going to take care of those future astronauts. And some of those things have worked out. Tell me about some of those -- those ideas that have been tested.  Nancy Fleming: So, in Exploration Medical Capability, we do a lot of technology demonstrations on the space station. We do medical technology demonstrations. We want to try to find out if -- how fluids work in space, if we can put an IV in in space. We need to find out if we can do -- how we can analyze blood in space. We've done analysis on -- we have done technology demonstrations on imaging, different type of imaging equipment, and if they can be extended to be used for more different types of things. Do you want to tell them about IVGEN?  Kris Lehnhardt: Sure. So, we, a number of years ago, developed a system that would be able to take the water on the space station and generate fluids that can be used intravenously, in case an astronaut were sick or injured.  Host: Is that what the IB-GEN you mentioned is?  Nancy Fleming: IV, yes.  Kris Lehnhardt: IV Generation.  Host: Generation. OK, go --  Nancy Fleming: Like you have an IV in a hospital.  Host: -- yeah, got you. Go ahead, Kris. Continue.  Kris Lehnhardt: That type of system would allow future astronauts to develop and use IV fluid at the time that they need it. Right now, what we have to do is, we fly bags of IV fluid to the space station. Those bags all have expiry dates on them, so if we don't use them, that was mass and volume that could've been used in some other, better way.  Host: Yeah, that trade-off you referred to a few minutes ago.  Kris Lehnhardt: Exactly. So, an integrated system in the future has an environmental control and life support system that's already providing water to the astronauts to drink. We want to take that same water, transform it into IV fluids, and be able to use it in case someone gets sick or injured. That's the kind of system integration and technology development that we hope to continue to do on the space station, to prepare for Mars.  Host: Not to go too far off, but how do you transfer -- transform regular water into IV solutions? What do you -- do you have something you have to add to it?  Kris Lehnhardt: You sterilize the water, and then you add certain solutes to that water to make it -- essentially, you're adding salt to the water, and the technology that is developed there is one that has applications for spaceflight, but also has applications on the ground.   Host: And I guess similar to the way they do it on the ground, except that they -- as you can see, I'm pointing up to the station -- they don't have the benefit of gravity to help mix those components, right?  Kris Lehnhardt: Correct.  Host: The next step in testing -- he thinks -- is going to be when the Artemis program puts astronauts on the Moon, which is further away than the space station, but not nearly as far away as Mars is. Is that the next step in this process, that -- Nancy's shaking --  Nancy Fleming: Absolutely it is.  Host: -- eyes all lit up. Yes, we want that.  Nancy Fleming: It is. You know, the purpose of Artemis is not just the boots on the Moon, but it's also to have a Moon base, and explore more on that Moon -- on the Moon and see what you can get -- what the Moon can provide to us. If there is a Moon base, once that is there, that is -- that will become the best analogue. It will supersede ISS as an analogue for Mars, and it is a stepping stone to Mars. And the reason for that is you will be there long -- long duration, and as Kris mentioned earlier, the galactic cosmic radiation is more similar on the Moon to what you will experience going forward.  Host: On Mars, but not as similar to what they get on the space station.  Nancy Fleming: On ISS, because the ISS is still within the atmosphere, the protection.  Host: The Moon also has some gravity that the space station doesn't have.  Nancy Fleming: Absolutely, and --  Host: And Mars has gravity, although they're not the same as each other, right?  Nancy Fleming: -- correct.  Kris Lehnhardt: So, we refer to that, in most cases, as partial gravity. And so, if Earth is one G, and the space station is zero G, then the Moon is about 1/6th G, and Mars is about 1/3rd. And so, the partial gravity environment of the Moon is something that is very important for us to become more familiar with, and to study in depth. We know that the human body changes significantly on the space station because of the lack of gravity. What we don't know is whether or not -- what amount of gravity the human body needs in order to function in a way that's most similar to Earth, and it may be that the gravity on the Moon is actually sufficient for us to be able to function more like we do on the ground, on Earth, than we do on the space station. And so, being able to study people for long durations on the Moon is going to give us invaluable data.  Host: Longer than just the couple of days that they were there in the Apollo program.  Nancy Fleming: Sure, mm-hmm.  Host: What other things are you thinking that you can do at a -- at a sustainable Moon base that you need to do for the -- for future Mars missions?  Nancy Fleming: So, one of the key things that we've been studying is how medications change in space, in the zero-G environment, and in a radiation environment.  Host: You mean like become less potent over time, or --  Nancy Fleming: Yeah, maybe become less potent, and if they become toxic.  Host: -- oh.  Nancy Fleming: Yeah, so we're very concerned about that.  Host: Not good.  Nancy Fleming: [Laughter] Right. And so, we're actually working with the [Food and Drug Administration] FDA on -- to gather data associated with that, and then we fly medications to the space station, and bring them back, and studying them as well. We'd like to do that on the Moon because of the different environment, and because it is more analogous to heading to Mars for us, to find out which medications can be safe and effective for that longer-duration trip to Mars.  Host: I know that, because I did stories on it a long time ago -- that on the space station, they were touting what was called a telemedicine capability, the ability with two-way video for doctors on the ground, for flight surgeons here in Houston to talk to and to see the astronauts on the station back and forth, and to diagnose them. And that sort of thing is even used on the planet, for people in remote locations, too. Is that not something that you could employ for crews going to Mars?  Kris Lehnhardt: It is, but it's going to look different.  Host: Is, but.  Kris Lehnhardt: But. [laughter] They -- the communication challenges we're going to have going to Mars are significant. So, because we are stuck with the speed of light as it is, we can't get information back from Mars faster than ten minutes, which means that back-and-forth communications between here and Mars will take 20 minutes. And so, trying to have a conversation --  Host: Or more.  Kris Lehnhardt: -- or more. Trying to have a conversation with somebody where you're waiting 20 minutes for their response is a very boring conversation.  Host: And let's be really blunt about this to everybody. The reason for that is because Mars is so far away.  Kris Lehnhardt: Absolutely. If you consider the ISS, and the Moon, and Mars, the Moon is about 1000 times further away from Earth than the ISS, and Mars is about 1000 times further away from the Moon. So, the distances are immense that these communications have to transit, and one of the challenges that we're going to have, even beyond the delay in the communications for Mars, is that during a mission to Mars, there's going to be a period of time where the sun is in between Mars and the Earth. And the sun is going to prevent all communications from going back and forth. So, there's going to be a period of time where we are going to have people on the surface of Mars, probably about a week and a half to two weeks where we can't see or talk to them at all.  Host: At all, wow.  Kris Lehnhardt: So, the ability to provide telemedicine or remote medicine support is something that is very useful but is limited by communications. So, one of our jobs at ExMC is to start trying to develop ways for our crews, our astronauts, to become more Earth-independent, so that they can do their job and take care of themselves if we can't help them.  Host: Sounds like they're going to have to do that for everything, not just their medical care. But yeah, how do you do that? Do you just -- do you send crews who are made up entirely of doctors?  Kris Lehnhardt: As a doctor, that sounds fine to me.  Host: I know you're in line. [laughter] I know you're in line, but that -- [laughter] I mean, do they have to be medical professionals, or is the training that they can get over the course of getting ready going to be sufficient to let engineers and scientists go, too?  Kris Lehnhardt: In order to accomplish the mission, we have to send more than doctors. That's for certain. Right now, NASA intends to send a doctor on a mission to Mars, but there's always a chance that that doctor is the one who becomes sick or injured. So, you have to have a more robust capability than that. So, what we need to do is, we need to find ways to not only train and prepare people on the ground to deal with medical emergencies and maintain health and performance. We need to give them all the tools that they need in-mission to try and help themselves. And so, that includes different things like procedure support. So, we are developing a module right now, software module that we're going to fly to the space station in the spring, and what that module is going to do is, it's going to guide astronauts to perform their own ultrasounds on each other without talking to the ground, and without medical training. So, we're looking at trying to develop all of the tools they're going to need to take care of themselves that will augment whatever their training and preparation was on the ground before they left.  Host: As you think about the fact that they're going to be gone so far away, which also means they're going to be gone for such a long period of time, and they're going to have to learn how to be more self-sufficient, entirely-self-sufficient, because Houston -- Earth can't talk to them. That -- you really have to have them fully prepared to -- as if it were going to be a one-way trip. They've got to be able to take care of themselves.  Nancy Fleming: They have to be able to take care of themselves. Absolutely, they do. And so, again, one of our approaches is enabling them to take care of themselves with a training module, so that they can do refresher training, or just-in-time training. And software will lend itself very well to that, just like with our ultrasound technology that we're developing for them right now. But we are. They will have to become self-sufficient. They're going to become more like explorers that we think of from the past, like Shackleton, or those types of folks who really did go exploring and were in hostile environments. And they had to depend on themselves for their health, and maintenance, and survival, and we are expecting them to thrive, not just survive.  Host: Sure, sure. Now, we referenced this before, and I wanted to get back to it. You talk about the planning that you're doing, and the trade-offs that you're trying to work out about what things you -- they -- you can bring, you need to bring, are most important to bring, are vital, or just luxuries. What kind of variables do you guys have to weigh in this equation to figure out -- to figure out what fits there? I mean, one thing, I realize, is the size of the spacecraft, and you're not building the spacecraft. But they're saying, \"Here's the size of the closet that you get to fill up.\" What do you have to -- give me a sense of the discussions that you all have, and the variables that you look at in trying to determine what goes and what can't.  Kris Lehnhardt: You're absolutely right that when most people talk about the constraints, we talk about the mass, and the volume, and the power that each individual device or piece of technology's going to have. But the other things that are less talked about, but equally important -- one is data. How are we going to manage the flow of all of this information back and forth? If it requires huge amounts of data to be transmitted to Earth, for people on the ground to interpret, and then send back to the astronauts what to do with that information, maybe that's not the best solution. The other thing that we are also looking at are the -- what are going to be the knowledge, skills, and abilities of the crew? If we send a piece of equipment that is designed to be used by a highly-experienced physician, and that person is the person who is sick or injured --  Host: And then not capable of doing it.  Kris Lehnhardt: -- and not capable of doing it, how are the other crew members going to be able to use that equipment? And so, we don't want to send something on a mission to Mars that people are not going to be able to use effectively, because that, again, is a wasted resource. So, we have to weigh the mass, power, and volume, which are the typical things we talk about on spacecraft, but the data, and the knowledge, and the training are equally important.  Nancy Fleming: And the way that we're doing that is, we're building a tool, a model. As you know, a lot of science relies on models to calculate and predict, or capture trends and patterns, and weigh probabilities. And so, one of the key areas of focus that we are doing is building a model that can run all of these complex computations to make the trades even with inputs. So, we can give it a mass constraint, or a power constraint, or a volume constraint, or a data constraint, and we can have it run through a variety of algorithms. And it will help us define what our options are for an optimized medical system. So, we're using math to do that.  Host: Yeah. It's a good thing you have some mathematicians that are available. [laughter] But what are the -- what are the variables that you're considering, that you're building into these algorithms? What are you trying to protect against, or ensure?  Kris Lehnhardt: That's one of the hardest challenges that we have, is trying to predict what's going to occur. And so, the best way that we do that is not only using previous spaceflight data -- so the last 20 years of people on the ISS has given us lots of great information about what kinds of conditions may occur. But we're also trying to use other information that we can get on the ground, from analogues, from similar situations. So, we look at how people provide medical care in remote locations like Antarctica, what happens on a submarine that can't surface and is under the water for weeks at a time. How do they provide medical care? There are also analogue populations on the ground of people who are similar to astronauts, and we can study what happens to them over time and use that information to extrapolate what's going to happen to our astronauts. So, we're trying to take all of that data and incorporate it into our models and perform our risk analysis to come up with a list of the most likely conditions that are going to occur, and we use that list to help define what our medical system is going to be able to provide care for.  Host: I would assume that you're trying to design a system that could provide whatever medical care they need.  Nancy Fleming: Absolutely. [laughter]  Host: We're not drawing a line that says, \"We'll be able to take care of you up to this point, and if you get something worse, too bad.\"  Kris Lehnhardt: One of the challenges that we have is that, at the end of the day, we are going to be constrained in what we can take, and we're going to have to make some hard decisions. But we want our astronauts to be able to use parts of our system in flexible ways. We want them to improvise, and be prepared for the unexpected, because one of the things we have learned on the space station is that things occur that we were not predicting.  Host: Yeah.  Kris Lehnhardt: And the more time we have people spending in space, and the more people who go to space, the more data we get to tell us about that.  Host: Right.  Kris Lehnhardt: And a great example is a recent paper just came out that was published that talks about an astronaut who had a blood clot. No one was anticipating blood clots in astronauts. We did not have a capability to treat that problem within our models. So, the more time we spend in space, the more people we send to space, the better the data is that we can use to make our predictions going forward.  Host: I'm aware that Human Research Program is involved with running a lot of different analogues -- not just natural analogues, like Antarctica, but ones that have been built here to try to gather some data. Have they been fruitful for you?  Kris Lehnhardt: Those analogues -- one of the great things that we can study in those environments is how different people work together. And one of the things we know for an exploration crew, like the astronauts going to Mars, is that they are going to have to be a highly effective team. And if a medical emergency is going to occur, how are the people in that environment going to respond to that emergency? How are they going to know what to do, what procedures to follow, and how are they going to execute on that training that they've had to take care of their sick or injured crew member? Because those folks -- they train for years together. They become like family to each other. So, if you could imagine what it'd be like, trying to provide medical care to someone in your family if they have a medical event, and you do it in a really difficult environment -- we need to know how they're going to respond. And so, using these analogues on the ground to study how people respond in these kinds of circumstances are going to help us to develop better procedures that the astronauts going to Mars can use.  Host: I think it's important to point out, too, that NASA's not doing all this work on its own. You guys are involved with a lot of people outside the gates here in trying to build this up. Tell me about that.  Nancy Fleming: Sure. We have agreements with other federal agencies. As I mentioned earlier, we're working with federal drug administration to help us with our pharmaceutical studies. We have been -- we've asked the Mayo Clinic for -- we're working with the Mayo Clinic to gather incidence rates for conditions. We also work with international partners. We have agreements with Canadian Space Agency, and HRP as a whole works with the European Space Agency. We were working with them on a technology demonstration coming up soon, in the next year, for a medical device as well. And so, as with anything, the more diverse minds and capabilities you bring to solve a problem, the greater outcome you get of that solution. And so, we have partnerships -- in fact, our teams of scientists, and clinicians, and engineers are stationed all over the United States. We have virtual teams that are part of our element.  Host: They're not all just working here in Houston.  Nancy Fleming: They're not here. They're not all here at Johnson Space Center. They're at other space centers, and they're at just remote locations.  Host: As you do this work, try to figure out what is needed, what sort of communications are you still having with the people who are building the spaceships, in order to make sure that plans that -- you know, I have a genius plan, but it won't work on this vehicle. I mean, you don't want to get into that position. So how do you still work with the spaceship builders?  Kris Lehnhardt: We have a team that works within our element that is focused on systems engineering, and what you're describing is exactly that. What we are trying to do is develop the information that vehicle designers and mission planners are going to need early on in their plans, so they can incorporate a crew health and performance system into their spaceships, essentially. And so, the model you described earlier, where someone says, \"Here's the closet. You can fill the closet with whatever you want\" -- we are actually trying to change that paradigm to one where a crew health and performance system is integrated into the spacecraft, like every other system is. So, if the spacecraft provides oxygen to the crew members, which it hopefully does in order for them to live --  Host: It does. [laughter]  Kris Lehnhardt: -- then --  Host: As I understand it --  Kris Lehnhardt: -- why, as a -- on the medical side, should I have to have separate oxygen for medical purposes? If the vehicle already does that, I need to leverage that capability from the vehicle. And all I need to do is provide an interface between the vehicle and the patient. So, the integration and the systems engineering functions that our group is doing is trying to influence these programs early on in their development, so that we can have those systems, that crew health and performance system, as part of the spacecraft.  Nancy Fleming: And one of the ways that we do that -- our systems engineering team -- is using model-based systems engineering. And in fact, our systems engineering team is working -- is part of an agency initiative, headquarters initiative that is trying to infuse model-based systems engineering in all of the future programs. And so, we are working at the forefront of the agency towards that goal. Our team has created -- has a model, and has created requirements, concepts of operations, functional decomposition of those requirements, so that when any -- a program like Artemis comes online, that they have something to start from for the requirements to build their spacecraft.  Host: In general, if it can be said, when you think about crews on two-year-long, three-year-long missions, are you thinking that they are more likely to get a cold, or, you know, have an old back injury flare up, as opposed to break an arm or something? Is there a certain kind of thing that you've come to believe is more likely to happen?  Kris Lehnhardt: As I said before, the biggest challenge is probably trying to predict the unpredictable. But we also know, as I said before, that these are all normal people, and we try to send up as healthy of people as we can. But at the end of the day, they have a lot of the same problems that we have. They have backaches, and headaches, and rashes, and we have to be able to manage those kind of more minor problems to prevent them from becoming more serious problems. The other kinds of issues that they are -- that they could have, that we people have on the ground, we try to prevent or screen out before we send them. So, we ideally don't want to send someone to space that's going to have a heart attack, or a stroke, but at the end of the day, because we can't predict everything that's going to occur, we need to have a list of capabilities that we can take with us, that are going to manage a wide variety of conditions. So, our goal, ultimately, is to develop that list of conditions and capabilities so we can design the system necessary to treat them. History has shown us that lots of different things can occur. Apollo 13 is a great example of someone who became sick and was completely unpredicted from happening.  Host: Right.  Kris Lehnhardt: And it turns out that, even when that person did become sick, we didn't have the capability onboard to effectively treat them. So, it was a good thing they were already on their way home again. We don't want that to happen on the way to Mars.  Host: Right, and -- but it's -- you know, it certainly could, and you're trying to come up with a way to -- that those people can take care of themselves. Because once they take off for Mars, they can't turn around and come back for years, literally years. In an earlier podcast segment, Jennifer Fogarty, your boss, talked about not only developing things that people will need, but also a decision support culture. And that strikes me as being really important. You're sending some people out there on their own to take care of themselves, and this is a way that we can help them after they're gone.  Nancy Fleming: That is true, and for ExMC, we have just started our decision support research. We want to ensure that the crews have the capability to be able to rely on the information from the ground, and the technologies that can help them decide between two illnesses or help them decide which pieces of equipment are the best things to use to solve this -- to help with this illness, or this injury. And so, we have kicked off research to develop decision support. That is a key component to having crews being able to take care of themselves on their way to Mars.  Host: And it struck me, too, that it's a way to give them some confidence that what they're doing is the right thing to do --  Nancy Fleming: Yes.  Host: -- as they take care of themselves. This is fascinating, and I wish you luck as you continue to do it. Nancy Fleming and Kris Lehnhardt, thank you very much.  Nancy Fleming: Thank you.  Kris Lehnhardt: Thank you.  [ Music ]  Host: If you're like me, and you watch some science fiction movies and television, and you can come away thinking that most of the problems of human spaceflight are pretty easy to solve -- once you get better shielding technology and artificial gravity locked in, and then I think we'll find that a lot of the medical questions will pretty much solve themselves. But until then, hearing Nancy Fleming and Kris Lehnhardt talk about working through the real problems facing humans trying to live out from under the safety of our atmosphere is terrifically interesting.

                        "description": "Gary Jordan (Host): Houston, we have a podcast. Welcome to the official podcast of the NASA Johnson Space Center, Episode 126, “Fighting Space Effects.” I'm Gary Jordan, I'll be your host today. On this podcast we bring in the experts, scientists, engineers, astronauts, all to let you know what's going on in the world of human spaceflight. This is part four of our six-part series on the Human Research Program. Today we're going to focus on the Human Health Countermeasures Element. One of the five teams at NASA Johnson Space Center working on finding the best methods and technology to support safe productive human space travel, but more specifically seeking to understand the physiological effects of spaceflight, the effects on astronaut health. Giving you further insight into human health countermeasures is Laura Bollweg, Element Manager and Dr. Peter Norsk, Element Scientist and a professor at the Center for Space Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine. Together they lead the group that lends biomedical expertise for the development and assessment in areas such as medical standards, vehicle and spacesuit requirements and countermeasures, which are ways to preemptively fight the effects of space, like for example exercising. And all of this is done to ensure crew health during all phases of flight and to prepare for missions deeper into space. So here we go. The intricacies of what we're doing to fight the effects of space on human health with Laura Bollweg and Dr. Peter Norsk. Enjoy!  [ Music ]  Host: Laura and Peter, thank you so much for coming on Houston, We Have a Podcast today.  Laura Bollweg: Thanks for inviting us. It's a pleasure to be here.  Peter Norsk: Yeah, me too. Thank you very much.  Host: So today we're going to be talking about human health countermeasures. Now, I'm going to start it by asking, and this might be a stupid question, but what's a countermeasure?  Peter Norsk: A countermeasure is a procedure or an equipment to be used against the negative effects of spaceflight on the human body. So, an example is, if you are prone to fainting after spaceflight, on the ground you would have -- you do something in order to make the body resistant to gravity. One example is you use a garment that compresses the lower part of the body and keeps fluid and blood in the upper part of the brain's perfuse and you drink salt and water before landing. That's a countermeasure that consists of sill items.  Host: OK, so it's a way of preventing something from happening, or I guess a response to some effect of spaceflight.  Peter Norsk: Yes, any negative health effects or something that affects performance in a negative fashion for the mission.  Host: OK, so would sitting on my butt and watching TV all day, a countermeasure to fight the amount of TV I want to watch would be work out every once in a while?  Peter Norsk: Yes.  Host: OK, alright. That's the way I like to think about it at least.  Peter Norsk: Or you could simply shut off the TV and do something sensible.  Host: What are you trying to say Peter? [laughing]  Laura Bollweg: And a countermeasure can have a certain protocol to it. So, you could have a certain exercise regime.  Host: OK, yeah, there you go. Alright, so to get into countermeasures and fully understand what you do for this particular element of human research, let’s go into your backgrounds. Laura, why don't you start? What's your background and how does it relate to countermeasures?  Laura Bollweg: Sure, I'm a mechanical engineer from University of Akron and I came to NASA as an intern working shuttle training propulsion. And then over time I changed to teach the International Space Station and was a project manager for developing the simulator for the first ISS crew and trained the second class for the first ISS crew. So, it's been a long time. And so, I really appreciate spaceflight at operational aspects. And so, I wanted to come to the Human Research Program to get early in the program, to really make a difference in changing things before the vehicle is built, before things are locked down.  Host: Oh Ok. Yeah, because you said you were training crew, so naturally you have that human interaction when it comes to how people interpret how to train with certain things, so you have that human element. And incorporating that ahead of time, naturally, makes sense, right? You want to design something that maybe might not be, or might -- you know, instead of designing something that is the most efficient for what it is to do, it's the most efficient, but with incorporating that human factor in it.  Laura Bollweg: Absolutely. With countermeasures we don't think about just our specific element, we think about the big picture. So, we might think about human factors, how that plays into the countermeasure, so it's not just a physiological, but physiological and human factors together.  Host: OK, now Peter, what about you? What's your background?  Peter Norsk: Well, I'm an MD from the University of Copenhagen, but I actually started my space interest long before that when I was ten years of age in '63 watching or actually listening to at that time, John Glenn doing his first orbits around the Earth and that inspired me for my whole life. And when I became and MD, I looked up a certain research group and there was only one for space medicine, because Denmark is a pretty small country. So, we were the only ones. And I worked in that group and kind of became the leader of that group for many, many years before I came to NASA about nine years ago. So, before that I did the research on the space station, before that on the Russian Space Station Mir, and before that again on the shuttles, so cardiovascular research, understanding fundamentals of gravity and microgravity on the cardiovascular system.  Host: Very important research. So, you did research on, you have kind of an understanding of what's happening to the human body in space and naturally you being part of a countermeasures part of things, it's figuring out ways and how to counteract that.  Peter Norsk: Yeah, in Europe it was more fundamental understanding the basic adjustment and adaptation of the cardiovascular system to weightlessness. So, when I came to NASA it was more kind of using that knowledge, as well as artificial knowledge to counteract the negative health effects of spaceflight. So that's why I actually went to NASA to have a more applied approach.  Host: OK, now it's worth mentioning, Peter, that you've been on the podcast before. Me and you had a great discussion on we were going through the hazards of human spaceflight and we talked about exactly what you're talking about, how gravity effects the human body in space. I think the last, and this might be an update, correct me if I'm wrong, but you are now a professor at the Center for Space Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine.  Peter Norsk: Yeah, that's correct.  Host: Alright, well congratulations.  Peter Norsk: Thank you very much.  Host: How do you split your time? How do you do professor and do NASA research? Or are they very much interwoven?  Peter Norsk: Totally.  Peter Norsk: OK. And that's why, it requires a little more work too because I have to do lectures and papers that I didn't do before in my capacity as professor at Baylor College of Medicine. But I enjoy doing it and it actually improves my work at NASA administering scientifically to build with Laura the Human Health Countermeasures Program, Project, actually Human Health Countermeasure Element in the Human Research Program. [Laughter] I'm learning, you know, still learning the acronyms and how things work, but I think I'm getting them.   Host: Yeah, me too. I'm always learning. Now let's get into it. Let's go into exactly what you guys are doing. Human Health Countermeasures, Laura, what is this organization? What are you focusing on with it?   Laura Bollweg: Well, Peter and I co-lead the element. Peter develops the scientific strategies. So, everything we do is based on sound, scientific thought and principles. And then we work together to turn those into an implementation plan. And so, the implementation is a little bit more in my side of things. So, he challenges me on a daily basis on how to get the most science in with the research platforms that we have available, including the International Space Station. But we have research platforms on the ground as well.  Host: OK. So, let's go into, I guess, the implementation a little bit more. What is it exactly that you are implementing? What are the things you're focusing on to figure out what these countermeasures, what countermeasures we need for successful spaceflight?  Laura Bollweg: So, based on his scientific strategy, we put together something that might -- for example, if the countermeasure is projected to be hardware, then put together a hardware validation plan to make sure that the hardware will work. So, we've got enough things in the schedule, enough resources, enough of the right skill sets pulling in, so that at the end of the day when it's time to deliver it to the right program, the hardware or software or whatever the countermeasure is, it's gone through rigorous engineering thought process.  Host: OK, so Peter, Laura mentioned that the decisions made on what to implement has to be based on sound science. So how do you define that? What is the sound science that you're looking at?  Peter Norsk: Well, science is one of those mystic words where by you can hide behind and seem very clever and nobody understands what you actually mean. So, people use this word erroneously many times. Science just means knowledge you can trust. That's it. So how do I gain knowledge I can trust? Meaning, it has been all kinds of questions as to when you got this knowledge, you measure it, what are the inaccuracies? Did you take this and that into account? I mean take that into consideration and controlling for all the unknowns is good science. So, my job is to make sure that we are following the best practice of science that's already being done in the United States particular, but part in the western world, making sure that those procedures are used also at NASA at an adequate level, even better maybe. And also making sure that these best practices are then being implemented into. If it is something on ISS, in an analog in the best way, and that's where Laura helps me making sure that is happening because she knows how to do that. I don't know that. I know what the best practice is, what kind of science and questions we have to ask, she knows what can be done or not be done, how to keep it on schedule. That's very important with me because I'm always out of schedule. I don't keep the schedule. But she does. And also making sure, you know, that you can actually try this experiment on the ISS. If I wish to bring up an elephant instead of a mouse to test something, she would tell me, \"That's not possible.\" As for having a giraffe, she would say, \"No.\" And then we end up with human beings or whatever. So, this is kind of the practical way of doing things that the management system actually makes excellent contributions.  Host: So, great science naturally, that has to be done on the International Space Station.  Peter Norsk: Yeah, the problem is that best science, you know we know it's my job to know how to do that in general.  Host: Sure.  Peter Norsk: But how it ends up is sometimes different because you have constraints doing, you know space science also very operational. There are very many unknowns, there are other considerations. The management system may not always -- engineering or leadership system, may not always know, you know not be able to implement the best practices, so we have to compromise and find out where that it makes the whole thing worthwhile or not. So that's where actually the most difficult decisions sometimes.  Host: So, Laura, what are the constraints of spaceflight that make maybe doing research on the International Space Station a little bit harder?  Laura Bollweg: Well, I think Peter alluded to it. There's size, you know is it something that is possible to do on the International Space Station, is it the weight? The schedule? We normally have our proposals about 18 months before, so there's enough time to work through the implementation. There's also, typically we don't think about a particular study. We often are thinking of a series of studies and how they come together to answer specific milestones. And so, it's not just study-by-study, but is there enough, I think a lot of the implementation is, is there enough time to get the research questions we need answered while we have ISS available? It's an important platform for long duration. And so, we need to make sure that the research gets done during the time frame we have this important research platform.  Host: Yeah, time -- that the research platform will exist as a platform, but I'm sure time is also a constraint when it comes to astronauts. Right, you're not the only ones trying to do research on the International Space Station. You have to make sure that it's going to be something that the astronauts will be able to conduct in their own very tight schedules, something I know is a big constraint. So naturally, you know you can't do a bunch of -- you can't do everything that you want on the International Space Station, where else could you test some of the countermeasures that you would like to do?  Peter Norsk: Well we have something called analogs. A new word I actually learned when I came to NASA, we called kind of simulation models in Europe. And we simulated the effects of weightlessness by for the major parts by using head down bed rest. Unloading the body and shifting the fluid upwards by a slight two to six degrees head down. And that is being used because you can do it for long durations. Not as long as on the ISS, but maybe for 60, 90 days. And it gives you a lot of the effects physiologically that you will see during unloading during weightlessness. There are limitations to the model, but you can actually exploit those limitations in understanding more the mechanisms if you know what are the differences from that simulation model to actually what's happening in weightlessness and seeing differences in outcomes of physiological variables. So, it's a good model. Head out water immersion has also been used, but only for short periods. In Russia they did it for -- you know, floating water is actually being very much like weightlessness, and they've done it for a couple of weeks, but it's a very difficult model because you can't measure many things underwater. It's more difficult than doing it in space actually.  Host: Oh wow.  Peter Norsk: But these are dry immersion is a model whereby you are not getting wet research, but it's still much more complicated to do research being submersed in water. Even though it's dry immersion with a sheet protecting the body against the water, but still with the water pressure around your body. And so, we have chosen to do the head down bed rest study as an analog.  Host: So what questions are you asking in these analogs that specifically relate to countermeasures?  Peter Norsk: We have selected the official article systems that are susceptible to unloading. So that would be the musculoskeletal system, and muscles, bone because you unload it from feet to head, but you still load it actually from front to back, but it's much less than when you're upright and walking. And so, if you are recumbent, inactive in a bed rest setting with a few shifts, you can see many of the aspects of demineralization of the bones, as well as atrophy of the muscles. And then using certain exercise techniques, you know how precision on a treadmill with loading the springs you can actually simulate what's going on, on the treadmill on ISS. And there by see how efficient your countermeasures work and protect bone and muscle. So that's one thing that's a very kind of big thing. And we have been very successful with that. But you have to test it finally on ISS after doing it in an analog. But you can prepare for it and you can prepare for the best prescription to be tested on ISS to save crew time. And then also, understanding the fluid shift, the magnitude of the fluid shift into the head, because as you probably will know, and this is our top priority to understand, why the increase pressure in the head of the fluids effect the eye and how it effects the eye and the brain. So, we are doing that. Now we can also do that in a bed rest setting. This is a very recent breakthrough. Actually, since the last podcast that we can create manifestations of those ocular changes called the Spaceflight Associated Neuro-ocular Syndrome, very complicated. The SANS syndrome that is how it affects the eye and the vision, we can do that in bed rest, and use it as a precursor and an analog for spaceflight.  Host: Wow. So OK, now what about, and this you were thinking about, you mentioned something that's sort of recent from the last podcast.  Peter Norsk: Very recent. This is a breakthrough. It's a big thing for us. Because using an analog saves time on ISS and we can prepare much better countermeasure testing than we could before.  Host: So, let's talk about the time it takes to put together an experiment and ask the right questions. You know, what's happening to the human body is naturally is a good one, and you have that in space, so what's happening. That process from going from that point, what's happening, to the process of how can we mitigate this problem? How can we fix it? What does that look like?  Peter Norsk: Well, you know that's -- how long it takes to get it implemented to ISS is a different issue. So, the whole thing for whole experiment, well I think we -- there's an experiment called the fluid shift, which is understanding the relationship between the shift of fluids in microgravity and the ocular, you know the vision changes, the sight changes of the eye. And that started when I came in 2011. We selected it. And it’s just a -- I think it's just about to be -- it's just being completed in data collection in space and it's not completed as a study yet. So, it takes apparently up to nine years before it's published. I can give you another example. I did an experiment myself before I came to NASA and into my employment in NASA and that started in 2006 and ended in '15 as a publication. Again, nine years. So, it takes about nine years for a full study.  Host: Wow.  Peter Norsk: So, it takes a long time but it's not the same. In laboratory work, in normal Earth-bound setting, it takes much shorter, but that's because of the access to astronauts is more limited. I think we can test about how many astronauts there, Laura, on an annual basis? About two or three.  Laura Bollweg: Maybe four or five.  Peter Norsk: Maybe four or five sometimes.  Laura Bollweg: It depends how many sign up to do that experiment that particular year.  Peter Norsk: Yeah, so sometimes it takes a long time. Sometimes it goes fast. It differs.  Host: OK, now you mentioned astronauts signing up. This is, you know, this might be -- actually I forget if we've mentioned this on a recent podcast, but you know you can’t force astronauts to do everything that you want them to do. So, what does that process look like from when you have an idea, when you have some experiment that you want to finally get up on the International Space Station and getting them to conduct the experiment?  Laura Bollweg: Well, first all the research goes through a review board. So, they look at it and determine if it's reasonable, if the risk is reasonable, if the science they want to collect makes sense and is safe. And then after the research is selected by the Human Research Program to go to flight, it is presented to the crew members for them to decide if they want to participate or not.  Host: OK, so when you have this review board and you're looking at different experiments that you want to conduct, have a lot of them already been done on the ground and tested in some capacity and you want to now move them up to spaceflight? Or maybe they're brand new and that's something that's very interesting and they want to fly it?  Peter Norsk: Well, partly yes and partly no.  Host: OK.  Peter Norsk: So, if you take one study, again like the fluid shift would be one of our highest prioritized studies, it consists of several sub-studies with different principle investigators for each. So, we select the three and combine them into one. So, each of those, you know the procedures, the measurements have been tested in a laboratory setting very thoroughly by these investigators and this is actually the reason they were selected probably because they have a lot of experience. But what is new is to combine them and use them in either analog setting or in space. And that is totally different from on Earth and therefore it's new every time and it's something that's very exciting the first time we do an experiment. And you actually have to count on having failure in the first couple of experiments before it becomes routine for the whole system. But usually it works out very well. We do have some setbacks, you know with equipment that doesn't work at some point in time because it's a very tight schedule, you have to measure this particular variable at this particular time because they have everything set up minute by minute basis or five minute by five minute basis, something like that. And if they fail they have to come back to it and use least time for doing it maybe. So that postpones things to some degree, but not very much. It's actually extremely impressive how it works for NASA in space, extremely impressive. I am still impressed. And it's actually because of what Laura and her team and everybody else with that background actually do. Because they have the experience from many, many decades of implementation that makes it possible. And that is also why they push back on the sciences like me, who think we can do everything in space and we can't. So that is extremely important for success.  Host: Alright, well if you keep asking for elephants it's going to go that route.  Peter Norsk: Yeah, we gave up that one, giraffe, you know it's very interesting because the giraffe is a very good model for the understanding extreme fluid shift on Earth, because when the giraffe lowers its head it's in danger of having brain edema, so it has to use certain mechanisms in order to avoid having too high a pressure in the brain. We do have a smaller problem, but it does exist in weightlessness with a too high of a pressure in the brain as well. And we are concerned about the extradition, the fluid into some brain structures, as well as the eye, and that's what we're looking into. It's not the same as a giraffe, of course, but the model is just more extreme in that regard. So that's why we have actually looked in, we hadn't done any studies per se from NASA, but we have looked into the data that's been done already on giraffes in Africa to understand some of those.  Host: So, looking into some of the past, some of what we have learned from previous spaceflight, and I guess we can incorporate outside of spaceflight and what we understand about these shifting fluids, maybe in like you said, other species, that relate to spaceflight. How have we grown through time?  Peter Norsk: I think we have improved tremendously. We are using a lot of clinical disease models, investigations in patients in order to understand some of the symptoms of spaceflight. It's not the same, because astronauts are extremely healthy, they're selected to be healthy, and they go to space and see some of the same changes as we see in patients, but it's not the same in total because they are not sick. I mean even in space they are totally healthy, but they have some of the same manifestations but not fully. One example again, if you look into the eye changes, the vision changes in space, it actually resembles, and for a long time we thought it was the same, it resembles an increase pressure in the brain in certain patients. It's called idiopathic intracranial hypertension. So too high of a pressure because of some food disturbances in the production of spinal fluid. And so that's in some patients will increase. They do have vision changes also, some of them. So, we thought it was the same thing, but it turns out that when you compare certain measures during spaceflight, with that patient but it's not the same. And the manifestations are also a little bit different in the eye. So, you have some similarities, some differences. We still use patient models to understand differences to understand the mechanisms of spaceflight and I just tell you it will be a surprise every time. And we are still being surprised by what is actually happening with the fluid distribution in space, which we didn't know before just a few years before. I'm talking about right now. So, spaceflight is unique in that regard.  Host: So, Laura, when it comes to what I'm hearing is, you know you can study fluid shifts, but you have to do it from all of these different perspectives. You have to look at history, you have to maybe bring in other species and maybe if you look at all of these different angles something might surprise you along the way. So, what is human health countermeasures doing to manage all of the driving forces that Peter keeps coming to you with, and \"Oh I want to do all of this research.\" What do you do to manage and prioritize what's important and what we're going to focus on?  Laura Bollweg: That's an excellent question. We look at strategic planning and not just implementation of specific studies but look at a series of studies. And what we do is really novel. If you look around the world, there really is no place that strategically takes a series of studies, plans it out as a project with milestones that consider where do we go next? So, we have what we call decision points where we stop and think where do we want to go next based on the findings we have and then carve out a path forward. There really is no place that I know of in the world that takes that approach, that takes the scientific rigor and puts management milestone rigors with it so that we can deliver on time with validated countermeasures. And so that's one of the reasons I'm really excited to be in the Human Research Program is because, there's a lot of excellent research that's done with (National Institutes of Health) NIH, but really the stepping stone approach in putting all the resources together in a very funneled way, to produce real countermeasures is something novel and special that we have at NASA.  Host: So, it sounds like that integration at combining these elements are really important to have those checks and balances of the science and the management aspects of things. What really peaked my interest though is when you were saying that if you're looking further out, right, you can only plan so far because when it comes to science something might surprise you. And you say, you might have to carve out another path because something might come up and say this is very interesting, we should dedicate resources in the resource in the future to investigating this path and going down that way. So, what is that like from planning perspective of planning and integrating all of these things but doing it to a certain point that has to include a certain amount of flexibility when it comes to discovering new things.  Laura Bollweg: Yes, each year we get a chance to re-plan. And again, we have these decision points where we can stop and pause, Peter and other scientists can review all the scientific findings. And if the assumptions that went into our plan and our resources aren't valid anymore, we can bring that story forward. That's something that the Human Research Program really encourages us to do is to be able to change our path if the science does surprise us, or I should say when the science surprises us.  Host: Yeah, so naturally being, you know human health countermeasures, we're going through all the elements of the Human Research Program, you've mentioned human research program. We're going through all of these elements. They're not siloed right? You're not making your own decisions and going up your own little chain. There is crosstalk with all of the other elements to make sure that everyone's in line. And I think one of the more interesting things that we've discovered or at least talked about in some of these recent podcasts is that you can come up with an idea for a countermeasure, something you may realize maybe we should implement this, and this is the best way to counter these possible effects. But then you discover that these countermeasures produce their own side effects and now you have to investigate those and make sure that it's not going to affect too much downstream. So, what is that like relationship wise, with all of the other elements and making sure that you're talking to one another and realizing the effects of these decisions?  Laura Bollweg: We definitely have integrated projects where we're working on a same goal with other elements. In fact, I was the element manager for Human Factors and Behavioral Performance and have recently moved to Human Health Countermeasures. So, we definitely are well integrated. And just like other managers have done this cross training, we are familiar with the other areas and then we organized these projects. I don't know if you want to mention the [Cognitive Behavioral Sensory] CBS project as one of the scientific projects that we --  Peter Norsk: Yeah, that's one very good example of integration between disciplines. So, we have three different disciplines being integrated in that project. One is all the sensory motor work. We are doing sensory motor means the balance system and the relationship between what you see, what you feel balance wise in the inner ear, as well as what you feel from your limbs and muscles, integrated into keeping balance. I mean walking as a human being shouldn't be possible when you look at it because it should be very easy just one side or back and forth because you're very long compared to the support of your feet. But because of the sensory motor system and the nervous system and regulations in the balance system, you can keep your balance all the time. Now, that's more difficult after spaceflight, so that's one issue we have that you are totally confused and like a drunk person who has been drinking too much after spaceflight. They hadn't been drinking, just to make sure, but it looks like it sometimes. And therefore, we want to mitigate that. That's one exam. So that is now being integrated into research with everything that's going on in the brain, apart from that particular issue, you know cognition, as well as perception and memory and things like that, behavior. And so that, we are combining those two pieces of research and then we also, so we are looking into the behavioral sciences, a sensory motor, and the cerebral structural changes of the brain in one part in order to understand interaction between the different systems. So actually, this is very interesting for me because before I came to NASA I had never worked together with behavioral scientist or psychologist. And actually, as a medical doctor, you don't really regard these people as anything right. And then you come to NASA and you see what they are doing is very, very important for the brain function and for your balance system. So, we worked together on a day-by-day basis and there's a structure for that at NASA to do that, so that's created by managers like Laura and her colleagues, which scientists would never invent. Scientists are very siloed and very focused on their own performance. They're also very selfish. Now this is taken out of the sciences at NASA by the management system make much better science. So, I think everybody agrees it's a good thing, but you have to be forced to it sometimes. And that works very well and it actually limits resources being spent. It makes it more efficient. You have better science this way. But it's also, it can be difficult at times to have people understanding how to work together but that's management.  Host: So, when you're working together, and you are trying to come up with decisions for the future on what things to implement for spaceflight when it comes to human health countermeasures, what specific countermeasures parts do you actually take to the table and try to enforce? Or what is your perspective when brining that to the table?  Peter Norsk: The perspective is that you do the research to understand first what's going on. The next thing is what are the mechanisms? The third thing is that based on that how big is the risk? And then fourthly, how do we mitigate if it is necessary? And the mitigation is the treatment against it or the counteraction of what that weightlessness does to that system. So, one example again, is you have fluids to the head increase pressure in the eye. And you are not only concerned about the vision changes but permanent damage to the eye and some parts of the brain. You have to move the fluid back. How do we do that in space? Well, one way of doing it is maybe to draw it back by sub pressure around the lower body to keep the drawing the fluid back. And if you maybe do that intermittently at some point in time it may be enough or not enough to mitigate the effects of those manifestations. That's a countermeasure. That will be a box around the lower body that has to be delivered to NASA to fly in deep space to mitigate this issue if it appears in the person. So that's one vision for that. It's more complicated than that. This just being simple. All the garment and the fluid loading after landing so people don't faint, because of the orthostatic intolerance. It could be we have immune changes in space where by the confined environment and the stressful environment induces changes to the immune system that makes us more susceptible to infections and allergic reactions. So, if that's too much and effects performance, we have to mitigate that by nutritional countermeasures, better food, maybe some pharmacological agents, some medication that is not harmful. Aspirin actually helps a little bit, as well as some other medication and then also changing the procedures, the operational environment so that the stress fullness is less on each individual. So, things like that.  Host: OK. It seems like there's -- I like the steps that you kind of laid out, kind of figuring out what's the problem, understanding the mechanisms. You mentioned risks. And it seems like one of the biggest parts that this organization contributes to is that next part. Once you identify a risk and identify maybe how impactful it is to the success of the mission, this is where you start investigating, well how can we counteract this risk?  Peter Norsk: Yeah, we have two sets of -- you know we have the health that can create, you know you have effective weightlessness during long time can create some effects on maybe bone demonization that lasts forever and then that's detrimental for a lifetime if you don't mitigate in flight. So that's one health risk that has to be mitigated for ethical reasons as well. And then you have performance, decrements performance, that's not really a health risk but makes your -- endangers the mission because your performance too low and therefore you have to mitigate that also. These are different types of countermeasures. So, the behavioral scientists are very concerned about performance, and we are very much concerned about the risk to health.  Host: To health. That's where the difference is, OK.  Peter Norsk: Yeah, I would say where the sensory motor system and the balance disturbances is more performance oriented because you usually recover a couple of days after landing on a planetary surface. But I mean for those two first days you need to be able to do something in order if something happens. When you land on Mars, you have to be able to get out of the vehicle and into your spacesuit if something happens immediately. And therefore, we had to mitigate that.  Host: OK, so this is where you're starting to understand where these different elements are coming into play. We've already done I think it was part two of this series was on the human factors and behavioral performance. You said they're trying to answer questions that are trying to maximize the performance of these astronauts, but it sounds like when it comes to this organization it's more about making sure that they are going to be healthy throughout all the phases.  Peter Norsk: Yeah. Well, we also work into performance but you're correct. And also, for behavioral scientists they're also concerned about, of course, the damages to the brain that may be health oriented.  Host: So that crosses over?  Peter Norsk: Yeah, yeah. So, it does cross over.  Host: So, when it comes to, Laura, you mentioned some of your past experience with crew training and involving the crew and there was elements of human factors there as well. Coming to Human Research Program and being so close to the science end of things, how has your perspective changed since that previous role and now looking at how the science is done from that end of things?  Laura Bollweg: I think I've gained a lot of respect for our scientific community, the rigorous way they approach things. It can take some time and real thought to follow what their processes are, but it's very rigorous. And so, we have a human system risk board that's independent of the Human Research Program. And what they do is help educate us. It's a team of doctors, astronauts, managers that help characterize for each of our risks what the likelihood of that risk occurring is and what the consequence is for different types of missions. And so, they put colors against our risk and that helps us prioritize. For example, when Peter was talking about the SANS risk, that is considered a red risk and therefore it is a high priority because the likelihood and consequence is considered very serious. And so, I think we have a very rigorous methodology for how we approach things, how we prioritize them, and then solve these challenging questions for exploration.  Host: So yeah, and that's a big key point is when you're categorizing and identifying these risks, you mentioned a couple of them, but when you -- it sounds like there's a red, probably a yellow and a green right? Those are the other ones? But when it's red that would, and correct me if I'm wrong, be a severe risk to the health of the astronaut and perhaps the success of the mission.  Laura Bollweg: Yes, usually it's considered either under operational mission impact or long-term health.  Host: I see, OK.  Peter Norsk: Yeah, these distinctions are very important, but you know it goes together. One example is the degradation of the muscle strengths if you don't exercise probably in space because you are deactivated by weightlessness, that's a fixed both health and performance. So, we need to find out how strong to have to stay in order to perform well enough. You may actually accept some degradation but to a certain level. And defining that is not easy. But that's what we've been doing for a long time. And but also, it's a decrement to health if you have too much degradation of the model because then it's very difficult to reestablish the strains. So, if you get too far down. People in wheelchairs have totally, this use model, you would never be able to re-exercise them back to normal. So, I mean there's both a health and performance aspects of everything we do. The first is performance and then you have effects on health.  Host: OK, so if we're looking at the International Space Station now, we have 20 years, almost 20 years continuously of human habitations, a lot of experience when it comes to astronauts living and working in space for a long time. So, if we were to take a snapshot of today, what countermeasures are in effect now to ensure the health of the crew when they're on six-month missions aboard the International Space Station?  Peter Norsk: Yes. One is the exercise system on ISS is very efficient. It works. It protects bone and muscle pretty well. But the challenge is to have a smaller vehicle going into deep space because you can use that big exercise system, but it works. So, we know that. We didn't know that maybe 20 years ago we didn't know that. So, we know that now and we know what kind of loading we have to expose the body to in order to keep bone and muscle in tact at a level that's acceptable. Another one is the landing avoiding or mitigating fainting by the garment and the fluid loading. This has been totally quantified in detail. It has worked for a long time, but we didn't quite know how well, but now we know it works after long durations of spaceflight. And that will be the countermeasure for orthostatic intolerance in the future. So, these are very, very strong countermeasures. And then you have a countermeasure like, we don't have it for the SANS, which is the most important problem we have right now, but we have ideas that it may be moving fluid from the upper body to the lower body, using not a box but kind of developing a box into a portable structure on the body that can float in space and still be performing well enough with that on, so kind of a suit around the lower part of the body that also back on a continuous basis. But that's a vision. It hasn't been developed yet. And another thing is mitigating and counteracting the immune changes that we see in space. And we have improved a lot of that on ISS. Without ISS the immune problem would still be probably one of the most important ones, but now they're kind of being degraded to a lower level because it turns out that the exercise system, the procedures we are using, the food that they are eating, the medication that they have, but not using regularly but could be, all of that in combination mitigate many of the immune changes and has improved over time that has been shown recently by all these scientists. So, this is very, very promising. But we still have some ways to go in order to make it fully efficient. And then you have a sensory motor system has been totally characterized after flight. So, the balance systems, the confusion, the drunkenness I described it as -- they're not drunk. They don't drink in ISS. Except there were rumors on the Mir space station but I don't think it's true.  Host: OK.    Peter Norsk: They did smoke on Mir, but they didn't drink. So maybe a little bit, I don't know. But on ISS we don't do that. And therefore, so they're not, but I mean that characterization of what systems are affected to what degree, how long it takes to come back to normal with doing nothing, has been extremely available for us to develop the right countermeasure. And the countermeasure now is actually also part of the exercise system and we still need to test some additional countermeasures in order to make it more efficient. We know now also what you need to do preflight, how to train people to have a better balance system even after six months or more of flight. So that is a huge advantage for our future missions, which we didn't have before the ISS. Without the ISS, I don't think it would be possible to go into deep space and Mars. With the 20 years of experience it's now possible to do that.  Host: That is so important and it's actually really coming to light just how important exercise is in all of this. When you were going through all of the countermeasures that are implemented right now, exercise, you got the bone and muscle, check. It helps a little bit with the immune side of things, check. I wouldn't have thought that one before. But countermeasures can come in all these different shapes and sizes. You got the exercise naturally yes, the whole way that astronauts live and work in space, having the exercise in the food and the sleep and everything maybe isn't countermeasured by itself. You mentioned technology. Certain technology to help with making sure they don't faint when they come back, which is huge, right? So, countermeasures can come in all different shapes. It's absolutely fascinating how that all works and is implemented. And I think the biggest takeaway here is the fact that -- and you mentioned this several times, the space station was the key to all of this.  Peter Norsk: Space station was key to all of this and it's been worthwhile to do this because it wouldn't have been possible to go into deep space and Mars without the space station. We still need it by the way. We would like to use it more. It's available at least onto 2025, but I think it needs to be extended beyond that because I have difficulties envisioning that we shouldn't have a platform permanently in orbit around the Earth when we are preparing at the same time to go to the Moon and Mars. But it's of course up to people at higher level than me.  Host: Yeah, a closed platform has been proven to be valuable of course. So, we have all these countermeasures that we know work on the space station because we put them into work now and they're keeping the astronauts pretty healthy. I remember, I forget who we talked to recently, but said that there are some instances where astronauts come back healthier than they, or maybe stronger in a way because of how much they work out, which is pretty awesome.  Peter Norsk: Yeah.  Host: I know there's talk of one-year missions, because you know one of main things that may not be apparent from what we've described so far, how important the International Space Station is, but it's a test platform. It's a great way to test stuff real close, so that when we do go to the Moon and ultimately to Mars that we have a really good understanding of what's happening to the human body. So what additional insights might a one-year mission provide us?  Peter Norsk: Well, one big, big question is duration of spaceflight and duration of being exposed to weightlessness. We know for six months you can prevail and mitigate it with a lot of resources being used to do that. The Russian's have had five persons as we -- five individuals in space for one year or more. The United States has had one close to one year and then it's mostly six months. So, our experience with longer duration flights in six months is very limited. And the research that's been done is very limited. The record was done by Valeri Polyakov in 1995 when he landed in Kazakhstan after 438 days in space in one continuum. And he did very, very well, but he had exercised a lot and he's also a medical doctor who knows what to do or not to do in flight. So that was successful as only one person. And the testing afterwards, but probably also very limited compared to what we would like to do today. So, we are planning for one-year missions in ten subjects in order to have a strong statistical basis for our conclusions. And doing many of the same experiments we've been doing in the past during six months of flight, in order to see if adding six months will make things worse. If so can we mitigate and counteract it with the current countermeasures? Is the exercise efficient? Is the immune changes still be improved or will they be worse? What about the fluid shifts? Will that stay at the same level? Will it be improved or what? We don't know that. And that is pivotal for preparing to go for longer duration in deep space. So it's duration and also creating a baseline for what we will later find and explore in deep space, because when people are going to the Moon and Mars, it will be longer and longer durations and it needs to be compared to low-Earth orbit because the deep space radiation is added to that in deep space, which we don't have now in low-Earth orbit, so you will also see the effects of radiation and  duration in combination at that time. So, with one-year missions around the Earth creating a base line for those tests.  Host: OK, so Laura, how does the countermeasures element, human health countermeasures, how are we taking these ideas, these priorities that we have, you know we really want to do, we really want to test a one-year mission. We want to have all these analog studies that study human health. How do you take all of these ideas and implement in the future both in the analog direction, but then also ultimately in flight to test crew members for long periods of time?  Laura Bollweg: Well, we take all of the scientific strategy and we make a pristine scientific strategy that is understandable by the managers. And then we start balancing it against the facilities that we have, the money we have, the skill set, the research community we have and have a pretty large spreadsheet [Laughter] and then we formulate a workable plan based on that. And so, we often times there's some back and forth because we might have to make some compromises to the ideal science strategy because of schedule pressures. Another schedule pressure we have to honor, of course is to deliver on time. So, if something is needed for an Artemis mission, if something is needed for a long duration mission, we have to understand when those due dates are and make sure we build a schedule that meets those due dates. So, it's a real partnership between the science and the management, and that's why we're designed the way we are to kind of work together closely and put together that's scientifically ideal but practical.  Host: Are we looking at certain things for -- are you budgeting certain ideas or efforts or elements towards more questions that we may want to answer on the Moon with the Artemis program because maybe, you know the countermeasures are good for microgravity, sure, but are they good on the Moon? Will they translate nice? Is there that effort already in the human health countermeasures?  Laura Bollweg: Yes, and I'll ask Peter to expand on this, but he's already brought up the radiation, so with the shorter duration missions, of course we lose duration, but we're going to gain some radiation information and we'll have smaller isolated more confined environments. So, we'll be losing some stressors, like duration, but gaining other ones that are important scientifically.  Peter Norsk: Yeah, one big unknown, when you mention the Moon, but you could also mention Mars as the next step, that is to understand the level of gravity on the Moon and the effects on the human physiology. It's just not known. It's virtually impossible to simulate that in a one-G environment on Earth. So, the ideal thing would be to have a huge centrifuge in space being rotated at several, you know like the Moon-like g, or the Martian g, that would be perfect for testing that without going there actually, but it can't be done for technical reasons, so we don't know that. And therefore, we need to do a lot of testing on the lunar surface when that becomes possible as a lunar base ever to do this and I guess there will be in the mid '20s to the end of the '20s. And we will do testing to see if 1/6th G, which is very low by the way, protects somehow against the negative effects of a low gravity environment. So, we don't know that. And we don't know what the thresholds are for those protections, and we don't know how the Martian gs will work. That's open 38 percent of Earth gravity, a little more than one-third. So, we don't know that. And my guess would be that the Moon is very much like weightlessness and there's actually some protection on Mars that is good because it will then decrease our resources for mitigating some of the negative effects and that makes it more possible to stay for a long time. I think that's a perception of what we don't know. It's purely a guess. And I can tell you every time I guess I'm incorrect. [Laughter] So, we need to do the testing.  Host: Yeah, this is where the good research comes into play. I think one thing that I took away from that, which I find interesting is you know, you talk about microgravity and you talked about the, for example, exercise as being implemented as a countermeasure right now in microgravity. Sure, you know, exercise is probably important, you said you're guessing, is probably important on the Moon but I think the word \"threshold\" came up to my mind because maybe it's not quite the same.  Peter Norsk: Exactly.  Host: You know, because it's a lot of time dedication. That much exercise. So, at what point are you mitigating the effects, but still being efficient in the way that you're doing it?  Peter Norsk: Exactly. And that's one of the questions we are asking. So, it's an excellent question. We can't answer it right now. We need to do some of the testing. We can simulate it during parabolic flight where you can find different trajectories and you can do it at these levels, but it's only for 20 seconds and it's proceeded by high G levels that disturbs what you are observing in the low G levels. But you can do something. You can simulate in the water with certain kind of loading. You can de-load people by using a hoist, called [Active Response Gravity Offload System], ARGOS by the way. ARGOS, yes. And but it's not optimal because you do not have the fluid shifts and if you do it on the water you have the fluid shift but then you have the resistance of the water. So, I mean, it's not the same thing. So, we need to do testing on the Moon and that's hopefully what will happen in the '20s.  Host: It's a very exciting time. Laura and Peter.

                        "description": "Gary Jordan (Host): Houston, we have a podcast. Welcome to the official podcast of the NASA Johnson Space Center, Episode 129, “Art and Spaceflight.” I'm Gary Jordan, I'll be your host today. On this podcast we bring in the experts, scientists, engineers, astronauts, all to let you know what's going on in the world of human spaceflight. We're lucky enough to talk to a number of astronauts on this podcast. Some of them are experienced astronauts, with one or more flights under their belt. Others about to embark on the journey for the first time. Nicole Stott is one of those experienced astronauts. She retired back in 2015 after completing a long duration stay on the station for Expedition 20 and 21 in 2009, along with a spacewalk. And a space shuttle mission STS-133 in 2011. And this comes after an extensive career at NASA, working across multiple centers, in multiple disciplines. After retiring, Stott turned her attention to paintings and art as a way to communicate the feelings and emotions she experienced on orbit and as a way for kids to engage in human spaceflight. So, here we go. A fascinating conversation with Nicole Stott about her spaceflight experience and the importance of art as a form of expression and as a form of inspiration. Enjoy.  [ Music ]  Host: Nicole, thanks so much for coming on the podcast today.  Nicole Stott: Nice to be here, thanks.  Host: Really appreciate your time. You're here to record one of our video series called “Down to Earth,” right?  Nicole Stott: I am and for my flight medical. [laughter]  Host: Oh, of course.  Nicole Stott: Every year.  Host: So, flight medical that means -- you know after retiring as an astronaut you still have to come back every once in a while, for medical reasons?  Nicole Stott: Yeah, they try to keep track of us so.  Host: OK.  Nicole Stott: They'll get us back here once a year and they do pretty much the same test they would do on you if you were still here as an active astronaut.  Host: So, I guess biological, just making sure you're healthy, almost like a physical or is it deeper than that?  Nicole Stott: It's a lot like a physical, it's like a really good physical. And then like this time for instance I'll be doing a [Dual energy X-ray absorptiometry] DEXA scan to look at my bone density, and some ultra sounds, and you know things like that where they're doing, they have this thing called a longitudinal study, I can never say it. Where they want to look over time at how, you know how your body is changing since flying in space. And if they can do that with as many as astronauts as possible, they might actually be able to figure something out. Yeah.  Host: Data is good.  Nicole Stott: It is good, yeah.  Host: Talking to a lot of, lot of scientists so. Having that sort of long-term data even after spaceflight. Because you've had a long duration spaceflight and you've had a short duration spaceflight so.  Nicole Stott: Yep.  Host: So, having that data will be nice. Well, today since you're here I really wanted to go through your story if that's OK.  Nicole Stott: OK.  Host: From, from your childhood all the way through what you're doing now.  Nicole Stott: I'm old, I'll have to remember it all. Yeah. [Laughter]  Host: Well it says you were born in New York, but I guess Clearwater, Florida is more like home.  Nicole Stott: Yeah, my parents, I was born in Albany, New York, but they moved to Florida when, I don't even think I was a year old, so. I don't think I can respectfully claim Albany as a hometown, you know? And yeah, I grew up in Clearwater and now we're back just down the road in St. Petersburg after 20 years in Houston, yeah.  Host: Alright, so you like Florida then?  Nicole Stott: I love Florida, yes.  Host: Yeah, yeah, I have family there too, so we visit, we're actually going up for Christmas.  Nicole Stott: Ooh very good.  Host: Should be nice, not your white Christmas, but I don't know, a beach Christmas is not too bad.  Nicole Stott: It isn't.  Host: Alright so, so what's interesting is you, from childhood it seems like going, I guess I'm going to skip ahead to your college education. Because you are, went for aeronautical engineering at Embry-Riddle, Florida.  Nicole Stott: Uh-hum.  Host: So, did you always know that you wanted to go into engineering, did you have some sort of maybe spark of inspiration that led you in that direction?  Nicole Stott: Well, I grew up, I mean my parents very thankfully we tried to do this with our son too, just shared what they loved with us. And my mom a very creative person, you know if I was going to get to ballet lesson it was because my mom was going to get me there. And my dad built and flew small airplanes. And so, as a family we hung out at the local airport pretty much every weekend. And that's where I think I developed a love for flying. I knew I wanted to do something that had to do with flying at the time. I knew I wanted a pilot’s license, but I didn't think I wanted to be a pilot for a job, you know. And so, I really got to the point where I was like, wow I'd like to know how things fly. And that's what took me down the engineering path, but I'll tell you when I was getting ready to graduate from high school. I didn't even, I didn't know what engineering was.  Host: Oh really?  Nicole Stott: I really didn't. I honestly didn't even really know if I for sure was going to go to college. And I saw most of the people that I was, that I was hanging at, that were my best friends in school, they were going off to college and so I decided to do the same thing. Sadly, my dad had been killed in a small airplane crash when I was 16. So, you know having kind of this, you know like path of, OK you're going to graduate from high school, you're going to go to college. I don't know I wasn't really thinking about it that way. But, figured out, want to know how things fly, talked to somebody who told me about aeronautical engineering, thankfully they didn't tell me how difficult aeronautical engineering was, because I don't know at that point, you know, if I was even trying to think about going to college would I have chosen that. And it was the best thing, I mean it ended up being the best thing because I think, you know if you want to know how airplanes fly, why in the world would you not want to know how rocket ships fly. And Embry-Riddle was right down the road, I mean right down the street from, or up the street from Kennedy Space Center.  Host: Did you have some time in planes even through middle school, maybe high school, just flying maybe small aircraft or really, I mean you were just interested in it?  Nicole Stott: No, no, no like, you know with my dad, like I said we were out at the airport and if he was building an airplane, he built two small, you know that you actually fly in, like aerobatic airplanes, he built two biplanes. One was a Starduster Too and one was a Skybolt. And so, as a kid I was strapped into the front cockpit of those things and going out and flying with him all the time. And there were other people at the airpark that I would go flying with. And so, it was just part of this normal thing that I did as a kid. And when I graduated from high school, I didn't go straight to Embry-Riddle, I stayed local and I went to the local community college or at the time it was St. Petersburg Junior College. And that's now St. Pete College and they had this really great program called Aviation Administration. Which was kind of a, I know it was kind of an aviation business program, but you could earn your private pilot’s license as part of the program out at St. Pete Clearwater Airport. So, I'm like, oh this is awesome, you know I'll go there.  Host: That was the draw.  Nicole Stott: Yeah, I can work on my pilot’s license, get that while I'm at this school, it was local, I didn't have to move away at the time and I could do all the, you know the little, the basic courses that you have to do regardless of what degree program you're going for. You know I could do that while I was there and then transfer over to Embry-Riddle.  Host: Did you, it seems like you were definitely into planes, but I heard a little bit about rockets too, you said how rockets fly, was there interest early on or maybe that sparked a little bit later?  Nicole Stott: There absolutely was, I mean I know you're looking at me across this table thinking there's no way she could possibly be old enough to have watched that first Moon landing, yeah, but laugh. [Laughter]  Host: We're getting it all out.  Nicole Stott: No, silly thought. And laughing is good. It's real and so I watched that with my family, I mean I have vivid memory of sitting in front of the black and white TV with a grilled cheese sandwich for some reason and watching people on the Moon. I mean it was incredible and then we would go outside and look at the Moon and talk about it and stuff. But, I'll tell you it was a real long time before I thought that this idea of astronaut could be real or pursuing anything really to do with rockets could be real. And because it seemed like, especially with the astronaut job, that oh that's something other special people get to do. You know, why should I think that that's anything they would pick me to do. And, yeah thankful ultimately the mentors that encouraged me.  Host: Yeah, cause you eventually, I mean you didn't go to NASA first to be an astronaut. You ended up at NASA through some other, some other avenues. I think you were in the private industry for a little bit.  Nicole Stott: Yeah.  Host: Before going to NASA.  Nicole Stott: Yeah and I was in the private, it ended up being a great job for about a year and a half worked right out of college at Pratt and Whitney down in West Palm Beach. And they were doing really cool designs on advanced engines and, you know I mean it was really super top secret, you're off in this like bunker office that has three level, I mean you don't know if it's day or night when you leave and stuff. And it was really interesting to see that side of engineering. Because for me what it made me realize is, I didn't want to do that side of engineering, it was interesting, I mean that was what you would consider very, like hardcore engineering was being done. And I always knew I was a hands-on person. And I discovered it more while I was there, I'm very thankful for the people that like that kind of work. And want to design really cool things that way. But I got that job, I had applied to NASA at Kennedy Space Center for one of their shuttle operations jobs. And at the time they weren't hiring. And so, I took the job at Pratt and Whitney, really, I mean I enjoyed the time there and learned a lot. And while I was there I got a call from the folks at Kennedy Space Center. And they were -- putting together a whole new kind of pool of young engineers, we were, it was just after return to flight, after Challenger. And it was awesome, it was like this group of young engineers coming in from all over the country and they were plopping us into the orbiter processing facility and the launch control center, and all of the active operational places where you would have like physically be able to go touch the space shuttle.  Host: Oh wow.  Nicole Stott: And to me there was, I mean there was like nothing better than that.  Host: Yeah. Now, well what surprised me is you, you said you applied but they weren't hiring at the time, that means I guess during your time in college, even before you got to Pratt and Whitney, deal outside of college. You were interested in working for Kennedy even?  Nicole Stott: Oh yeah.  Host: Yeah.  Nicole Stott: Yeah, because while, I mean while I was at school and you know I was studying about how airplanes fly and then, you know we had this jet and rocket class and I, I took that and then of course you know the space center is right there. You know, I mean you can't miss it and things are going on there and while I was at school, I mean that's when, you know sadly is when Challenger happened. And but then there was always the buildup, I mean you always knew that NASA was getting things back together, getting, you know ready to start flying again. And that was exciting to me. And I just really wanted to work there. And so thankful that, you know they tracked me down at Pratt and what's cool is, like you know a lot of the work that was going on at Pratt and Whitney was directly associated with the Space Shuttle Program too. You know, I got to do a little bit of work with the guys that did the turbo pumps. And all of the, you know really fast spinning teeny tiny mechanisms that work inside the shuttle to make it fly. And so, maintained a relationship with all of those folks out there while I was working at Kennedy Space Center too. And they were excited to see me, I don't know if they were excited to see me go, we won't say that, but they were excited that I was going to get to go off and do, you know the job that I would really want to do.  Host: Yeah, yeah you already got interest in it.  Nicole Stott: Yeah.  Host: So, what were you doing, I guess when you first started, you said it was in operations.  Nicole Stott: Yeah, I started, there were two main groups in the shuttle program at Kennedy. There was the shuttle operations and shuttle engineering. And I started in shuttle operations and I was an engineer in the orbiter processing facility. Which is kind of, it's like a big garage, it's like a hangar where the orbiter part of the space shuttle would be worked on to get it ready for flight. And had all these big like scaffolding all around it and I mean if you walked into that facility and you didn't know where to look for the space shuttle, or for the orbiter, you wouldn't see it. Somebody would have to point it, OK it's above your head or it's behind that, you know that piece of structure that's wrapped around it.  Host: Wow.  Nicole Stott: I mean it's a really really great facility. And that's where I started, right on that hangar floor and it was, it was a lot like a, I call it more of a project management job really. Because we were responsible for just tracking through and making sure that all the work was done to get the orbiter out of that facility and moved over to the vehicle assembly building, so it could be hooked up with the external tank and the solid rocket boosters, and rolled out to the pad, and you know launch from there. Yeah, it was great. I mean it was great.  Host: Yeah. What, well what was particularly interesting about the orbiter, I mean it captured the hearts and minds of so many people for 30 years that it was flying. It was a beautiful vehicle, but what really struck you about this particular vehicle?  Nicole Stott: Well I think, and it still does now when people ask me, like to reflect on the, kind of the legacy of it, or the significance of it. I look at it like, you know a lot of things, especially from an engineering side, you know a lot of things that are designed where they want it to do five different things and they want to do all five things well. It usually doesn't happen. Usually three, two or three of those things are sacrificed a little and the other things are done OK. But, you know kind of the design by a committee thing. Doesn't usually work that well. The space shuttle I think is just such a beautiful example of how that worked really well. I mean it launches people to space, it took a significant amount of cargo to space, it could be used as a laboratory itself, you could live there, you know in space for quite a while and then we had these tanks you could strap on the back, you know in the payload bay and make it stay up there longer. Could dock to space stations, I mean all of these things that you could do with this vehicle that, you know I think it's going to be a long time before we see a spacecraft like that again. Now there might be reasons why you would separate those things, so you do your people one way, do your cargo one way, all of that. But, you know in hindsight when you look at the space shuttle and you see how just wonderfully it performed all of those things, or supported crews to perform all of those things, I mean it's amazing. And then you've landed on a runway. [Laughter]  Host: Yeah.  Nicole Stott: I mean it was really, you know human, there should be that little wheel stop chirp you know and then the nose wheel down kind of thing. I think that's, yeah, that's a good thing.  Host: So, when did you start switching your thought process to this is interesting, I want to understand how these things fly, I want to work on the orbiter too, I want to fly in the orbiter.  Nicole Stott: Yeah, I'm actually a little slow I guess, because I worked at Kennedy for almost ten years. And it was probably eight years into that when I started thinking, hey you know what about this astronaut thing. And that happened I think primarily because I had, working there I had the chance to work in so many different places that were part of getting the space shuttle ready to fly. And I think about some of my friends who had engineering jobs where, like every three or four years they would move to a whole new company, so they could get experience doing something else. And I had that right at Kennedy Space Center. So, I moved out of doing the job on the orbiter processing facility, to being a project engineer on one of the vehicles for a while, to being in the launch control center, to doing the convoy commander job on the runway with all the vehicles, you know getting the crew out and the vehicle back to the hangar again. So, I got to see this, just almost end to end of the process. And involved with that seeing the astronauts come through and learning more about what they do and the kind of people they are, and their backgrounds. And I realized you know it’s like, 99.9 percent of an astronaut’s job is not flying in space. Sadly, you know.  Host: Yeah.  Nicole Stott: And at least 80 percent of it, and that's probably low was a lot like what I was doing already as a NASA engineer. And so that just got me thinking, oh, you know so maybe the background, the experience I have would, you know meet the requirements. And I still don't think I would've ever picked up the pen, because you had to do that back then, it wasn't electronic and to pick up a pen. And fill out the application without the encouragement of a couple people that I consider to be mentors at work. And, and all those people did, I mean all they said to me was, you know they didn't say oh Nicole you'll make the greatest astronaut there ever was, you know kind of thing, they might not think that now. But, they, what they said to me was, pick up the pen and fill out the application. And just hearing somebody else say it encouraged me to do it. And I am so thankful to those people, when I see them I thank them. And I try to encourage others I'm like, you know because we try to think about, you know in a lot of cases we don't have control over a lot of things. There's not a lot of things we can do to make something happen. But, we have absolute total control over filling out the application. And it's amazing how we can just self-sabotage so many times. And young girls especially I think second guess themselves a lot. And I think just that kind of, OK just pick up the pen, it doesn't, you know, doesn't cost you anything, it doesn't hurt you, you know.  Host: Yeah.  Nicole Stott: You have total control over doing that.  Host: So that push was definitely very helpful, what was your pitch when during the interview process? What did you say, this is why I should be an astronaut?  Nicole Stott: I don't know.  Host: Oh really.  Nicole Stott: I don't know, you know I don't, they never really ask you that question directly.  Host: Huh.  Nicole Stott: You know they ask you questions about why you, at least I remember from my interview they ask questions about, you know why you would want to be an astronaut, you know what excites you about it, what, you know inspired you to do it? Maybe, maybe that why do you think you would be good comes through the questions of, you know what your experience is all about and that kind of thing. I think the time I had at Kennedy Space Center was, I mean it was just key to being ready to do this. And you know I didn't get selected, I was really fortunate to get an interview the first time I applied. And I didn't get selected and I remember being, I was still at Kennedy working. And they were having one of the, like a flight readiness review or something for a space shuttle launch and David Leestma was there. He's an astronaut and he was the head of the astronaut office at the time. And I knew him through interactions with the program at Kennedy. And so, when the day came where they were going to be making all the phone calls that you normally get the phone call get told, you know, yes. Cause if you don't get a phone call you're usually getting, you know you get like a little email or something.  Host: Oh.  Nicole Stott: And tell you no. But I was fortunate to be at Kennedy Space Center and Dave was there and he tracked me down and he told me, you know sorry Nicole we're not, you know we're not bringing you on this time. And you know here's me having, like not cry in front of him kind of thing, cause it's a little bit, it's emotional you know. Even if you go into that thinking, OK there's no chance, you know just enjoy the interview process, enjoy meeting all these people. And just know, you know thinking that it's not going to happen. It's kind of like going out for cheerleading, you might think you don't care if you don't get it, but you kind of do. And so, he's telling me, he's like well you know but we would really love it if you could come work for us at Johnson Space Center out at Ellington Field and fly as a flight engineer on the shuttle training aircraft. And I'm like, and he said something like, we'd really like you to get some operations experience. And I remember thinking then, like OK don't say it out loud, but you've been working for ten years in shuttle operations, what does he mean you know? And so, yeah so I ended up taking this job here at Johnson Space Center and out, I mean imagine this, you know you're a person who was inspired by wanting to know how things fly, wanting to fly yourself, and now after having this, you know working hands on, up close and personal with the vehicles themselves, now I'm going to get have an office that's at an airport. And I'm going to get to fly in T-38 jets and I'm going to get to fly in the shuttle training aircraft and we'll maybe get a flight every now and then on the Zero-g airplane, I mean it didn't seem like it could get any better.  Host: Yeah, but that was, I mean you could've stayed there and probably been very happy right, even there it seemed like that was like the dream.  Nicole Stott: Absolutely, I mean I think about it now, I'm like actually every single one of the jobs I had along the way, I would've been happy with for a long time. And I like thinking back now that I didn't really have, I don't know maybe I should admit it, there wasn't like a method to the madness, you know it wasn't like I was working as, you know an engineer in the orbiter processing facility and I was stalking other jobs. And you know around, oh I got to get my GS-14, you know I was never doing that, it was just oh look there's a job over in project engineering doing this thing now, it'll get me exposure to this other aspect of what goes in with getting spacecraft ready to fly, oh let's try for that.  Host: Yeah.   Nicole Stott: And this, I mean it was, I think about it like, it's kind of like being in the astronaut office, or if you're training out at the Neutral Buoyancy Lab. There's people in places where you work, where it's just such a wonderful mix of like professional and personality. You know and when I do my presentations I show this picture of our crew of the Expedition 21 crew. And it's when we had an overlap with crew change over, like three crew members coming up before three went back, so we had nine onboard. And it's when Guy Laliberte was up on station, he was, it's like the owner, founder of Cirque de Soleil and he was a spaceflight participant. And he considers himself a clown, so he brought us all these red clown noses, so we did these goofy crew pictures, you know with the clown noses on. But I show it because, I mean like who were the people you want to work with. I mean you want to work with the people that are going to have your back when it hits the fan, that you know they trust that you'll have theirs. And then you want to work with people that you know you're going to have a good time with too. And that's what I felt every step of the way. And then throw in at Ellington, getting to fly on these really super cool airplanes, modified in ways that you would never want your normal airplane to be modified. And training astronauts to land a space shuttle, I mean I really, I really didn't think it could get any, you know any better than that.  Host: Honestly, yeah, I mean you say maybe there was no method to your madness, but what it sounds like is the method was an opportunity presents itself and you seized it, you went for it. It sounds like that, you know I want to try this, I want to try this. Maybe it was just, it wasn't maybe preplanned, but maybe you had that kind of thought to, I should go do something else, I mean I need to round this out. It's that drive.  Nicole Stott: Yeah, and maybe that was underlying.  Host: Maybe, maybe.  Nicole Stott: Maybe that was underlying it a little bit, because I think honestly what I tried to pay attention to was what I was enjoying, and you know that started with flying I guess. You know I enjoyed flying, I enjoyed learning about flying, I think that introduced me to people and opportunities that maybe wouldn't have otherwise.  Host: Uh-hum.  Nicole Stott: Same thing, you know working at Kennedy where, you know I'm working in the orbiter processing facility, but you're seeing, you're meeting the people that are coming, you know that you're tying into to, OK it's the vehicles moving from this place to the next place. And you're just having that interaction and those opportunities present themselves.  Host: Yeah. Do you remember the call when you finally got it?  Nicole Stott: I do remember the call. I -- that was the same day and so I was living here in Houston now. That was the same day that I was getting ready to go, it was right before I headed out to go do my check ride for my instrument rating for my pilot’s license, my instrument rating out here. And it was Bill Parsons who called me. And I knew Bill from working at Kennedy too. And so, we had a long conversation, and at the end Bill says, oh and you can't tell anybody yet. [Laughter] Can't tell anybody now and I'm like what do you mean Bill, you can't tell anyone? And, yeah, we need to keep it hush-hush because we're going to, you know make the announcement more around like an Apollo anniversary or something. And I'm like OK, can I tell my family at least, yes you can tell your family. And so here I am now having to get in the car and go out to do a check ride with this flight instructor and I've got this grin like from ear to ear on my face and he's, he's like most people come out here and they're a little, you know hesitant, they're a little worried about doing a flight like this and nervous. And I'm like yeah, I'm all those things, but I'm also very excited about something too and I'll tell you like in a couple days or whatever and so. Yeah that was awesome.  Host: Wow, yeah you had to hold it in.  Nicole Stott: Yeah.  Host: Oh my gosh. So, tell me about the training process, you know this is another exposure to more things you said you already had a nice round experience from your working at Kennedy and that was invaluable. But what was it training leading up to that first flight?  Nicole Stott: Well there's a lot of it, I mean it starts out of course being a lot like going back to school. Where, you know they want you to learn all about the systems on the spacecraft you're going to fly. And for me at the time that was going to be shuttle and you know potentially station. And then you know in parallel learning a little bit about the Soyuz rocket because we were, we were partnering with our Russian partners to get, to station and the possibility of flying and if I was going to station that would be a rescue vehicle, so learning all about that. Russian language training, which I will tell you that was the most difficult part of astronaut training for me, was to learn another language.  Host: Hear that a lot.  Nicole Stott: I'll tell you, you know some, I blame my mom cause somehow, I made it all the way through university without ever, not even the first Spanish class.  Host: Wow.  Nicole Stott: Nothing, I don't think that's possible these days, but nothing. And so, when you're 40ish trying to learn your first language, that was, your brain, your brain does not support it. But, it worked out, we have great instructors here. And then, you know things like how to do a spacewalk, and how to fly the robotic arm, and you know how to work in a spaceship, and emergency training. I mean it was all of these things, which, you know the people that train us, the people that you're working with in mission control, or on some of the other programs, I mean you're getting exposure to every aspect of what you know life will be like in space, but also what it takes to make it happen. Which I think is really really important for astronauts to do. To not just be kind of in a bubble of astronauty kind of training.  Host: Yeah.  Nicole Stott: Where that's just what you're doing, but really to be out and be part of the workforce that's making it happen.  Host: Yeah. And you were already a part of it too, that kind of probably helped a little bit because you were coming from a different part of NASA. Yeah.  Nicole Stott: I'll tell you, I felt like, it was kind of like every step of the way with the jobs I had with NASA, I felt like, oh wow how could this be better than what the job I was just doing. Everyone seemed like it had something about it that was just, you know it was growing on the last thing that I had done. And that's the way I kind of looked at the astronaut job too, because in reality there's no guarantee you'll ever fly. I mean things could happen, whatever, there's not really a guarantee when you get selected as an astronaut that you'll fly. So, you know for me I loved the job for that 10 percent of it that's, or that 99 percent whatever that's not flying in space too. And I think that might have been a lot to do with having the NASA engineering job already.   Host: Uh-hum.  Nicole Stott: And then, I don't know, you know I just, you know I just feel so thankful to even have been considered. Because, you know that job for sure out at Ellington, you know at the time I'm thinking, what do you mean operations, I just worked for ten years in shuttle operation, I mean the day I got there I go OK this is what they mean. How do you work as a crew in a complex environment, like a real complex environment, like an airplane that's being used to train astronauts to land space shuttles? And in a T-38 jet and things like that. And so, you know when I got that job that was 1998 and Steve Swanson got selected to be in the, that astronaut class. And he had that job, so I took his seat. And then when I got selected, a young man named Shane Kimbrough came in and took that seat. And so, I try to tell people, you know what, if you interview and you don't get selected and they offer you a job, you take it. Cause they have something they want to see.  Host: Yeah.  Nicole Stott: And they know the place to put you to see it.  Host: Yeah.  Nicole Stott: And so, so you do it.  Host: Yeah. Well let's get to the fun part, [Laughter], you said a lot of the job is not flying in space, let's talk about flying in space. What was it like, that first flight, this was 2009 and your first flight I believe was a long duration mission?  Nicole Stott: It was. My first flight was Expedition 20 was the, and 21, so I overlapped two of the station Expedition missions. I flew to and from that flight on a space shuttle, so up on the space shuttle Discovery with the STS-128 crew. And home with STS-129, which is Atlantis. And I, that was so cool to do that, to be part of, you know really to be like part of these different crews.  Host: Yeah.  Nicole Stott: All for one mission. It's funny when you look at the patches lined up it looks like four different missions and I guess in a way it kind of is, but I'm like no it's like I got there this way, I got home this way and these were all the people I got to work with in between. And the shuttle flight getting there, that's where I got to do the spacewalk that I did, that was with Danny Olivas who was part of the 128 crew. And it was just really cool how that all kind of worked and blended together.  Host: Yeah. I mean you worked so much with the orbiter in Kennedy, now you were there riding it and you got two, right you said went up in Discovery, you went down in Atlantis.  Nicole Stott: Yeah.  Host: You got this wide range of crews, we're talking shuttle expedition, expedition, shuttle, right?  Nicole Stott: Uh-hum.  Host: So, it's just this, it's this gigantic experience and you get it to do it for a long time.  Nicole Stott: Yeah.  Host: So, I mean, what were the expectations going in and then how, what was the reality like?  Nicole Stott: Well I'll just tell you, the expectations were high to begin with.  Host: Yeah.  Nicole Stott: But in, you know in, when I think about it now, I know we're on radio, but you know imagine my hand as like in front of my face here, that was the expectation. And then I can't reach my arm high enough for what it really it was, I mean every aspect of it.  Host: Yeah.  Nicole Stott: It didn't matter and it's kind of like the fortune cookie thing. You know you could just throw in space on the end of it, you know I'm cleaning the toilet in space, [Laughter], you know that's an awesome thing to be able to do. And it was, I mean the overall experience it was just like this, I think about it now, it's like just one big moment wrapped up, you know together.  Host: Yeah.  Nicole Stott: Because people ask, well what was your favorite thing about it? And I, you know certainly you can talk about, you know what it feels like to fly. You know, to float just effortlessly like that, that's amazing. And you know the work we're doing up there, which is all about improving life on Earth. And, I don't know the view out the window you cannot beat that. It leaves an impression on you for the rest of your life. And I think about it now, it's like all these complex things we do, you know we, it takes, it's really technically challenging to get a spacecraft with people on it safely to space. And then to live and work on a space station and get safely home. And all the science that's going on in between. And I came home and maybe I'm just simple, but I came home with really three simple lessons which were like, you know we live on a planet. And then you look out the window and there is no denying, it's like oh my gosh we live on a planet in space together as earthlings, you know we're all earthlings, that's another one. And then that the only boarder that matters is that thin blue line of atmosphere that blankets us all. And it's this reality check that just gets in you, and sticks with you, and just, you know like the who and where we are in space together. And, yeah, wish everybody could do it.  Host: We were, not too long ago we had a podcast episode with Frank White.  Nicole Stott: Uh-hum.  Host: About the overview effect.  Nicole Stott: Yes.  Host: And we got, we got to talking about that.  Nicole Stott: Yeah.  Host: He brought up your name specifically as someone who he believes based on the interview that you had with him, that you were profoundly changed. Based on, even what you're saying right now, you're profoundly changed, your perspective going up in space gave you a different perspective.  Nicole Stott: Absolutely and I think, I can't imagine there's any astronaut who doesn't feel that in some way. Maybe isn't like actively expressing it the same, but, yeah, I believe it happens to everyone. There is, and there's this desire really to share it afterwards. I mean I think we all want to share our spaceflight experience, right? You want, I mean I want the people who don't know there's a space station to know there's a space station. And then that, you know for as long as my 17-year-old sons been alive, there's been people from 15 different countries working together peacefully successfully in space. Doing amazing things to improve life here on Earth. And I think we all find our way to communicate that. And that expression of what the perspective is, was, how it changes you, what influence it has. I think that's part of sharing that experience. And it's something for me that's really, I think profoundly important because I want people in their day to day lives to be reflecting like I do now on the fact that, oh my gosh I live on a planet. I'm an earthling. You know, all this border stuff we're talking about, here's the one that matters. You know that we share, that we need to be, you know managing. [Laughter]  Host: It is, it does go deep, you know the phrase is simple, we live on a planet, but I can absolutely imagine, it is, it's, we were talking about as something so finite, whether you're talking about something more unified than maybe we are making it out to be culturally. So, it's just, that maybe the view gave you some perspective, maybe you talked about what we're doing is important to you. You think that space exploration is important maybe for that reason, maybe for others there's a bunch of other things we can talk about.  Nicole Stott: Yeah.  Host: We talk about them a lot on this podcast for sure, but, yeah wanting to share that, I can see why that would be a drive for you.  Nicole Stott: Yeah, it really is. And, you know I wouldn't extract myself onto seven million pounds of exploding, you know rocket fuel below me. You know with a seven-year-old son at home if I didn't think, if I didn't honestly believe that what we're doing there is important.   Host: Uh-hum.  Nicole Stott: And we need to, we need to figure out more and more creative ways, which is what I love why you guys are doing this. You know, to share that experience. And, you know those three things about planet, earthling, thin blue line, I mean those are facts that we all know. We all learn, I know kindergarten maybe that we learn about planets first and that we happen to be on one. And, but I think we don't tend to think about it in our day to day lives all that much. And I think if we did, it's one of those things that can bring this whole perspective shift back to Earth too. Where you don't have to go to space to know these things. You can look up at the stars at night and feel the same way about kind of our place in the universe and be humbled by it. And in awe and wonder and all of those things.  Host: Yeah. Did, you know this thought process that you're explaining now is, did that happen on your first spaceflight, maybe your second, maybe it, maybe you have the two spaceflights, came home, sat on it for a little bit and then it hit you. Do you remember when?  Nicole Stott: I think, absolutely during the first one.  Host: OK.  Nicole Stott: And then I think it's one of those things that's a little bit overwhelming and, so there's a struggle to really kind of communicate it and I probably still don't even communicate it very effectively, but to find ways to make it relatable. And that's why I think coming back to facts we all know is a nice way to do that. You know to kind of say, hey we live on a planet, yeah and well no duh, you know yeah, we live on a planet, OK hey we live on a planet in space together. You know there's nothing better to think about what's, you know hey your local is global. You know your neighborhood is a planet.  Host: Yeah.  Nicole Stott: And if, just the inter-connectivity of it, the you know nothing that happens on this side of the planet doesn't affect the people on the other side, or other life on it that we share it with. I mean that's a huge thing to bring in to like your reality.  Host: Right.  Nicole Stott: And be thinking about regularly.  Host: So, not to jump ahead from some of other things you've accomplished, but this is I think the nice transition. You're talking about wanting to express that, how do I, how do I tell this message and even now you're saying, maybe I don't have the right words.  Nicole Stott: Yeah.  Host: But I know you're very into art. I know this is a way for you to express this maybe exactly what you're feeling. You have to find an outlet somehow. Maybe it's not speeches, maybe it's not hour-long podcasts, maybe it's something visual. So, what do you try to put, what kind of art do you do and what do you try to put into it to say some sort of message?  Nicole Stott: Well I, most of my art that I do personally is, at this point it's based on images that I took from space.  Host: Oh.  Nicole Stott: And Earth observations, some space crafty things too, but, and that all started really with, I had the chance to paint while I was in space, so I did a watercolor painting on my first flight. Just brought up this watercolor kit, because I thought it would be fun and be something to do that I like doing down on Earth. And when I was thinking about retiring from NASA, which in, from the astronaut it was very difficult decision to consider.  Host: Uh-hum.    Nicole Stott: And in that once I came with the warm fuzzy of, you know yes there are other things I want to do too. I kept coming back to that painting in space. And thinking, OK how do I uniquely share this experience? And that painting was the, kind of the key to me, I knew I was going to paint myself afterwards, but if I could paint and then engage with audiences that don't maybe think about what we're doing in space. You know and at that point really with the motivation of getting people to know what we're doing together in space. And about how it's all about improving life on Earth. And there is this space station, you know that art would be a way to do that, to reach audiences that might not know. But then I can tell you, they're the ones that are then, they got the apps spot station, ISS tracker on their phone. And whether they liked my art or not, you know they want to know.  Host: Yeah.  Nicole Stott: That they'll be able to see this thing now, coming over their head and watch it and know there's six people onboard there.  Host: Uh-hum.  Nicole Stott: So, I think that's a really powerful thing. I think it's why stuff like this, podcasts and other kind of creative outlets are really important for us sharing what's going on up there.  Host: Uh-hum.  Nicole Stott: But then it became something that I now like really consider my mission in life, like I discovered, rediscovered the next mission, which fortunately allows me to tie my love for space exploration and art together. And, you know and that's been with what we started out calling the space suit art project. Which started here in Houston in one hospital and has grown to working with kids in over 45 countries now. And painting, just little paintings that these kids do and then our spacesuit company ILC Dover has volunteered and they sow these suits together into art space suits. And thankful to the ISS program office too for allowing some of their discretionary cargo to be used for a couple of them that have made it to the station and back.  Host: Wow.  Nicole Stott: And had exchanges with the kids that worked on them and, you know, and these are children that are in, you know pediatric cancer centers, refugee centers. You know really in places where you hope and pray it's the worst thing they'll ever go through in their entire lives. And you come in with the inspiration of spaceflight and then you throw a little art in the mix. And, you know these kids are sitting up straighter, they're talking to you about their futures, it's like they're transcending that experience, it's not like they're being distracted, I mean they really in a very healthful way are kind of getting lifted up out of there for a little while.   Host: Yeah.  Nicole Stott: And, you know and then to see their art become part of something that's bigger, that's part of something that other kids who might be going through a similar challenge as they are. It's really powerful. And to see anything in space is really too you know.  Host: Yeah. We talk about if you're trying to engage kids, even we have programs here at NASA, a lot of them are more technical focused.  Nicole Stott: Uh-hum.  Host: You're doing these education challenges, you're building rovers and solving these puzzles. And there is a need for that definitely.  Nicole Stott: Absolutely.  Host: But, where do you think, what kinds of gaps do you think art fills, you know we have all these different avenues to have these [Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math] STEM outreach thing, we talk about [Science, Technology, Engineering, Art, and Math] STEAM sometimes and adding in that art element, what do you think that adds to the perspective and maybe loops in people that otherwise wouldn't be looped in?   Nicole Stott: Well, I think what it, I do think it becomes a little bit more of an inclusive kind of activity, but I think it allows whoever is participating to use their whole brain. You know, and I mean I think about it with my son in school and I've watched it. Especially with the stem movement, which I'm a total supporter of, but not at the expense of like arts and humanities and things.  Host: Sure.  Nicole Stott: But you'll see kids get kind of funneled one way, because oh this boys good at math, or this girl is good at science and then they just, they want to funnel them as one way, when it's like, hey we need our kids to be problem solvers. And this creative element is really part of problem solving. And so even in these robotic competitions what I like, even if they're just labeling it as a stem activity, for the most part I've seen they have to come up with their mission patch. Or they have to kind of creatively describe what their robot is going to do, or they maybe paint on it or draw, you know something. And so, I think there is, this element that way. But I think art is just this way to communicate complex things that we might not be able to otherwise. We do it, it's embedded in science everywhere, I mean look at those beautiful Hubble images that come back. I mean, I'm guessing if you flew out and looked at that nebula, it doesn't necessarily look like that to our naked eye. But, the scientists need to learn and see something about it, so they color that image for what UV is there. Or, and then it's presented in this beautiful way that their brains understand too.  Host: Yeah.  Nicole Stott: You know the ones and zeroes can only go so far with us, I mean you have to have it presented in a way that makes sense to us and, the artistic creative seems to do that a little bit better.  Host: That's right, yeah. I like that idea of engaging a brain, maybe you were talking about besides the rover competition, besides this adding this artistic element, maybe it's visual, maybe it's otherwise. It seemed like there were elements of self-expression in there. Being able to put yourself into some mission, it seems like there was elements of unification there. Where the team is coming up with something together. Creating, you know, you put your idea down on this patch, but someone else puts their idea and now you're, now you're a team. There's this, there's certain elements there that maybe the rover challenge by itself will fill in the gaps using your whole brain, you're putting in the other elements, that's very important.  Nicole Stott: Yeah, I think that's true, I mean we do it here, we do it with our mission crews here.  Host: Yeah.  Nicole Stott: You know we design patches, we lay out, you know how we're going to run, like personally within our mission run it. Pretty much everything we're doing is about teamwork, so you know that's important. And I think, you know you talk about the self-expression, the fact that, you know on the one hand you're like, oh I'm sorry you have to do that. But on the other hand, it's like so good for them. You know the kids when they're doing these projects and they always have to present it. You know they always have to present it. And to be able to present something technical like a robot, a rover, a science experiment, whatever it is. To an audience that might be your parents, or teachers from other schools, or the local community. They have to think creatively about how they're going to do that too, they just can't put up the drawing of their rover and say, here's what it does. They have to, you know creatively communicate it, which is really fun to see too how they do that.  Host: Yeah. It seems like, creativity is the word that I'm hearing a lot when it comes to, you know if we're thinking about artistic expression maybe filling in that creativity.  Nicole Stott: Yeah.  Host: But, I mean I know creativity is part of, you said problem solving. And I think that's a big one, you know we even see it even today, I think one of my, one of the stories I like to tell is. I, so I do commentary in mission control.  Nicole Stott: OK, yep.  Host: I did one for, for a spacewalk where during the spacewalk they inadvertently lost a blanket.  Nicole Stott: Uh-hum.  Host: But they needed to cover something up. So, everybody came together, they had another blanket that they took off of the same spacewalk and they create, like a team on the ground came together and said, how can this blanket fit in this space, that it wasn't supposed to?  Nicole Stott: Right.  Host: And so, they had to open up their entire brain and think, how can we do this, because it wasn't meant to do that, and they had to come up with all the procedures on the fly. And I just think that is, that's one of the most brilliant things that I think has happened, definitely in my career for seeing what NASA engineers are capable of.  Nicole Stott: Yeah. It's, I mean it's all around us here there's no doubt. And then, you know on the space station, just going to that other end of like art, and music, and creativity. I mean for the very first days of spaceflight, art has been there. You know like say Alexei Leonov with his colored pencils doing orbital sunrises and, you know and every single astronaut whether they were photographer or not, before they flew they become one.  Host: Yeah.   Nicole Stott: And musical instruments, you know I think on station now what there's a keyboard, there's at least one guitar, there's a flute, you know Kjell Lindgren brought up what he brought up as bagpipes with him. You know you got to love your crew mate if they're going to let them play bagpipes on the station. And, you know Karen Nyberg, oh my gosh Karen, the most talented artist I've ever met in my life and that's everything. You know drawing, painting, musical instruments, her dad is a really wonderful artist too. And her mom taught her to sew when she was really young and she did quilt squares on station. And sewed a little stuffed dinosaur for her son out of scrap, you know trash material that was up there. I mean I think it's really about, you know we are --talking about human spaceflight. And these are human things to be doing. I mean it's part of who we are and if we're going to be living there, you're not just going to be doing the technical work, you're, you have to have an outlet yourself for, you know the way you're going to remember the experience and how you're going to share it with others.  Host: So, what do you think is the right balance then? There's a lot of technical work, there's a lot of studying, a lot of different things that you as an astronaut have to memorize and know and be aware of. And there's a certain way of thinking, so how do you balance this technical, this logical way of thinking with the creative? And that form of self-expression, where's the balance there?  Nicole Stott: Well you know I don't know if this is answer you're looking for, but I mean had the opportunity to sit on the other side of table when it comes to selecting astronauts before retiring. And I think, you know I think when a person gets to that point where they're coming for an interview. You already know that they satisfied the educational requirements to be there, their jobs, you know did what they needed to do for them to be qualified to be there. But what you're looking for is, OK who is this person? What, you know what do they enjoy doing? How do they apply what they've learned in school and how they work to real life? I mean what is there, who are they as a whole person too? And so, you want to know about their rock climbing, or their art that they do, or the volunteer work they do at Habitat for Humanity, I mean whatever it is there's some aspect of that human being that is outside of the technical school they did and the technical job that they had. Because at this point we're just not, we don't have enough flights, we don't have enough spacecraft to, you know open up the pool of who we interview. I mean that's going to happen. I think we've already, we just, we keep expanding that. And you know at this point we've got to find those things in the people that we're hiring to be astronauts. And I think they're out there, I mean I don't doubt that every astronaut in some way is, has this creative, they might not say it that way, but they're doing something that is not what you would normally think of as technical.  Host: Huh. Well at the time of that we're going to release this recording, some of the astronaut candidates will have graduated to be astronauts.  Nicole Stott: Yes.  Host: And they're going to start looking ahead towards flying here soon. What advice do you have for them as they start getting ready for some of their first flights?  Nicole Stott: Well it certainly have to keep up with whatever training they have you going through. And take advantage of it. You know they'll be opportunities where an extra sim comes up and you could get in it. And see, oh what's the day in a life of, like on whatever spacecraft they might be flying on, it's going to be like, and the opportunity to work with different people. I mean really take advantage of the opportunity to work with different people. Get to know your ground team. I mean absolutely know the people that are going to be mission control for you, know and remember the people that trained you, I mean really that helps prepare you to get to the point of being assignable. And you know pay attention to, I think about this like from a family standpoint. One of the things that my husband and I tried to do, cause our son was so young when I flew the first time, is we wanted him to feel like he was part of the crew. So, whenever I can get him out to a training event, or to meet the people I was flying with, or any of that I would do that. And that gives them a connection to the experience you're going to have when you're, when you're away in space. And, so to not forget that those kinds of things are important as well. And those, I think all of those things really are kind of the human side of it is, and that makes me think back to that paint kit that I took to space. I mean I was so focused on my first flight to making sure my checklists were together. And that I knew what my tasks were going to be, and I had all the information to do that. I mean I am so thankful to Mary Jane Anderson who was my flight crew equipment support person. Who said, hey Nicole you know, you're going to be living up there. You know think about what you'll do in that spare time, which won't be a lot. You know you're busy, but there will be spare time, you're living there, is there stuff that you might be able to take with you that you could use up there? And I would tell people to consider that, you know consider that you'll be living there too, and you want to appreciate that time as well.   Host: Wonderful. Nicole this was a fascinating conversation, I really appreciate your time for coming on the podcast.  Nicole Stott: For me too, thank you so much.

                        "description": "Gary Jordan (Host): Houston, We Have a Podcast. Welcome to the official podcast of the NASA Johnson Space Center, Episode 130, “Mission Patches.” I'm Gary Jordan, and I'll be your host today. On this podcast, we bring in the experts, scientists, engineers, astronauts, all to let you know what's going on in the world of human spaceflight. You don't have to know a lot about human spaceflight to know that there are a lot of patches. In fact, you see it a lot as a fashion icon nowadays. Many recognize the famous Apollo 11 patch. Most around the world recognizes our logo, or what we call the meatball around NASA, the blue circle with the red vector. But, for those that work at NASA, these mission patches can signify a lot more. It can be a symbol that represents a team, an idea, or a reminder of values embedded in NASA culture. And, this has been rooted within the culture since NASA's beginning. Coming on the podcast today to tell us about the significance, the history, and the design of these mission patches is Sean Collins. He's a lead graphic designer here at NASA, and he's been designing these patches for nearly 30 years now. So, here we go. Everything that goes into the iconic NASA mission patches with Sean Collins. Enjoy.  [ Music ]  Host: Sean Collins. Thank you so much for coming on the podcast today.  Sean Collins: Thank you for having me.  Host: This is a very interesting topic. It strays a little bit from what we talk about. We're very technical when it comes to engineering and science, and we talk a lot about spaceflight. This is very much a part of the culture, but this is a different topic because we're dealing with patches which sounds, I guess, I'm saying it's different, but really, it's so much a part of NASA culture and history. I'm really excited to talk to you about it. You've been doing this for quite some time.  Sean Collins: Yeah.  Host: How long?  Sean Collins: My whole career.  Host: Oh, wow. Alright, so.  Sean Collins: About 34 years.  Host: So, tell me about your background. How'd you get up to the point where you came to NASA and started doing this?  Sean Collins: I went to Southwest Texas which is now Texas State.  Host: OK.  Sean Collins: For just a semester and a half, and then I found a school down here in Houston, Tex Academy Art, an 18-month course. The first place I applied was OmniPlan which had just taken over from Kentron. And, I got the job, and been here, and every five years, we change contracts. So, I work only for NASA, but it's a NASA contractor. Every five years, minority owned contracting.  Host: Got it. So, when you first came here, what was going on in the world of human spaceflight? What were some of the first missions that they put you on?  Sean Collins: Russ Byther was working on STS-8 when I started.  Host: Alright. Early shuttle.  Sean Collins: Yeah.  Host: OK. So, you, I guess, started. You weren't designing patches right off the bat, but you eventually got to that point where you were thinking about, where you were assigned to design the patches for some of these early shuttle flights.  Sean Collins: Oh, yeah. I just started off as an associate.  Host: OK.  Sean Collins: I worked my way up into the design department and started doing patches, full airbrush patches, you know, about 30 inches around. And, space station paintings even back then. We did enough to stack them up to the station.  Host: [laughter] Alright. Well, let's set some background here. So, for our listeners, what we're talking about patches, it's, you know, let's start there. What's a patch?  Sean Collins: Yeah. Crew patch is just the, you know, to determine the mission and it has an icon to go to when people, you know, see the patch. They go, oh, that was 51-L, that was STS-7, whatever. As, sometimes has their names on it. Most of the time has all the crew name on it, but there's been a few that they haven't put names on.  Host: Yeah. So, one of the ones that I think people think of a lot when they first think of NASA, they're probably going to think of that blue logo with the red vector that says NASA right across it. So, what's that one?  Sean Collins: The NASA meatball, we call it. It's the NASA insignia. It's a federally protected logo, and it's got all kind of rules on the PMS colors, the pantone matching system. It's 286 blue, 185 red, and white. You know, so.  Host: Been working with that one for a long time, I'm guessing.  Sean Collins: Yeah.  Host: So, what's the significance of that federally protected logo?  Sean Collins: Well, it's the branding of NASA, so, you know, people weren't using it. But, we see it a lot of times. People take it and make it into other things.  Host: Yeah.  Sean Collins: But, it's not supposed to be. We have to follow the rules when we're doing the logos for the astronauts.  Host: So, what are the rules?  Sean Collins: Don't use any parts of the NASA meatball unless it's approved by headquarters.  Host: Because you design some of the patches for the missions that are going to space station to shuttle, so you can't take that vector, you can't take that orbit, you can't take those letters and play with them in the logos.  Sean Collins: Yeah.  Host: OK.  Sean Collins: Unless it's got approval for like return to flight missions they've put it on, and they've put it on, I believe the last one had it, too. Yeah, the last 135 had it on it. It got approved because that was the last shuttle mission.  Host: Significant milestones like that. That makes sense. So, it's a very powerful logo when it comes to NASA, something that we think of as iconic. I know another one, this, and I say this is on t-shirts. But, really, that blue one, the meatball that you're saying, the meatball is on t-shirts, hats, everything you can imagine. Everyone's putting that. It's even a fashion statement now which is pretty funny. But, there's another one called the worm, and it was a red almost a snake-like logo of the outline that spelled out NASA.  Sean Collins: Yeah. That was retired in '92 when I was here. I remember them retiring it and bringing back the NASA meatball. The NASA meatball, I think, was done at around '59, airbrushed, and then I redrew it. Headquarters redrew it, and then I redrew it again in Illustrator.  Host: Oh, OK.  Sean Collins: Actually, it was Canvas Deneba was pre-programmed before Illustrator.  Host: Yeah-- I'm actually very curious to explore some of the technology and how that's progressed over time. I know the worm was a, it was a rebrand initiative, really, when it came to NASA, right? When it first came around. Where, when you first started, were you working on the meatball and then transition to the worm, or were you already?  Sean Collins: Nah. It was on the worm.  Host: It was on the worm already. OK.  Sean Collins: In '83. It was easier to use on print products because you could balance, you know. The NASA meatball has the vector sticking out. It never really can center it right. You got to off center it to get it centered. It's really an eye centering thing.  Host: Yeah.  Sean Collins: And, of course, you can do one color in the worm, black, white, or grey. Actually, four I guess, grey and then the red. So, and it was, I guess, cheaper to produce printing. So.  Host: So, a rebrand, and for a graphic designer, it was a lot more flexibility on your end.  Sean Collins: Yeah.  Host: Because you said there's a lot of rules when it comes to framing and branding, and I know one of the popular things that I see is it is a NASA stylebook.  Sean Collins: Yes.  Host: That tells you exactly how to use the meatball and where to position it. And, it is, from what I've seen, very precise.  Sean Collins: Yeah. Very precise. It even tells you where, how bit the type is, National Aeronautics next to it has to be and where it lines up with the bottom of the NASA and where it goes in the corner of the page and what other logos can go with it. And, they have to be smaller.  Host: So, what's some of the surprising, I guess, restrictions or rules or guidelines that people might not know when they're looking at a NASA product?  Sean Collins: When designing a poster, you have an area at the top that's supposed to be only, you can't have anything any part of your poster in that, or, you know, the background has to be black or white behind the meatball. Where if it's full color, you have to use a black and white. So, it kind of restricts you when you have your poster goes all the way to the top, and then, you check it out. And, they say, \"No, that's in the NASA meatball area.\" So.  Host: Yeah, you got to have this almost blank space, it sounds like.  Sean Collins: Yeah.  Host: OK.  Sean Collins: Usually just fade it into the dark space.  Host: OK.  Sean Collins: Or white, so.  Host: So, that's how you know, really, that it's an official NASA product is when you're following these guidelines because it seems like not everyone seems to follow those guidelines. So, maybe they're not the more, they're just slapping the meatball wherever they want.  Sean Collins: Or, they'll use a 3D meatball from like the internet. You're not supposed to do that for any print products. You'll see it, and they don't hold the shift button when they size it, and you'll get an egg, or you get a squished meatball.  Host: Yeah, a lot of restrictions. It's almost like, I mean, it is a branding exercise. So, when you're working with that you have to follow these restrictions and stay within these guidelines because that is the brand.  Sean Collins: Yeah.  Host: That's what you have to do. So, let's talk about some of the other ones besides the meatball, besides the NASA brands themselves. I'm thinking about iconic patches. So, if people are thinking about patches other than just these logos that we see that are the identifier of NASA, the one, the first one at least, that comes to my mind is the Apollo 11 patch. This is the one I think, I've seen it a bunch of times, and there's a very iconic parts to it. There's an eagle that front and center. You have the Moon right behind that, and then one of the key elements there is there are no names on this patch because this one was famously for all mankind.  Sean Collins: Yeah. And, you know, it has olive leaves bringing peace to the Moon, I guess. And, yeah, and, because everybody at NASA was behind that mission, so they couldn't just put three people. It's kind of, my dad's name is Michael A. Collins, and he worked in Mission Control back then, during Apollo 11, so.  Host: Different Michael Collins.  Sean Collins: Different Michael. He's the Michael Collins. [Laughter]  Sean Collins: So, that was kind of a neat connection with that patch and that mission. But, of course, that was before my time. I was just a kid watching on TV.  Host: Did you learn, were some of those folks that designed some of those patches around when you started?  Sean Collins: Norm Tiller was friends with a guy I work with, Russ Byther, and he did the 13, Apollo 13.  Host: Thirteen, that's another one that didn't have any names on it. What were some key elements of that one?  Sean Collins: The three horses, and Norman Tiller put his initials in one of the elbows of the horse, NT, so.  Host: I'm going to have to go find that, now. That's wonderful. That's 13, Apollo 13. That was the one that didn't make it to the surface of the Moon, wrapped around, and it was one of those iconic missions to return the astronauts safely to Earth. So, definitely an iconic patch that everyone really thinks about when they think about NASA patches. Tell me about the first patch that you worked on and what that was like.  Sean Collins: Well, another iconic one was, of course, 51-L, and any time I tell people I had designed crew patches, it like, oh, did you do 51-L, yeah. But, I did the return to flight.  Host: 51-L is the Challenger accident.  Sean Collins: Challenger accident, yeah. And, that's the interesting thing that we had all men in the design department. That was the first patch designed by a female, a woman, Jennifer Hees. Of course, she worked.  Host: 51-L was?  Sean Collins: Yes. She worked with a crew, you know, put the apple on it. And, but we had a Matro. Back then, we used to airbrush the patches 30 inches. you know, hand drawn everything.  Host: Wow.  Sean Collins: It matched the PMS colors in the paints to pantone matching system. And, had this machine called a Matro machine, and we could burn the text in a circle. So, we didn't, no longer had to write hand cut, draw the letters out in a circle perspective into the middle of the patch. And so, we could do it all on one sheet, and then just rub them down. So, I did the rub down letters on that for Jennifer, I remember. So, that was probably one of the first patches we started doing that on. Maybe one before that. I'm not, you know, it was a long time ago, but.  Host: And, you don't happen to know the name of the mission or the, what, was this for 51-L that you were doing the rub down?  Sean Collins: Yeah. Yeah.  Host: OK.  Sean Collins: And, in fact, when we moved our building from 227, in our file cabinet, I found the original artwork of the 51-L.  Host: Wow.  Sean Collins: So, we still have it over there in building eight. So, it's kind of neat that a lot of the other ones either were given to the crew or given to the History Office. And, this'll probably go to the History Office or the Smithsonian or the 51-L museum, you know.  Host: Wow.  Sean Collins: Where Ochoa has.  Host: That's right. Yeah. Challenger.  Sean Collins: Yeah.  Host: Challenger Center maybe.  Sean Collins: Yeah. Onizuka. I'm sorry.  Host: Oh, yeah. So, this process that you're talking about, you know, I grew up more of a digital age, so this is a little bit before me. So, what was the process of actually working with this large, you said 30 inch -- and you had to airbrush it and everything. What was it like getting from that point to start it to put it onto different products?  Sean Collins: Well, the process you go through with the crew. Back in those days, we'd have five or six crew members giving you input, and I kind of changed that process later down the field. There could be only one, like Highlander.  Host: Oh, yeah.  Sean Collins: You know, Bob says make it green. Bill says make it blue for this. So, I said all the changes come through one astronaut. That's your coordinator. And, we still had, you know, back then, we still had mainly the commander would be the lead on it.  Host: OK.  Sean Collins: But, you'd still get inputs from all of them, and then. But, once we'd narrowed it down, it had to be nailed down before we went to the airbrush board because the hours put into it. And, I mean, some of these patches would take 200 to 300 hours.  Host: Wow.  Sean Collins: Of work, you know. And then, they change a crew, that's--  Host: Throw it out and start over.  Sean Collins: Now, they change the crew, we can, you know, it's on the computer. [Boop sound]. Put the new name in if it fits. You know, unless it's one of those double names. And then, we kind of got to move stuff around. But, yeah, one of the first patches done was I did in a program called Zenographics. I believe it was there it is. STS-28. So, that was in the '90s when we started getting computers. And, this was a real low level, you know, your phone is way better than this computer.  Host: Oh, wow.  Sean Collins: And, you could only get 66 points, then you would run out. Then, you would have to link 66 points to connect, you know, the wing of an eagle or a stripe. You know, so you can have, you know, unlimited points where you can [beeping] all you wanted on a computer. It'd run out after I think it was 66. So--  Host: Wow.  Sean Collins: So, you'd have to patch in little pieces of it.  Host: You have to section, make, do it by sections.  Sean Collins: Yeah.  Host: OK.  Sean Collins: Just the wing would take, you know, four or five sections.  Host: Wow.  Sean Collins: Then, we went to, we hit freehand for a while. It was, these, all the new graphics programs were just coming out. And, Illustrator was out, but Illustrator, you would have to draw it and then wait for it to render. You know, [beeping], and then, you're like, I don't like that color. So, you'd have to change it on the other. So, we went to a program called Canvas Deneba, and I thought it was going to take off. But, then, illustrator became worldwide, and that's what we use on all the patches now. It's like mandatory.  Host: Adobe Illustrator.  Sean Collins: Adobe Illustrator.  Host: OK. So, yeah, that technology has progressed, and it sounds like the time dedication has definitely shrunk from.  Sean Collins: Oh, yeah.  Host: From the time you were doing it with airbrush to the time of these archaic computers to now.  Sean Collins: Yeah.  Host: Yeah, sounds like it's definitely some work. And, I don't know if this is a good thing or a bad thing, but now you can deal with changes as they come down.  Sean Collins: Oh, yeah.  Host: A little bit easier.  Sean Collins: Expedition 57, yeah, got changed a lot of times.  Host: Yeah.  Sean Collins: The names on it. And, 58 back and forth, you know, back all the names. We did a lot of conversions on that.  Host: I guess an important point to mention here is these patches, they're not just something that you come up with and you're like, \"This is what's going to identify your crew now.\" This is something that you're working very closely with the crew members of that mission.  Sean Collins: Yeah.  Host: So, tell me what that's like from the time they start working with you?  Sean Collins: Well, sometimes, they'll come to me and say, you know, \"come up with an idea.\" And, I come up with it, and then, you know, the crew interacts with you. Sometimes, it's from an outside designer. It could be an uncle, a friend, or acquaintance of the astronauts. It could be a family member. STS-76, I had, was it Rich Clifford's nine-year-old son had drawn it in colored pencil. He came into my office. I had a nine-year-old art director. That was kind of cool, and now that kid's grown up, and he's an architect.  Host: Alright!  Sean Collins: So, that was an interesting story on that. We've had, I mean, everyone, it's a team effort. I mean, they'll show people in their office. They'll show their neighbors. They'll show their family, and they'll come up with new ideas and we interact it and see what works. Sometimes, it doesn't work, and we, you know, toss it. Sometimes, the crew patch can have 20 iterations, you know, 20 different patches until we nail one down. And then, we start to tweak that one once we get a real good design down. Some I've done in four hours, you know. So, the simple ones, but we've done other patches that have gone all the way to print and get the AB Emblem does all the sewing since the beginning. I think they were even doing Apollo patches.  Host: Wow.  Sean Collins: So, we work real good with them. They don't really make any money off of it because, they make, except for, \"Hey, we do the NASA patches,\" you know?  Host: Yeah.  Sean Collins: That's why, and they work real well with us. And, but, the decals will go out to, you know, three bids, to Spaceflight Awareness pays for those now, and the decals will be sent out, they could be printed in Illinois or California, Texas, Chicago, wherever. It just, whichever bid they pick.  Host: Yeah. Those folks are through our office.  Sean Collins: Yeah.  Host: I believe the Spaceflight Awareness folks.  Sean Collins: Yeah.  Host: It's a lot of work. Are there guidelines or frameworks when it comes to when you're starting to work on a patch? It has to be these dimensions. It has to be this shape. Are there any restrictions there?  Sean Collins: It has to be around four inches.  Host: OK.  Sean Collins: You know, if they're irregular shaped, you know, it could be maybe 4 and three-fourths tall, but then it can't be, you know, 4 and three-fourth’s wide.  Host: Yeah.  Sean Collins: But, most of them. I mean, they're round or oval-ish shape. Some have some, you know, some of the expeditions got one. They're shaped like a galaxy. And then, that was the outside designer. We do get outside designers who don't follow the, we have an eight color PMS rule, pantone matching system, because that's all you can print in pantone. Even though that's changing with all the digital printing. So, that might be changing pretty soon. We'll be full color photographic patches, the way the printing has progressed, you know. But, you have an eight-armed octopus that prints like t-shirts, you know, that the print. You ever seen a t-shirt printer? It's got the arms [swooshing sound]. That's kind of the basics for doing decals, too. It's screen printing.  Host: I see.  Sean Collins: But, with all digital printing, you know, you can print right on a board now, on a canvas. And so, that'll probably change, but they like to still keep it in eight colors, so it doesn't get all. A lot of the outside designers were too in a paint program, you've got 380 colors, and we have to redraw it, get it down to eight colors, and make it look, you know, block colors. They did a gradient on STS-68, and that cost a lot of money to print it back then, and they said no more gradients. [Laughter] So, gradient was where you, you know, have a light color goes into a dark color.  Host: Right.  Sean Collins: And, it's hard to stitch that. It's hard to print it. It's just costs like four times as much.  Host: Is that the only gradient?  Sean Collins: I believe it was. Oh, we've got tons of outside designs that are.  Host: Sure.  Sean Collins: Come in with gradients and we--  Host: Say no. [Laughter]  Sean Collins: We fix it. We redraw them, so. The other ones, you know, there's some that are kind of. Oh, return to flight 114. That was already done and printed, and then, the accident happened. See, we work on these patches sometimes two years in advance, especially in the earlier missions because the airbrushing and everything.  Host: Right.  Sean Collins: But, after 107, I'm sorry. The accident, they decided to put the outline on the top. Worked with Steve Robinson, and we had just a kind of a vector size ship, just a little arrow tip, you know, non-descript. So, we took the shuttle outline that was used on 107 to commemorate them and put it onto the 114 patch.  Host: And, this is another one of those iconic patches. This is the patch of the Columbia mission, of the Columbia accident. Return to flight is the one after that. They took the outline of that Columbia mission and put it on the top. I see it now. That is wonderful.  Sean Collins: Yeah, and a lot of the patches, if you look at them, they'll have the seven stars, like the Orion configuration. That's usually for the seven.  Host: That were on Columbia.  Sean Collins: And, we've done, you know, seven on one and three on another. We, a lot of things, and if you read the back of the patch on the decal, it'll give you, you know, explanation of the patch. So, that's kind of interesting how things go into it like that. There's a lot of hidden stuff on patches that astronauts have me put in their kid's initials, their, you know, like we were talking about earlier the joke names for the different [Astronaut Candidates] ASCANs that, the astronaut training class, the maggots, the hairballs.  Host: Right.  Sean Collins: There's one in there with a hairball in the helmet. It's a little cat. There's a pig in there for I guess they were called the hogs.  Host: Oh.  Sean Collins: There's one with a chicken bone in it. For, I guess they were called the chicken bones. But, STS-72 probably has the most initials of all the kids. It's got basketballs, chicken bones, hairballs. It's a patch within a patch within a patch within a patch.  Host: Oh, wow.  Sean Collins: And, it was a fun patch to work on.  Host: You got to work on that one?  Sean Collins: Oh, yeah. A lot. And so, the patch, there's an astronaut in the patch, and he as the actual 72 on his patch. If you zoom in on the computer, there's another patch on that guy. You zoom in. I think we took it into six zoom ins where it wouldn't, you know, you couldn't tell what it was anymore. But, there's six patches inside that one patch.  Host: That is crazy.  Sean Collins: If you look at STS-40, it's got the Di Vinci guy, [Vitruvian] Man, I believe. And, the muscles across his stomach say “Sean” in it. [Laughter]  Sean Collins: I got invited to that launch. Worked on that Gutierrez--  Host: So, these are very, these are very personal. These are very meaningful to the crews that are helping design. Because how involved there that you say you have one rep. You say you have one crew member. Everything has to be filtered through them, otherwise it gets crazy and you get pulled in different directions. But, they're, it sounds like they're injecting all of these different elements. Is it as they think of them? Is it all in like one batch and they say, \"Here you go,\"? How does that work?  Sean Collins: Well, they, we started to doing it. I kind of changed that when I became lead. There can be only one, but they still, I've had my whole office full of the whole crew in there, everybody in there. But, you know, you still have the coordinator, and it's usually the commander. And, you get to be good friends with them, too. You know, all these astronauts, you, we hang out, go camping, go to renaissance, and really nice guys and gals. It's been fun over the years. Met a lot of friends that still, you know, they're not flying anymore, but we still hang out. So.  Host: Oh, wow. I didn't realize it was that close of a relationship.  Sean Collins: Oh, yeah.   Host: Yeah, because I guess this is taking some time. You say sometimes some of the early patches were 200 hours' worth of work, but then how much of that is the back and forth communication with the astronauts and working with them? Is it over months? Is it over?  Sean Collins: Oh, yeah. With the early patches, yeah, because we did them so far in advance.  Host: Yeah.  Sean Collins: And, yeah, and you do a lot, and you'll send it. Like, working on the Crew One SpaceX patch right now. It was an outside designer, but I've changed the border. I've changed the words. I've added stuff from the [Mission Operations Directorate] MOD logo. And then, we took that off. And so, it was already done, but it was drawn in a weird program. So, I had to redraw it in Illustrator and fix it, and it just got sent off for approval today. And, just that going back and forth was only like eight hours. You know, but they had worked with the designer before they came to me.  Host: OK.  Sean Collins: But, I don't know. It's funny that you have a job of people like it so much they do it for free. [Laughter] So, the astronauts will get bombarded with designs before we'd even get a work order started. So.  Host: Really?  Sean Collins: So, that's, and then that's why a lot of the times we're going, oh, it's another outside designer.  Host: And, you have to be the one to go in and start tweaking everything so it.  Sean Collins: To make it where you can print it, yeah.  Host: To make it where you can print it. So, I know there's, you know, when you're talking about the designing, different patches and what goes into a NASA patch, you talked about things that are very personal within the patches, something that, you know, the initials of their kids’ names, elements that describe what astronaut class they came from. I know there's elements within patches that have special and significant meaning, whether it comes to spaceflight or other things. I think one of them are the three stripes that lead up. I believe that's something that signifies maybe human spaceflight. Is that right?  Sean Collins: With the, it's the astronaut logo has three stripes with the orbit and the star at the top.  Host: OK.  Sean Collins: So, yeah, that's been incorporated in a few of them, and then, you know, it's been bent and twisted, like, here's one there. And, here, yeah. 123 was the, that's Rick Linnehan's flight. He's a good friend of mine. I've been, done three of his patches, three of his four. And, I've got invited to launches, and we worked on it awhile, and it actually did, I forgot the name of the robot on that patch but had him fighting Godzilla because they went to Japan. And so, they can make t-shirts out of that, too. So, it's fun stuff. There's some that, like, incorporate double patches that have meaning from they were on another mission. So, they'll have a little basic outline of the patch that's kind of incorporated. Sort of like 114, you know, has the outline of the shuttle on it. Lot of stars. Lot of eagles. You know, and some will have, you know, if they had a payload, a special payload in the shuttle or on special payload on station patches, it'll be highlighted on the patch. You know, this part was brought up.  Host: Yeah.  Sean Collins: You know, the station.  Host: So, something significant to the particular mission that they were. And, these missions are, it seems like, you know, it's a mission. This is a shuttle mission and something, you know, a shuttle going up and down doing some task, whether it's a space station assembly or maybe Hubble. Have you worked with some of the expeditions as well?  Sean Collins: Oh, yeah, lots.  Host: Yeah, space station expeditions.  Sean Collins: I've done a lot of those patches, too. And, it's the same thing. You'll have, like, you'll have a station, or you have a highlighted part of the station that's being, you know, gym module or whatever module was brought up. They will highlight that part. And then, some are just, I like the simpler, yeah, I say less is more. And so, the simple ones like 46 kind of looks like a NASCAR patch. Just 46 and the names and the little flags over the Earth. I had an original 46 on there. It was like a stylized in perspective 46. Got patches made, and then somebody said they didn't like it because it looked like another symbol. So, I just did a regular 46. It was like, you know, four and the six combined. And, then it looked like a NASCAR, but it was kind of cool because Mark Kelly had it, and you know, he's gone up so many times. He looks like a NASCAR driver with all the patches. So.  Host: That's right. 46. That was Scott Kelly's one-year mission, right? That was.  Sean Collins: Now, there was a special patch done for that.  Host: Oh, OK OK. Well, yeah. He was - what was he? He went from 46 through 49.  Sean Collins: Five missions probably.  Host: Yeah, I forgot what the numbers were. Man, I should know. I should be able to pull this out, but. Yeah, I'm sure they all blend together after doing it for so long, right?  Sean Collins: Yeah. Yeah, and like, a lot of the patches now for station, they're on three different patches, you know. 57, 58, 59.  Host: Yeah.     Sean Collins: You'll see the same names, and you know, they went up with the 57. They're coming down with 59, but then, when they're on 59, 60's part of their crew, too.  Host: Yeah.  Sean Collins: So, that's why I can't wait until we start launching from here one crew, one mission. [Laughter]   Host: Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Sean Collins: And, that'll be a lot easier on the patches, I think.  Host: That's actually a good question because with commercial crew coming up, they're, for example, SpaceX is going to be launching on a SpaceX Dragon, Crew Dragon, bringing for the, especially for some of the first flights NASA astronauts. I would maybe some international ones. Will you take part in designing some of those patches?  Sean Collins: Yeah, I'm working on one right now, two actually.  Host: Really?  Sean Collins: And, about a year ago, I tried to corner this because I saw it coming. You know, who's doing these patches? Are we doing patches or is SpaceX doing the patches, or are we doing the patches?  Host: It's a good question.  Sean Collins: It's still up in the air, but I'm still, like the Crew One for SpaceX, it's a dragon head in a circle. That's the one I'm working on that was done by an outside designer. But, it was through SpaceX sort of, but now we're fixing it to go to print. But, it's kind of, you know, when, if they would follow the same rules we did. You know, the type has to be at least a quarter inch, three-eighth inch so you can sew it. Anything smaller turns into a little knot, you know.  Host: Oh, yeah.  Sean Collins: So, and we got to fix that a lot. But, it's still my favorite part of my job. I do other things like posters and signs and drawings and everything to do with graphics, but this is my favorite part of the job, doing the logos.  Host: Yeah, the patches. That's really exciting. So, I guess, you know, NASA astronauts are going, are launching from Florida, so naturally, you know, you being able to work so closely with the crew that are going to be launching and designing elements of that. Whether it's a SpaceX or Boeing or whatever, just making something personal for them is pretty meaningful. Yeah. So, tell me about some of the more recent patches that you've worked on using Illustrator and what that's like for, you know, working more digital patches and some of the more recent crews. You talked about expeditions when they're going on long duration stays on the station. They're sometimes going across multiple missions, so having their input in multiple different patches and things like that.  Sean Collins: Yeah. Like Expedition 57. Did a ship on it over the horizon. Did the ship coming at me, then did the ship going away, ship sideways, and we ended up with the ship going away. But, the names were changed. That crew changed a lot, and then we, it had a wave behind the ship, and so, some of the names are too long. So, I had to move that wave. I moved that wave back and forth a few times.  Host: Yeah.  Sean Collins: To make it, you know, curve back in to fix it. So, in Illustrator, it's still kind of complicated to get concentric wave lines, like a zoom going into it. You know, if you move it over to the right, then it doesn't look anymore. So, you have to move the other part of the curve. Then, you get it just right, and then, they add a different name, and then you got to do it again. So.  Host: Wow.  Sean Collins: But, it was real fun working with Alexander Gerst on it. Good guy, and I got to be good friends with him, too, so.  Host: Man, I'm so jealous of how closely you get to work with them and do something so personal for the crew. It's something that they wear constantly up there, and they're proud to show because it's their mission and they wear it on them whenever they're going around to different events. They're in their flight suit with the mission that resembles which one they were on.  Sean Collins: Yeah, and then after their flight, I design their montages.  Host: Oh.  Sean Collins: I basically do 95 percent of those. Basically, all of them now.  Host: And, what are the--  Sean Collins: When they come down, it's like about the eight best photos they had from the mission. In 16 by 20, and there's room for a flag or a patch. Now that they're going up on Soyuz, they don't have enough room for flags. Like, the shuttle, you know, they could bring, you know, 1000 flags, 1000 patches or more, and shuttle they, you know, pound and a half in their leg pocket. So, getting one of those back, and these go to kings, queens, popes. They're going to the Hill this Monday bringing them to Senators and Congressmen. And, that's for the 59 crew. I'm finishing that today. But, a flown patch or a flown flag will go on, and usually the patch is embedded, you know, photographically into the photoshop montage. So, if they don't have a flown one, then they still have their emblem. And, of course, they'll have it, you know, on their uniforms in the photos, too. And so, those are coveted items. When you get presented one of those, you know, with a flown item on it, people love those. And, I love them, too. I get a lot of them. So, after working on a patch for something with the astronauts, you'll get awarded one afterwards. So, it's a little piece of history.  Host: Yeah.  Sean Collins: That flew in space, you know. It's always fun.  Host: That is cool. I know, you're right. They do give them around as little emblems. I know even, yeah, these little things, and you were talking about montage. So, I guess, correct me if I'm wrong, you put the patch on top of the picture, this flown patch. And, the picture is of these best images, and you're able to frame that and keep this memento.  Sean Collins: Yes.  Host: Yeah.  Sean Collins: And, it has a little flown statement. You know, this flew on STS-123, you know and the date. Might have a little inscription about what happened in that mission.  Host: Yeah.  Sean Collins: So.  Host: So, tell me about some of the ways that these patches are used. You've talked about the patches are printed and flown. You've, we've talked about them having to be so, you know, even the print, the words having to be so large so that you can actually sew them, and they act appear. Decals. What are the products whenever you create a design and you approve it. Actually, that's another good question is how do you approve it? But, where does it go, and what other sorts of things are they incorporated in, and what are the restrictions on how they can and cannot be used?  Sean Collins: Yeah, the, another good product that comes out is the lapel pins. Those are, they make those, and they, those get done by Winco I believe, and so they go out and they have thousands of these made. And, those are kind of collector's items. They, you know, print on coffee mugs, hats, t-shirts, even the badge holders, you know, the straps they put on. They put them on little flags, I've seen them. I guess that's about all.  Host: Yeah.  Sean Collins: But, making, you know, mainly the patch. That is Astronaut Office, the sewn, embroidered patch, and then, of course, we have a digital file that the astronauts will use on their presentations for, you know, PowerPoint. They'll put it in there when they're giving a speech when they go to a school or something. It'll be up on the screen. Seen a lot of hats, too.  Host: [laughter] Yeah, I got a beanie from one mission when I was going out to support for Public Affairs. So, I covet that one for sure.  Sean Collins: Koozies, too.  Host: Koozies, yeah, that's a good one.  Sean Collins: From what's that, Expedition 51. Got some koozies made for Peggy Whitson.  Host: Very cool.  Sean Collins: Another good friend.  Host: Alright. I'm starting, I'm more and more jealous every time you name drop there. But, what about the approval process? I did elude to that. So, whenever you're designing something, you're getting all this input from an astronaut, when you can say it's ready to go out the door.  Sean Collins: Well, the coordinator will, of course, approve it. Then, it goes to the Astronaut Office. Then, it goes through their management.  Host: OK.  Sean Collins: And, I believe it goes through headquarters to, like, the astronaut posters we do. Those go through, like, 12 approvals. But, once it gets approved, then we add the thread colors and the PMS color blocks and a little die cut bleed mark on the illustrator file. And, it'll go off to a bidding for the decals. Now, the AB Emblem has the contract, and they've had it forever for the sewn patches.  Host: I see.  Sean Collins: So, they'll go up and make those.  Host: So, now, with some of the more recent missions, using Adobe Illustrator, going the more digital route, what's about the time that you would start working on a patch to the time where it's ready? What's the, what’s the--  Sean Collins: It just depends on the crew, how many iterations they want to make. I mean, it could be done in four hours, and it could be 40 hours. We do have a limit of 45 hours from the Astronaut Office because of funding, so.  Host: OK.  Sean Collins: When we get close to that, we let them know, and then they're like, oh, wrap it up. [Laughter]  Sean Collins: But, and sometimes, they're allowed to go over. Like, when a crew changes or something, some of the missions, one I worked on was Expedition 52 became Expedition 54, but they wanted their patch. So, it was a stylized 52 up in space. So, then, I turned it into a stylized 54 up in space. So.  Host: OK.  Sean Collins: So, they got, you know, because they worked on their patch. They were happy with it. They wanted, but their whole crew got changed out with the other mission.  Host: Yeah.  Sean Collins: So, there were going to be Expedition 52. Now, they're 54, but they want to take their patch with them. So, we, I just made it into a 54. Same shape, and so, they didn't have to change much except the 54 in it and a couple of the names, too, the crew members.  Host: Very cool.  Sean Collins: Changed out.  Host: Do you know the number of patches and missions that you've worked on in your career? Do you have a number?  Sean Collins: That's hard.  Host: I figured.  Sean Collins: Because, you know, I worked on that one, that one, that one, that one. Designed that one, but did you really design it because you worked with a whole crew with it, you know.  Host: Sure.  Sean Collins: There's a couple that I did all the way from scratch, you know. I'd say they're in the, you know, ten in that, but there's probably 200 that I've done, I've worked on.  Host: Wow.  Sean Collins: From, and plus, I did do all the [Name of the Russian Space Station] MIR patches.  Host: Really?  Sean Collins: MIR missions, there's, you know how many? Twelve. I mean.  Host: Yeah.  Sean Collins: But, I just designed the original one, and we changed.  Host: All the ones with NASA astronauts.  Sean Collins: Yeah, I changed the names out. So, they had one patch for every mission.  Host: OK.  Sean Collins: So, that was for their MIR missions.  Host: I see.  Sean Collins: So, you know, do those. Plus, we've done side logos. You know, we used to do the ASCAN. We did do the ASCAN crew photo, crew official patch. Now, their joke patch for, they always get nicknamed one from the crew before.  Host: I see.  Sean Collins: See, that's where the hairballs or the maggots or whatever.  Host: Oh, but you make it as a fun thing for the crew office to--  Sean Collins: Yeah, we used to, but they don't fund that anymore. So, they have to go outside and get an uncle or aunt or cousin to do those.  Host: That's funny. OK. I didn't even realize that classes had patches to identify the class.  Sean Collins: Yeah.  Host: That's interesting.  Sean Collins: Well, they have an official one.  Host: Yeah.  Sean Collins: At NASA. There is one, and I put the, do their crew photos, too. I don't take the photos. It's taken by the NASA photographers. Then, I cut them out in photoshop and put another background, but always put their patch in.  Host: OK.  Sean Collins: In the photo, either ASCAN crew or shuttle crew or station crew or, you know, now commercial crews.  Host: Alright. So, it's like the number class, like class, I don't know.  Sean Collins: Yeah, 13 or yeah.  Host: Thirteen or whatever it is. OK.  Sean Collins: Yeah.  Host: Wow.  Sean Collins: So, they all get, you know, their crew photo. The crew patch gets used in other products, not just the patches and decals. So, it's placed into their poster. We do a poster for every mission, and it's funded through [Spaceflight Awareness] SFA, and they will have the crew patch in it somewhere either as a, you know, part of the design or on them or in front of them or sometimes standing on the floor and they're standing on it and photoshop. So, it's used, you know, artistically, too. You know, not just here's your one little sticker or decal.  Host: Yeah.  Sean Collins: It's put in different things.  Host: In different things. What are some of the projects that, you know, reflecting on now, are more meaningful or are a highlight of your career?  Sean Collins: Those SFA posters for each crew.  Host: The posters are a highlight.  Sean Collins: With the crew. Yeah, when we got to do the parody posters. Those were a big.  Host: Oh, yeah.  Sean Collins: You had a \"Star Wars\" one, \" The Matrix.\" What's some other ones? “Guide to the Galaxy,” \"Oceans 12\" we did. And, those were a lot of fun, and they had the crew and had the crew patch in it, too. But, so they were fun. But, now, they're getting more serious, and we don't do those anymore.  Host: Oh, OK.  Sean Collins: But, they were real popular. That was one of the funnest things I've done, working with the crews and doing that, posing them and going over, so.  Host: That sounds awesome. I know some of them, I can see them in my head because I've seen them around so many times. I find them really cool. I know there's one that was based kind of off of the graphics of \"Firefly.\" There was one, I know \"The Matrix\" one. There was one that was \"Pirates of the Caribbean.\"  Sean Collins: Yeah.  Host: That one looked pretty - you did that one, too? That one looked fun.  Sean Collins: Yeah.  Host: Because they were in costumes. Yeah.  Sean Collins: Yeah, those were my costumes. [Laughter]  Host: Were they really? This is the pirate costume. Wonderful. How about patches that are more meaningful? Something that you think has a little bit more deeper meaning in your career.  Sean Collins: Well, of course, you know, 51-L and 107.  Host: Yeah.  Sean Collins: They're, I didn't work on except for doing the lettering on 51-L, but. And, the return to flights and my first one, I guess, the STS-26 and the return to flight 114. But, a lot of them, you know, ones where, like, all of Rick's patches are meaningful because I got invited to the launches by Rick and went and saw them, you know. When you know somebody that's going up on the shuttle that's a good friend, you know, it's a different feeling. You're like, oh, hope everything's alright, you know.  Host: Yeah.  Sean Collins: So.  Host: This is Rick.  Sean Collins: Linnehan.  Host: Linnehan. OK.  Sean Collins: Great guy. Those are, all Rick's patches. LeRoy Chow, good friend, too. Those are meaningful patches to me.  Host: Some of the ones that are significant in spaceflight history but also ones with really close almost friends.  Sean Collins: Yeah.  Host: Yeah.  Sean Collins: Oh, they are friends.  Host: Yeah.  Sean Collins: And, you know some of them are kind of funny. The one that looks like the bikini.  Host: Oh, that's funny.  Sean Collins: Yeah, and the flat tire one.  Host: Flat tire.  Sean Collins: That's what I call it. I did that one in '79. What is that one? I can't see it. It's so little, forty-one I guess.  Host: Forty-one.  Sean Collins: Call that the bikini patch because it's, you know, shaped like a--  Host: It's got, like, an upside-down triangle.   Sean Collins: Yeah.  Host: That's funny. That's, so thinking about, you know, these patches, we've gone through a lot of patch ideas and fun designs, and it's just, it sounds like an absolutely fascinating career. You just sound like you've had so much fun with it throughout the years. But, do you think this is something that will stick with human spaceflight for at least the foreseeable future, if not forever? Designing patches and for specific crews and working so closely with them?  Sean Collins: Yeah. I think it does because it's such a history in it, and everybody, that's how you identify the mission, you know. You're like what mission were you on? Oh, you know, they see the patch. But, I'm thinking that they might go to where there's no names again because they're, you know, when you're over three different missions or expeditions, when you're up there for, you know, a year or two, you're going to have different people coming. I think it might be, but then, you know, the new astronauts miss out, they won't have their name on it, you know.  Host: Yeah.  Sean Collins: On the part of history, and that's how you can go back. It's history for sure, and so, take a lot of, you know. Make them. Oh, here's one, too, 133. They were working on a patch design, who was that guy I used to work with, Terry. He doesn't work there anymore, but he was working on with the crew, and then he gets a, the astronauts got a package from McCall, you know, from McCall did the mural, Bob McCall did the mural in there.  Host: That's right, yeah. We just celebrated his 100th birthday, I believe. Yeah.  Sean Collins: He, but he had passed, and this package got mailed to them after he died. But, it was already in the mail, and they got it and, oh, we're doing this. So, Terry redrew the watercolor little sketch just point to point, you know, meticulously so that it matched that watercolor sketch completely. So, that was kind of interesting that he'd already passed but his design made it to the astronauts.  Host: Wow.  Sean Collins: So, that was kind of neat. My last shuttle patch was 132, and so that's a pretty significant one for me, doing that one. I got basically designed it all the way, and you know, little tweaks from the astronauts.  Host: Yeah.  Sean Collins: That was a fun one, too.  Host: Wow. What a history. Yeah, and Robert McCall, he's got that mural right in the building next to us, that very famous mural of.  Sean Collins: He hand painted that, too. It was awesome.  Host: Very, very cool. Do you think art has a very significant place in spaceflight and history to commemorate some of these moments and engage people?  Sean Collins: Oh, yeah. That's the thing, engaging people, too. Art does that. Can be, you know, even through your podcast, engage people. You, the media, the videos, of course all the awesome photography that comes out of space, you know. I just got one today for Expedition 60, and it was a Soyuz coming at the station, and it's got, like, you know, the squiggle from the launch. You can see that.  Host: Yeah.  Sean Collins: And then, you see, like, the burst around it. I'm like, oh, I'm using that on the montage for 60 when I get that workorder. [Laughter] It'd been good for on a crew patch, too. So.  Host: I like the 60 patch because 60 came around at the 50th anniversary of Apollo 11, so that was one of the few expedition ones that had no names on it.  Sean Collins: Yeah.  Host: Yeah. I know that.  Sean Collins: I didn't do that one.  Host: Oh, you didn't do that one?  Sean Collins: I believe that was outside designer, too.  Host: Really?  Sean Collins: Think around who worked on it in my office. See, we work on these so far in advance, like the mission's going on now that we worked on it a year and a half ago, you know.  Host: Wow.  Sean Collins: So, that's, I'm, I work on stuff that happens in the future. So.  Host: Well, it's very exciting to hear about the commercial crew stuff coming up. I can't wait to see some of those, and it's been exciting to talk to you about your career and some of these highlights of these patches. I'm going to have to go back and re-listen to this podcast and listen to all the different numbers of the missions that you talked about and all of these different Easter eggs in the mission patches. What a wonderful thing because you're right. There's a lot of history, but it sounds like it's very personal to the crew, and it can tell us a unique story. Sean Collins. Thank you so much for coming on Houston, We Have a Podcast.  Sean Collins: Thank you for having me.  [ Music ]  Host: Hey, thanks for sticking around.

                        "description": "Gary Jordan (Host): Houston, we have a podcast. Welcome to the official podcast of the NASA Johnson Space Center, Episode 131, “Train Like an Astronaut.” I'm Gary Jordan. I'll be our host today. On this podcast we bring in the experts -- scientists, engineers, astronauts -- all let you know what's going on in the world of human spaceflight. We are lucky enough to bring in a number of astronauts onto this podcast. For the most part when we've talked to them they've been training for quite some time in preparation for a long duration stay on the International Space Station and they're just about to leave the country before their launch, and we investigate their unique stories of what it took to become an astronaut. Well, today we're sitting down with someone who has trained hundreds of astronauts to zero in on all the aspects of astronaut training and everything they have to endure from their first day to the moments before launching to space. So, going into the details of the intense training needed to be an astronaut today is Kathy Bolt, the Chief Training Officer and a [Capsule Communicator] Capcom here at NASA. So here we go, “Training Like an Astronaut,” with Ms. Kathy Bolt. Enjoy.  [ Music ]  Host: Kathy Bolt, thank you so much for coming on the podcast today.  Kathy Bolt: Thanks for inviting me.  Host: So, you are the, let's see, Chief Training Officer and you're a capcom. Such a cool job title, how did you get that?  Kathy Bolt: Well, I was lucky, I'll tell you that. It has been an experience. You know, I started working here some almost, what, 30 years ago now.  Host: Wow.  Kathy Bolt: It was 1991, and I started training crews in 1997 when we first started training the space station crews.  Host: I see.  Kathy Bolt: And then over the course of the last couple of decades I've just kind of grown into the position of a Chief Training Officer, and then because we work so closely with the crew then I was selected to be a capcom about 12 years ago, so I get to support them when they're on orbit even after spending time training them.  Host: So, what does it take then to -- I guess there's this proximity to the crew that really helps you to hone those skills and understand their needs, what is it about being so close to the crew that helps you communicate effectively to them?  Kathy Bolt: Well, I think it's just going through their training and seeing them in training for the two and a half years we have them in ground training before they ever fly. So as a Chief Training Officer it's my job to organize that flow of their training from beginning to end and even continue with onboard training once they're in-flight. So, I have this wide variety of experiences of just watching them in training, observing them and also role playing the ground team in many of their training sessions. So, they get used to hearing my voice as a capcom through training and then I can do it real-time once they get onboard as well.  Host: And that's what a capcom does, right?  Kathy Bolt: Yes.  Host: A capcom sits in Mission Control and you are the voice talking to the crew. Everyone is telling you all these different pieces of information and you're the one that has to be that filter to the crew.  Kathy Bolt: Right.  Host: And have that, and because you're so close to them, you have that relationship, they understand your voice then, and you know how to talk to them in a way that makes sense to them for what I guess other flight controllers are asking?  Kathy Bolt: Yes, yeah, that's the goal anyway, I will say that is the goal, and it really does help to have that personal connection with the crews, which is why I think the training folks that we have as capcoms are usually really good.  Host: Yeah, well, tell me about some of your -- you talked earlier in your career, you got here in '91, you said you started crew training in '97, what skills did you build to eventually make your way to crew training?  Kathy Bolt: Well, to be honest, I was a software programmer --  Host: Oh.  Kathy Bolt: -- those first five or six years and that's just, that's how I got my foot in the door. Whenever I was a kid I wanted to grow-up and work for NASA, I wanted to be an astronaut at that time. Ever since I've started training them I've decided training is more my style than actually being the astronaut, but my goal was get out of college and go work for NASA. So, I started out as a Software Developer, and then my company was actually swallowed up into United Space Alliance which was the company that essentially took over all of the training and operations for the space shuttle back in 1996. And when that company got incorporated into United Space Alliance then that opened up a door for me to do other things and that's when I found out about Station Training because they were just starting to hire people to start building a space station training program. They had trainers for shuttle crews and training about how to fly the shuttle vehicle, but they were just hiring people to start training for the International Space Station and figuring out what a training flow was even going to look like for the International Space Station at that time. So that's when I joined.  Host: So, you mentioned joining because you already had interest in NASA, when did that spark?  Kathy Bolt: With the very first space shuttle launch in 1981. [Laughter]  Host: Wow.  Kathy Bolt: I was in like sixth grade at the time and I knew then that NASA was where I always wanted to work and have the opportunity. My goal was to meet and to know an astronaut and now I know every astronaut and every cosmonaut and every [International Partner] IP astronaut and it's just one of those things that I'm eternally humbled and grateful --  Host: Wow.  Kathy Bolt: -- to where I am today, and it's only been through I would say divine intervention getting me through all the different wickets that I've gone through.  Host: Well, let's fast forward to meeting your first astronaut when you were here. I guess in a training capacity, when you were actually in the role what was that like those first couple of astronauts training?  Kathy Bolt: It was actually very interesting, so the very first crews I trained was Expedition One, which was Bill Shepherd, and then we had Sergei Krikalev and Yuri Gidzenko--  Host: That's right.  Kathy Bolt: -- for those three. And so at that time it was a very different era, you know, as far as like our two Russians, they weren't all that familiar with how the female trainers at the time and then Bill was very, we call him Shep, Shep was always very focused on the details of learning stuff, so you really had to know your stuff because he was going to ask you a lot of questions, and the Russians were just like I don't know if I want to listen to you or not.  Host: Wow.  Kathy Bolt: But we grew into that and we earned their respect, we learned what we needed to learn just in time to teach them what they needed to learn, and then over the course of several years we had them in training we gradually earned their respect, so.  Host: You make it sound so simple, but I'm sure it was not.  Kathy Bolt: It was tough.  Host: I mean that's a tough crew, that's a tough crew --  Kathy Bolt: Yes.  Host: -- when you have something against you and you have this almost demand to perform at the highest level and to prove that you are the person that needs --  Kathy Bolt: That can do it.  Host: -- that can do it, that can do the job.  Kathy Bolt: Yeah, and it was a team of us, I was only one of a team --  Host: Yeah.  Kathy Bolt: -- that was supporting all of them, but all of us had that goal in mind, to prove ourselves first, learn what we needed to know and then be able to make sure we were training them on what we thought was important at the time. And things change over time, but from the first thing you train to what we train today is very different, but that's the process you have to go through.  Host: I would love to explore that, let's do that, like that's basically the basis of this podcast is how that has changed and what all takes place. And part of that let's start with you said you were a station trainer and you were training for station, but the legacy before that was shuttle. I'm sure you pulled some lessons and some practices from shuttle to some of those first crews that were training for expeditions on the space station.  Kathy Bolt: Yes, absolutely. So, for shuttle we trained the crew members how to fly that vehicle starting with individual systems training, when they had to know every single switch and button and circuit breaker inside that cockpit because everything was manual on the space shuttle. I mean there was a few things you could do from the ground, but the engine, while the crew was flying the vehicle. And so, when we first started training for the space station not really knowing how the software was going to really work, you have ideas, you know, and you have proofs of concepts, but nobody really trusts the software until it has been demonstrated for a while. So, we actually started training our space station crews to be very similar to our shuttle crews and we taught them a whole lot of details of how to operate every single little thing, how to go behind the panels and open things up and do all kinds of stuff. And then once we had the first couple of crews fly and they came back and said we hardly used any of what you trained --  Host: Oh.  Kathy Bolt: -- because the ground did it all, you know? It was a very different concept, the ground controllers, mission control, they actually fly the space station. The crew can go up there and be the scientists, they can do maintenance on the space station, the hands-on stuff that we need, and they can focus on science, and then the ground team is who actually flies the vehicle and makes all the changes, sends commands to it and all that kind of stuff. That was such a different concept between what we had learned on shuttle and what we had to learn for the space station. And so, we evolved our training because of that.  Host: Wow, that's such a different mindset.  Kathy Bolt: A very different mindset, yes.  Host: Now I'm sure you with your software background you had some kind of inkling that that was maybe going to be the case?  Kathy Bolt: Maybe, but I think we were just all so -- the only thing we knew was space shuttle --  Host: Right.  Kathy Bolt: -- and how to train. Well, I mean I'm sure the people before us obviously knew the early days, but shuttle was the only thing that we'd been training for 15 years and that was the only model we had at the time and so we just started with that model, but over time we've had to adjust that.  Host: Yes.  Kathy Bolt: And I see the same thing happening with our commercial crew partners today. You know, they are starting with, both of them, with brand-new vehicles that they think they understand and they have software that is designed to operate it, but until it gets some time, actually flight time and we learn how the crews are going to operate it then we're just guessing at what we should focus our training on. We've got a whole set of things we think are the right things and that's what we're training the early crews, but I can see that evolving in the years ahead as we get more experience, so.  Host: That's right, yeah, we can explore that too. I want to go back to station for just a second, you talked about there was almost a shift on what you thought you had to prioritize based on what you knew from shuttle and so you focused on that for station there, like, ah, we don't need that, so what was the refocus, what were you starting to bring into the training flow to fill that gap of now you don't know --  Kathy Bolt: What do we really need?  Host: Yes?  Kathy Bolt: That's a good question. So what we changed instead of teaching minute details about all of the different systems, like the electrical power system and the computer system and everything, we decided to take it up a level and just teach kind of a foundational knowledge of all of the different systems, recognizing that if they got into serious trouble in any of those systems the ground team was going to be there to help resolve the issue. So, we looked at what things can cause the crew to be completely on their own, what are the malfunctions that will cause them to not have ground support and, therefore, have to respond by themselves. And then so we started looking at all those different scenarios and it turns out there's only about four, five major scenarios that we can truly focus on and make sure they know how to recover from. One is like a major power failure that takes out their communication and how do they diagnose it and how they comm back with the ground, those are important steps we need to train. Emergencies, obviously, a fire depressor, ammonia, we focus on that a lot because those have to be instinctual responses. And then also things like loss of attitude control because again when you're spinning out of control you may lose comm and so how the crew needs to know how to get comm back and how to regain attitude control. So that's how it ended up evolving is looking for those things that can actually really cause the crew to have to do it on their own without ground team, and then the focus is not have them fix it all,  but have them get comm back so that then they can hand it back over to the ground team to take over and do all the details.  Host: That's an important distinction.  Kathy Bolt: It's a huge distinction.  Host: Yeah, having that ability. You said almost like the priority is, OK, yeah, we're spinning out of control, we have to make sure we understand how to regain communication because communication is a support team with plenty of people --  Kathy Bolt: Thousands of people on the ground.  Host: Thousands of people on the ground that can help you --  Kathy Bolt: Right.  Host: -- and resolve the issues because, like you said, a lot of those components, those intricate details they're controlled from the ground.  Kathy Bolt: Right.  Host: So that makes a lot of sense.  Kathy Bolt: Yeah, so that's where we evolved, and our training flows started focusing on those types of scenarios and then also just routine day in the life things, like we changed our flows to actually have the crew practice a day in the life of space station. So, our Building 9 mockups, we have the entire space station modules in Building 9 and it's the only place in the world that we have all of the modules, including most of our Russia modules there as well. And that used to just be, when I first started it was really just a Public Affairs building, all the gee whiz, let's look at this, it really wasn't much of a training facility. But we have grown into that being one of our prime training facilities because we needed people to actually put them in the environment, so put them in the U.S. Lab, put them in the Columbus module or the Node 1 module and have them use the tools that they're going to use on a daily basis for six months up there and get used to that, and not just teach them piece parts, but actually put the whole picture together, so.  Host: Yeah, see from a Public Affairs' perspective I'm like, man, there's all this training going on, I need to do a tour, I need to do a media interview, come on.  Kathy Bolt: I'm sure.  Host: It's always buys.  Kathy Bolt: It is always busy now and that's one of the things I got to do as part of my early jobs was define and grow that training that we put in Building 9 because initially it was hard, people were a little hesitant to put things in Building 9 because it's hard to schedule, you know, lots of things like that. But we're just like it is so important for the crews to see that realistic environment for the big events -- emergency training, the day in the life stuff, seeing stowage, cargo ops -- all of those things are important in the environment and not just talked about in a classroom.  Host: So that's really the benefit then is when you put them in that environment they have maybe more spatial training than maybe just a classroom that -- because I guess the thought process is in the event of an emergency you have to react quick, you have to know where things are, you have to know kind of the direction you're going.  Kathy Bolt: That's true.  Host: So, having that training on the ground, whereas, up, down, left, right where is everything?  Kathy Bolt: Exactly.  Host: That is critical to the training.  Kathy Bolt: Very critical, where is your emergency mask, where is the --  Host: Yes.  Kathy Bolt: -- the combustion analyzer that's going to tell me whether my air is safe to breathe, where are those things physically located? What modules do I have to fly through to get to them? So, yes, absolutely, and we do that here for the integrated U.S. and Russia emergency training and then in Russia they get even more training on just the emergencies on the Russian segment because they have more of the Russia modules actually out at Moscow in the training facility there, so.  Host: So that's going to be, we can dive into all the different parts or all the different things that the crews have to do including travel to go different places and learn all of these systems. One thing I did want to say was you talked about the progression of training from when you first started at station, learning from shuttle and adapting along the way, even you said the first three missions were rapid with how you were training the crews. You went from this minute detail to more of a broad perspective. How has it changed even to now, now that we've had nearly 20 years of continuous presence how has that training evolved over that time?  Kathy Bolt: I would say that what I've talked about has been the evolution over the last 20 years, not just the initial few years.  Host: Sure.  Kathy Bolt: But that's when I got started, you know, so after every crew we're always looking for feedback on what is it that you need more of or what is it that we need to focus more on? And I think in the last like five years is where we've finally hit the mark.  Host: Wow.  Kathy Bolt: On focusing on the right things for our crews. We focus on, you know, their payload training, on their science and the emergencies, and then these day in the life things.  Host: Yeah.  Kathy Bolt: And everything else is foundation level, but we don't dive down into those details like we used to expect, and I just feel like we've finally gotten there.  Host: Yeah, that makes sense, I like that breakdown because the payloads are the things that they're working all the time.  Kathy Bolt: Right.  Host: These are the experiments, these are the science things, they're really tricky and they have to do them for hours and hours, so.  Kathy Bolt: Right, and that's what they're going to do most of their time up there.  Host: That's what they're going to do most of the time.  Kathy Bolt: Or maintenance.  Host: Yes, maintenance, too.  Kathy Bolt: And we teach them all about that.  Host: Yeah, the emergencies, always good to have that in the back of your mind just in case anything happens.  Kathy Bolt: Yes, have to have that.  Host: Ready to go at any time. And then day of a life, of course, you're living on the space station, you need to learn how to do that effectively.  Kathy Bolt: Yes, and that's actually one of the hardest things I think we can't train as well on the ground. We can put them in Building 9, we can give them a day in the life simulation, but just the physical working in zero G, you can't simulate that anywhere.  Host: Yeah.  Kathy Bolt: Even though we have a little, you know, buttons in Building 9 that we pretend like we give them zero G, so the folks looking on the catwalk think that. But anyway, it's the first few weeks onboard is always adaptive, it's time for them to really figure out how do I let this thing go and where is it going to go when I let it go? Is it going to stay right there, or did I put a little bit of pressure on it and now it's flying across this module and I've got to go find it again? Or is the air circulating in this particular spot and, therefore, I need to Velcro it or something? There's just all this stuff that we really, we can give them ideas and thoughts and we let them talk with previous crews to get those ideas, but the experience when they get up there is always going to have to just take a little bit of time.  Host: Yeah, and I know that's carved out, right, whenever they get up there there's specific time --  Kathy Bolt: Yes, they have some adaptive time, yeah, exactly.  Host: Adaptive time. So, let's go through astronaut training from start to finish.  Kathy Bolt: OK.  Host: We have at the time of this recording, just in a couple days, we're going to have astronaut candidates graduate, the 2017 class, so that's really exciting. They've gone through two years now of training for that moment. What have they been focusing on for the first two years that they've been astronauts?  Kathy Bolt: That's a really great question. And I have the privilege of being the Training Lead for the [Astronaut Candidates] ASCAN class. This particular ASCAN class, and so they have been focusing in the last, it's really been two and a half years for them, they started in August of 2017 and they have been focusing on getting that foundational level of space station systems, so understanding the big picture of all the different systems. Understanding those major malfunctions that we talked about, we've actually given them what we call masteries, our tests to make sure they know how to respond to every single one of those major ones that we've talked about, and they've all passed with flying colors on that. And then they've been doing [Extravehicular Activity] EVA, or spacewalk training out at the Neutral Buoyancy Lab, the EVA training has been focused on repetitive skills because all the EVAs have certain skills that the crew members need to know how to do. You need to know how to stay safe, keep your tethers on, you need to know how to use the tools, you need to know how to get yourself situated where you can move with some flexibility, but yet you're not spinning around because you've really got to get your work done. There's a lot of different skills and so they've been, it takes them like 9 NBL runs to go through those basic skills and get to just a certain stage where now they can then go focus on more advanced spacewalking skills and maybe practice for a real spacewalk and actually run through a timeline of that.  Host: And the Neutral Buoyancy Laboratory, this is that pool where they suit-up and they basically simulate, they write some procedures together and I guess they're more skills based?  Kathy Bolt: Yes.  Host: So how to use the tools, get around?  Kathy Bolt: For the initial astronaut candidates, we start with just the skills.  Host: Got it.  Kathy Bolt: And work up to them doing a timeline of here's a day, here's six hours of a time you're going to spend from getting out of the airlock to going and performing a task and then coming back into the airlock. They get to that by the end of Run 9, but it's a work up to that, building their skills.  Host: Yes, it's a lot of work and I guess it's not intuitive but having those skills by the end of Run 9, yeah, they're doing spacewalks.  Kathy Bolt: Right.  Host: That's pretty cool.  Kathy Bolt: Right, and so they've done that. They've got robotics training, robotics is another big key. We need them to get a generic set of skills before they move on to their assigned training where they'll get more specific skills. This is just like how to control the arm, how to understand where the arm is going to move based on the inputs of your controllers and all that stuff. So, they've gone through that.  Host: That's the Canadarm 2 that's on the space station, they train to maneuver that and capture things and move things.  Kathy Bolt: To maneuver that, yes, the track and capture pieces come later when they're actually assigned the early astronaut training for the ASCANs is more of just how do I operate the arm as a whole so that when they're moving it they have a clear understanding of where it's going to move because it's a very complex part. [Laughter] I have tried to learn, I've been through their training, but I'm not very good at it.  Host: Oh, wow, yeah, there's a lot of axis --  Kathy Bolt: Yes, way too many.  Host: -- and just different -- yeah, yeah, so it's --  Kathy Bolt: Too many degrees of freedom there. [laughter]  Host: Very cool. Yeah, I guess that makes sense why that would be part of their initial training flow that's a critical thing that they have to know and learn how to do.  Kathy Bolt: Absolutely, yeah.  Host: That's capturing cargo, doing repairs, all these different things that are very important.  Kathy Bolt: Yeah, some of the other things are they all have to learn Russian.  Host: OK.  Kathy Bolt: Russian to a certain language level and so that's one of the key things they've had to focus on. And the same is true for cosmonauts, they have to learn English to a certain level. But all of our astronauts have to learn the Russian. And then also T-38 flight training, they've -- we have the pilots that do the front seat training, so they learn how to fly the T-38s, and then anyone that has come in that does not have a pilot background, then they get back seat T-38 training, and so essentially they're trained to be that back seat helper or support person. That way they can travel where they need to go with a pilot astronaut that can take them if they need to travel on the T-38s.  Host: OK.  Kathy Bolt: But it's one of those teams-based skills that we try and focus on as well as the flight experience, so.  Host: Yeah, which is pretty important. I hear from a lot of the astronauts that I've talked to that almost, I guess for the most part I hear that Russian language training is probably one of the more difficult ones.  Kathy Bolt: It is, definitely one of the most difficult, unless you're one of those people that just loves languages.  Host: Yes.  Kathy Bolt: And there's always one or two that come in already knowing a lot of languages and Russian is easy, and then you have people like me who I've looked at the Russian language and had a few classes and I still can't teach it, talk it or say anything. But they have to get to a certain level and that does take a lot of practice and a lot of study.  Host: So, for your role as the Chief Training Officer, now obviously you're not going to be in the front seat flying the T-38 and saying, all right, this is how you do stuff, what's your role, how are you actually working through their training process?  Kathy Bolt: So, my role is to work with the team of instructors who do do all of those individual pieces. So, I had the Russian training instructors on my team. I had T-38 representatives on my team. I have all the space station system trainers on my team. So, I have a team of instructors that actually do the teaching and it's my job to just make sure that it's an integrated training flow and so that they're getting scheduled for all the right things, that we're putting it in a logical format, that we have everything ready for them. Like they had to go off and do the T-38 training in Pensacola initially, so we had to make sure that all of that was set up for them for the non-pilots.  Host: Yes.  Kathy Bolt: Yeah, there's just a lot of organization that I do to make sure that that training flow is executed. And then the last part I do is the routine ops and the emergency training is something that I lead as the team, we have a team of instructors that do it, but it's my job to make sure that they execute everything, get to the point where we can, we know that they have successfully passed that training.  Host: But, yeah, you said two and a half years they're going through their training, you are the conductor, you are the one that's making sure that they are, they have that flow to get them through and graduate.  Kathy Bolt: Right.  Host: Right when they need to graduate with all the necessary skills, and like you said they all passed.  Kathy Bolt: Right.  Host: That's great.  Kathy Bolt: They did wonderful, it was a great group to work with. And let me say one thing, so my job is, like you said, orchestrating that flow.  Host: Yes.  Kathy Bolt: But there is a group of ladies in the Astronaut Office, the ASCAN scheduler and then what we call our International Training Integrators or ITIs, and these ladies are the ones who actually put all the pieces together. So, I tell them here's the flow, here's the order, and here's the big pieces that we want and we kind of want them in these timeframes, and they go, and they actually do all the scheduling of it and make sure it will happen, what will fit within a week. The International Training Integrators are the ones that figure out when are they in the United States, when are they in Russia, when are they in Europe or when are they in Japan. And so, it's a joint effort to make all of those pieces come together.  Host: Very much so, a joint effort, a massive effort.  Kathy Bolt: A massive effort, yes.  Host: Sounds like a lot of work.  Kathy Bolt: Yes.  Host: Well, that's awesome. How do you feel about to see them graduate here in a few days?  Kathy Bolt: I'm excited to see them graduate, yes. It was so fun to be able to work with them and to see them come in as just fresh new astronauts excited to be at NASA and to train them and to see them grow into who they are today and understand and seeing that development has been a pleasure. I've really enjoyed it. And the next step that nearly all of them are going to do is become capcoms.  Host: Oh.  Kathy Bolt: And so I get to mentor them as they move into the capcom flow as well because that's one of the next things we want for them to do after they get out of their astronaut training is to become a capcom because then when they get assigned to fly on an actual mission they will understand how the ground works because they have been in mission control and they understand what the capcom job is to communicate with them. So, when they're up there being the ones communicating down to the ground they understand all the logistics of what's happening and that's an extremely important transition I think that they have to go through, and so I'll get to continue to see them do that side of it soon.  Host: Yeah, well, that's a big key point is really they are transitioning --  Kathy Bolt: Yes.  Host: -- to just more training. They've studied, they've taken tests, they've gone through all these --  Kathy Bolt: Yes.  Host: -- different scenarios to prepare to become officially astronauts from astronaut candidates and now they're just ready for that next step, which is more training, but let's go into some of that. And starting with the operations, I think that's a good place to start, you said you're going to train them to be capcoms, so what is that going to be like? What are they -- what skills are they going to have to learn, what's the training to actually get them accustomed to learning the operations and the lingo and the protocol so they can say the right things and then be that person on console, that you are, that's communicating to the crew?  Kathy Bolt: Well, the thing that they need, they already have the foundations, but with what they've gone through in the last two years, two plus years, what they need now is practicing in that communication. So, we put them in simulations.  Host: OK.  Kathy Bolt: And so they'll end up doing anywhere from five to ten simulations, and in the simulations with the ground team we throw a whole lot of things at them, like big failures and massive, you know, big things that go wrong so that the ground team has to figure out how to deal with it and then the capcom has to tell the crew that -- it's a pretend crew, it's obviously not the real crew --  Host: Sure.  Kathy Bolt: -- but we have them practice how they would communicate what's happening with all these failures that are going in during these simulations. And so that's what it takes because they've already got all of the foundational knowledge that they need, now just put it together, be able to listen to what everyone is saying in mission control and put it in your own words. And sometimes that's easy and sometimes that's hard, there's some people that take to it really quickly and they can very easily listen to all these conversations and then put it in your own words and communicate very clearly up to the crew, and there's others that need a little bit more finesse and practice and that only comes with just doing more sims and teaching them, you know, guiding them along the way on how best to communicate certain things. So, I don't know, it's just one of those things. [Laughter]  Host: Yeah, is that one of the aspects of your job that you enjoy being capcom?  Kathy Bolt: I love being a capcom, yes. It's one of the -- I consider it a privilege to be able to be a capcom. It's kind of an extra job, it's not something that I do day to day, but it is something that I love to sign up for shifts and to support, especially when it's a crew that I've trained with.  Host: Yes.  Kathy Bolt: To be up there. And so, it's just every time I drive up into that parking lot of mission control and I park in that spot that says ISS capcom -- I think of the responsibility of what I'm about to go in and do, what could potentially happen, and then I'm just humbled that I get to park there and be that person for the day. And there's so many other people like me that do it as well, but it's an honor, it's a privilege.  Host: What a feeling, yeah, that's got to be awesome, you're the voice to the crew.  Kathy Bolt: Exactly, yes.  Host: And, like you said, you've spent some time with them, you've trained them, and you have a relationship with them.  Kathy Bolt: Yes.  Host: It's almost like talking with your friends, your family.  Kathy Bolt: Yes, I'll tell you one story, I hope this is OK. That one, I had one crew that I worked with and it had two rookie Russian cosmonauts, neither one of them had flown and which is unusual. A lot of the times we have repeat fires for Russian cosmonauts, but this particular crew had two rookies and then I had a U.S. crew member who had flown on shuttle but had never done the long duration space station. So, kind of they were all three fairly new guys, and I spent the whole two and a half years training them, I traveled with them around. I was in Russia with them, I was in Europe and Japan with them, got to know them all really well. And right before their launch the commander came up to me and he's like, “Kathy, are you going to be on console when we arrive?” And I'm like, oh, yeah, I've already signed up for it, I'm going to be capcom. When you arrive, when you go through that door I'm going to be capcom. It's like, “OK, good, because as soon as we get done with the family interviews I'm going down to the U.S. segment and I'm going to have the two rookies talk to you first because they're going to be nervous to talk on the space to ground for the very first time.”  Host: Yeah.  Kathy Bolt: And we want, I want them to talk to you, and so they did.  Host: Wow.  Kathy Bolt: It was the best moment of my career because I saw them do their family thing and then sure enough I saw them head down, we had the video up, I saw them head down to the U.S. segment and I get the phone call or get the phone call on space to ground and then I just get to have this conversation with them. And they were just so happy because they were talking to someone they had talked to for two and a half years, and then after that they were just fine, they didn't need any more than that, so it was all good. [Laughter]  Host: Wow.  Kathy Bolt: But that's the type of bonding you can get when you work with a team or a crew for that long.  Host: Yeah, that's really important because I guess that certain level of comfort will help them be successful. They're looking for you, they want your support because they do want to be successful in that communication.  Kathy Bolt: Right.  Host: And that level of ease will help them to do that.  Kathy Bolt: Yes, yes.  Host: So, there is a wonderful aspect to that.  Kathy Bolt: And he was just breaking the ice for them, yes.  Host: Yeah, yeah.  Kathy Bolt: Really that's all it was, but it was a special moment for me that I got to be a part of that, so.  Host: Wonderful. Yes, operations training, super important for these next steps after they're graduating to become astronauts, from astronaut candidates. What else are they in for when it comes to training and getting ready for those next missions?  Kathy Bolt: Well, once they get through the initial training for the spacewalks and robotics and stuff then we have a lot of proficiency training, so proficiency is just doing the same skills over and over again and adding some new things to it. So, they're going to continue to go through robotics and EVA training even during this time before they're assigned an actual mission. The capcom thing we've already talked about. And then they'll also start doing more probably maintenance and payload, our science training. Some of our astronauts come in with a whole lot of experience on maintenance and tools and other stuff, and then there's people like me who know nothing about, you know, you could put a tool in front of me I wouldn't even know what it's called probably because I just don't work with that.  Host: Sure.  Kathy Bolt: And so, you have that diversity with our astronaut classes as well. And so for those that are, that don't have as much familiarity with tools and the use of tools, then we have some of what we call field maintenance training, our field medical training for folks that don't have a good, have much of a medical background, and those are the types of things that we try and put them in when they're unassigned. So, they've been through their ASCAN training, they're not assigned to a mission yet, so how do we shore-up all of the skills to make them set-up for success as soon as they do get that assignment and those are the types of things we'll do. So, they'll go out for maintenance training, they'll go out to Ellington Field and work with the maintenance technicians for the T-38 for like a week or two at a time.  Host: Oh.  Kathy Bolt: And they're following the procedures of the maintenance guys out there, but they're learning how to utilize the tools and all that stuff and they come out, away understanding so much more than they could if we just told them, yes, that's a wrench and that's a socket or that's this, but actually doing something with it is the key on learning how to utilize it.  Host: Yes, now that is huge, like we mentioned this in the beginning when it comes to breaking down what they'll actually be doing on space station, maintenance is one of those things.  Kathy Bolt: Maintenance is one of them.  Host: A lot of time going to be dedicated to that.  Kathy Bolt: Right.  Host: You're going to fix things, you're going to have to pull racks out, you're going to have to know exactly which tools to use so that's huge. The other thing we talked about was science, payloads, being able to do that, and now I'm sure that's a huge part of their training as well.  Kathy Bolt: It is, and we try and get some of that during those two and a half years, but there's always more, you know? So, there's, you know, we do actually a lot of rodent training, understanding how do we take care of the rodents that we send up there for science. Also bio training, how they handle cell cultures and DNA samples and all that kind of stuff because there's so much intricate work that they have to perform for scientists here on the ground, but the astronaut is the hands and the eyes up onboard and so we need to train them, you know, what are the safe practices, what are the clean room practices you want to make sure that you observe when you're doing the science experiment for the people on the ground, so.  Host: See, while you're describing this I'm starting to get a better sense of just what it takes to be an astronaut because I'm thinking of when you're designing those training flows you said you'll put them in and have them work on the T-38s for a week, it's almost like they're putting on that hat and they're thinking like a technician and they have to think like a technician for a week and then, OK, now switch hats, put on your scientist hat and now you've got to think like a scientist for a week.  Kathy Bolt: Yes.  Host: It's these different mindsets and they're all smashed together into this one person called an astronaut that has to do everything onboard.  Kathy Bolt: That's a really good description.  Host: Yeah.  Kathy Bolt: And I think that's what this crew feels like when they're in that two-and-a-half-year training flow, either for the assigned mission or as an ASCAN because every day it may have a different focus. Today I may be learning just about the electrical power system on the space station and tomorrow I might be in the pool doing a spacewalk, and completely different skillsets, completely different mindsets, but it's all in this week.  Host: Yeah.  Kathy Bolt: Yeah.  Host: So, when you're designing those flows how do you ensure that they're going to retain that information or be able to recall it?  Kathy Bolt: It's a good question.  Host: Yeah.  Kathy Bolt: I think repetition is the best way.  Host: That makes sense.  Kathy Bolt: You know, again for the ASCANs we train them on certain skills so that we build a foundation and then it's that repetition, our proficiency training that we want to call it, where we just keep them up to date. And then there are some tests along the way, you know, they have to pass certain quals as a robotics operator, they have to pass certain quals as a spacewalk EVA to be able to be assigned to that, and they have to pass certain masteries is what we call them for the space station systems, how to handle those big failures. They actually have a test that they have to pass, and then after they pass those tests we just try and make sure that they see it periodically until they get assigned as a real crew, and then we're very focused on making sure they get lots of repetition before they fly.  Host: Yeah, I see it on their timeline, sometimes even when they're in space some refresher training --  Kathy Bolt: Yeah.  Host: -- particularly when it comes to the robotics.  Kathy Bolt: Robotics, yes.  Host: I know that like you're about to capture a dragon, OK, let's make sure I know how to capture a cargo vehicle.  Kathy Bolt: Right, we have what's called onboard training for OBT flow for crews, it leads up to every single cargo mission, it'll lead up to probably our crew missions coming forward, but anytime they use the robotic arm because it's so dangerous if you do something wrong.  Host: Right.  Kathy Bolt: Then you want to make sure that they're comfortable with it, and so we set-up a flow that allows them to get some time dedicated while you're onboard to refresh those skills.  Host: Yeah, it's almost like, you know, I'm trying to think of what it would take to work through that training and there's like, how I'm imagining it is some sort of, there's a logical flow of information and thought process that have to go into a task. So if you're, for example, I said your scientist hat, you have to think like a scientist, you have to make sure you're putting on your gloves, that you're working in a sterile environment, that you're doing it in a certain way, but that's a different process, a different way of logically thinking than doing robotic arm training. That's just a different way, so to almost rewire your brain, I would think to rewire your brain to think like a robotic arm operator right before you do the task is super important.  Kathy Bolt: Yeah.   Host: Yeah.  Kathy Bolt: It is.  Host: You mentioned emergency training, that was another one that you said was very critical when you were onboard, to have that always in the back of your mind, now what are those training flows like?  Kathy Bolt: So, for emergencies, there's three types of emergencies on the space station. There's either fire or a rapid depress where you're losing atmosphere, or it could be a toxic atmosphere, and really about the main toxic atmosphere that you could have on space station is if we have an ammonia leak because there's ammonia in our external modules that are --  Host: That's how it cools the outside of the space station.  Kathy Bolt: Right, yeah, there are radiators. And so we focus the crew on how to respond to those three types of emergencies and that includes where to find the mask, and how do I don the mask that I need for the breathing protection, how do I analyze the situation and put out the fire if it's a fire, or how do I close all the hatches in a logical sequence so that I can maybe find which module is leaking if I'm losing pressure somewhere. And then for the toxic atmosphere we have a special mask that they have to put on, they have to purge it because they could literally be one breath to death if they don't get that mask on properly.  Host: Wow.  Kathy Bolt: And so, we want to make sure that they are trained instinctually to find that mask, get it on, and be safe.  Host: So, this is where that Building 9 training comes in.  Kathy Bolt: Exactly.  Host: Having that spatial training to understand where things are is super important to this emergency procedure.  Kathy Bolt: Right, absolutely, all the emergency training is done in Building 9, other than the initial classroom lessons where we just talk about the philosophy. Here's in general what it's going to look like, and then all the rest of it is hands-on in Building 9 or in Russia because they also do the -- there's a whole different set of equipment and a whole different response if the emergency is on the Russian side and if it's on the U.S. side. And part of that is just because of the way they were built, like fire response on the U.S. side, the crew leaves the segment and they don't fight the fire initially because the U.S. segment is designed to put the fire out. It's very compartmented little sections and once you burn all the oxygen in that one little section it should put itself out, so it shouldn't propagate, at least that's the design. And so, our firefighting philosophy takes that into account.  Host: Yeah.  Kathy Bolt: On the Russian side their modules are not compartmentalized, they have stuff behind racks or behind panels that flow from one end of the module to the other end of the module, so if a fire starts anywhere in the middle it could go anywhere. And so, you know, it's a different philosophy. If the fire is on the Russian side you're going to be opening up those panels and with fire extinguisher and you're going to be putting it out right then and there, you're not going anywhere, you're looking to save the station.  Host: Wow.  Kathy Bolt: On the U.S. side we're going to evacuate and make sure you're safe and then we'll go see if the fire is out and if it's not we can do something about it to make the fire go out, but we're not going to worry about save it immediately kind of thing.  Host: So, figuring out where the fire is is almost the first step to the next set of procedures because depending on where it is you have a different line of --  Kathy Bolt: That's exactly what it is, yes.  Host: Wow.  Kathy Bolt: First step, find the smoke, see which module it's in and then that directs your response, but--  Host: Yes, and this is actually -- we've been talking a lot about space station training because that's your focus, right? You were talking about when you go to the space station these are the things you have to think about. They're also going to be on other vehicles, too, right? They go to the Soyuz, they go to Moscow and they train, or maybe it's Star City --  Kathy Bolt: Star City, yeah.  Host: -- to train for the Soyuz and they learn all the different parts about that vehicle and then they have to think about when they go to the space station this is what they have to think about when they're there.  Kathy Bolt: Right.  Host: One thing I think we did talk about, this was the last part in your sequence, so this is what they're going to train the most with is day in the life, how to live, so what is that like, learning exactly how to just carry yourself when it comes to space station life?  Kathy Bolt: So after we teach them all the basics of, you know, these are the tools you're going to have, these are the computers you're going to have, this is how you keep track of all of your stuff, we have what's called an Inventory Management Database System that tells them where all of their clothes are, all of their food is, every single tool is. And so, they need to know how to utilize all those tools, and then we put them in what we call a day in the life sim, usually in Building 9, they're nearly all in Building 9 because again you can put them inside the space station mockups. You give them a timeline of activities, just like they would have onboard, and then they have to then just utilize those tools that they've been trained on to get through that set of tasks. Find all of your equipment that's hidden behind all of these storage lockers, we don't just set it out for them, they have to go and find the piece here, find another piece in this module, find another piece in this module, and then I've got it all so now I can go work on something. That's the way it's going to be when they get onboard, so we want to do that for them in Building 9 as well, so.  Host: Oh, that'd be fun, it's like scavenger hunt training. [Laughter]  Kathy Bolt: It is scavenger hunt, we do have some scavenger hunts, yeah. We also have the toilet and the galley setup so that they can practice the use of, not actually really using the toilet, but go through the motions of what they would have to do to use the toilet.  Host: Right.  Kathy Bolt: Know how to turn it on. We often throw malfunctions at them so that they would have to talk about how, what would I do if I saw these lights come on and what's the response and how do I fix it? Also, for the galley we have all of that mocked up in Building 9 as well, the galleys, how they prepare their food. We don't have any actual water that they can put into their food or heat it up, but we have all of the components to where they can practice what it is they would do. And where we've been working to try and get the actual galley that is working, which is currently in Building 5, it's a different building. We've been trying to get that moved over to Building 9 so that we can make it more realistic and actually have them put their food together, but so far, we haven't done that just yet. But for the ASCANs we have them just go over to Building 5 and utilize the galley themselves so that they can get used to figuring out how do I prepare my own food, how do I get my drinks ready for the day, where do I store them when I want them to be cold and not just lukewarm?  Host: Right.  Kathy Bolt: All of those things are things that we kind of try and make sure they know.  Host: Yes, because during their lunch break they want to know how to make the food, how to make it the way they want to make it.  Kathy Bolt: Yeah.  Host: And definitely the bathroom is a very important part of living in space and if anything goes wrong it is a complicated piece of equipment, so learning how to deal with that, all very important.  Kathy Bolt: Yeah.  Host: We did, I did sort of mention working with other vehicles besides the space station. I know one of the things moving forward is now introduced into their training flow is working with commercial crew vehicles.  Kathy Bolt: That's correct.  Host: This is something that's relatively new, and we're going to be flying them this year.  Kathy Bolt: Yeah, I'm excited.  Host: Yeah, so it's real, it's happening.  Kathy Bolt: It is.  Host: What are we doing to train them for these vehicles?  Kathy Bolt: Well, I'll tell you it's a whole new concept because since we stopped flying the space shuttle the only access has been through the Soyuz and the Russians, they train the Soyuz, that's the vehicle that goes up and comes down and the Russians solely train that. So, to have our crews actually training the vehicle that's going to take them up and bring them home is just something we haven't had to do in a really long time. So, the focus for those companies is to teach them what it is they need to know for the launch and for the journey up there and the rendezvous and the docking, which are the key parts, and then how to undock and come home safely. And those, that sounds easy when you think of it just in these big parts, but you think of all the things that can go wrong --  Host: Oh, yeah.  Kathy Bolt: -- then that's where you've got to focus on, you know, what happens if the launch does not go as expected and they need to immediately come home? They call it launch escapes, what happens at different points. It takes eight minutes, almost eight minutes to get up to orbit, at any point during that eight minutes there's a different potential sequence for where they're going to end up landing.  Host: Wow.  Kathy Bolt: And how do we train them for those type of things, how do we train them for issues if we can't dock the first time and we need to come back around and re-rendezvous and come back around and dock? So those are the types of things we're going to be focusing our training on going forward. And then just how do I operate this vehicle? So, there's a toilet in that vehicle, there's a galley in that vehicle, they need to know how to do that stuff in the tiny little capsules that they're going to be in versus the space station. And there will be up to four people in these capsules and so they need to know where everything is located and be able to take care of themselves, for the fires, for the emergencies that if that happens, too, so.  Host: Yeah, and that's a little different in the way that we do it because I guess for you you're here at the Johnson Space Center, here's the systems we use on the space station, it's ours and we get to play with it as we want, but this is working with other companies, so how has that been?  Kathy Bolt: Well, for the last year I've been privileged to go out and actually help SpaceX with their crew training.  Host: Oh, cool.  Kathy Bolt: NASA sent me out there just to kind of be a liaison and to guide them because they had not trained crews except for cargo missions, they hadn't trained, spent time training crews from beginning to end on how do I fly a vehicle and how do I learn everything about this vehicle, only how to open up a hatch and get the cargo out, you know?  Host: Yeah.  Kathy Bolt: And there's a big difference in that.  Host: Right.  Kathy Bolt: And so, I've had the privilege of going out there and just helping them figure out what a training flow should look like, what are the key things at least initially that we think we ought to train, what are the most important things from a crew perspective that they're going to want to know and want to have repetition on? But it's hard for our crews because they, most of this stuff is at the commercial company, you know, all of the mockups, most of them are at the commercial company. We do now have a few here at JSC where they can get some limited training here, but the majority will be offsite. And but when you think about the fact that they've been spending all this time going to Russia to learn Soyuz and they spend like almost half their year every year in training in Russia then going to California or doing it at least in the United States may be a little bit better.  Host: Yeah, so what are the things we have to start thinking about, thinking about commercial crew, thinking about space station, everything we've learned, what are some of the key elements we have to think about when things shift a little bit further from Earth and now we're thinking about Moon?  Kathy Bolt: Yeah, so to me the training will have to focus more on skills, generic skills, like the maintenance, the medical, just how do I troubleshoot things? Right now, we've gotten so dependent upon the ground being the ones that troubleshoot or fix the problems because we have constant comm with the ground unless something major happens that we've already talked about.  Host: And you mentioned the procedures to cover from an emergency are to get comm back --  Kathy Bolt: Are to get comm back, yeah.  Host: -- and rely on the ground, yeah.  Kathy Bolt: Exactly but going forward whether it's Moon or eventually to Mars you're not going to have that constant comm and the crew members are going to have to be more self-sufficient and be able to troubleshoot things on their own, so it's kind of, it's a very different mindset than where we've been for the last 20 some odd years. I think team skills is extremely important and the Astronaut Office has been focusing on that as well. Team skills are things like how do I take care of myself, but how do I take care of the team, you know?  Host: Yeah.  Kathy Bolt: It's focusing on both of those aspects and you never want someone who only thinks about themselves because you're going to be living in space, off the planet or in some Gateway, so for a long period of time with one or two or four, whatever number of people, and you've really got to know how to get along with people.  Host: Yeah, I wouldn't want to fly with that guy, right?  Kathy Bolt: Yeah, exactly, right.  Host: Just thinking about himself, yeah.  Kathy Bolt: Right, and so there's a lot of that I think expeditionary skills are what we call them because that's what you need for those long duration timeframes. But I can see us focusing more on instead of specifics of how do I operate an actual space station, how do I train my crews just to understand enough to be able to troubleshoot things and to do maintenance and to resolve issues, critical thinking.  Host: Wow.  Kathy Bolt: Things like that.  Host: Looking at your career here at NASA and training crews and everything that you've accomplished, all the crews that you've talked to, the people you've worked with, the lessons you've learned, what's a key takeaway from just the snapshot of your career, something that you want people to know or you think is a valuable lesson looking at your career?  Kathy Bolt: Well, I think the most important thing is that it is a team effort for everything that's done here at NASA and it's an international team. You know, we've got the people here and we've got folks that are in Russia and Europe and Japan and Canada and many other countries that are all a part of this team. And so, when we do something it's never an individual, it's never about the astronaut. They're the face and maybe the eyes and the hands, but they, it is a team effort, and that's what I think I see as, like I said earlier, just being privileged to be a part of that team and to sometimes be the voice for that team or to organize the path for that team when it comes to the training, that's been the highlights of my career.

Welcome to the official podcast of the NASA Johnson Space Center, Episode 138, “Captain and Commander,” I'm Gary Jordan and I'll be your host today. If you're new to the show, we bring in NASA experts to talk about all the different parts of our space agency. And sometimes we get lucky enough to bring in astronauts to talk about their story. So today we're going to talk with Chris Cassidy. He's a U.S. astronaut who's about to launch to the International Space Station this April 2020, for his third spaceflight. His first being on the space shuttle for STS-127 in 2009 that delivered the final components of the Japanese lab and finished its construction on the space station. And for Expeditions 35 and 36 for a long-duration mission. We talked about his education, studying math and ocean engineering. His experience in the U.S. military as a Navy SEAL. His previous spaceflight experience on the space shuttle and space station. And his expectations for this next long-duration stay where he'll serve as commander of the International Space Station. So, with no further delay, let's go light speed and jump right ahead to our talk with Captain Chris Cassidy. Enjoy.  [ Music ]  Host: Chris Cassidy, thanks so much for coming on the podcast with me today.  Chris Cassidy: Absolutely. Thanks.  Host: I really want to dive into your story, starting from the very beginning. I was looking for where you're from. I think you're like a lot of astronauts where you have a hometown, but you're not, you don't have one place where you were your whole life.  Chris Cassidy: I was born in Salem, Massachusetts. But when I was a young boy, we moved to Maine. And I spent all my formative years in York, Maine. So that's my, definitely my hometown.  Host: That is your hometown. What's York, Maine like? What do people not know about it?  Chris Cassidy: York, Maine is a kind of quiet seaside town not far up the coast from Boston. About an hour, hour and 15 minutes north of Boston. On the southern corner of Maine. Wintertime, not a huge population. In the summertime, a huge amount of tourists and vacationers. So, it was a great place to grow up. Plenty of work. I mowed lawns. I worked in restaurants and, in the summers. And then in the fall those people all left. School started. And you, it was small enough of a school, you could play any sport you wanted to all year round. Unlike bigger schools here in Texas where you kind of have to pick a sport and stick to it. But I enjoyed growing up in Maine very, very much.  Host: I feel like a lot of astronauts come from small towns. I think it's actually really interesting that you're from a small town in Maine. And then when you go up to the International Space Station, you'll be greeted by a fellow astronaut from Maine.  Chris Cassidy: Right.  Host: Jessica Meir. Caribou, Maine.  Chris Cassidy: Yep. We, she and I have talked quite a bit about it. We're excited to get up there. And I think we'll have some [Public Affairs Office] PAO events with different places around the state. But we're looking forward to it.  Host: Wonderful. Very much looking forward to that. Now, in terms of what interested you as a kid. Did you have particular interests or hobbies as a kid that may have inspired your career going forward?  Chris Cassidy: Nothing super out of the ordinary. I loved sports. And I was always doing some kind of sport thing as a kid. Whatever season it was, was my favorite sport. I played football. And basketball. And baseball. And a little bit of hockey I played when I was really young. So that just occupied most of my time. My brother and I, we both, think the same way. So, we were always throwing a ball around. And that sort of thing. I liked school, particularly math. But it wasn't anything that drove me. It was really sports that drove me.  Host: I know physical fitness is one of those key elements of your story. And we'll get to this later, you becoming a Navy SEAL. But you've also completed an Ironman Triathlon, which is, I looked it up. It's insane. I don't know how a person could do that. It seems like it's something that's very important in your life, physical fitness.  Chris Cassidy: Physical fitness is important for me. And I like a challenge too, you know. And I don't think I want to go run full distance Ironman Triathlons ever day or every week. But knowing that I could grind through one was very satisfying to me. And just being healthy and fit is important to me.  Host: Yeah. It seems like it's also this idea of maybe setting a goal and then really pushing yourself to meet that goal.  Chris Cassidy: Exactly.  Host: OK. Now, you said math was an interest to you. Was that something you were naturally good at? Or maybe something that was kind of like physical fitness where you're pushing yourself to truly understand it?  Chris Cassidy: No, I think I just kind of fell, like my brain is just wired that way for math. I always liked it. I always liked fidgeting with numbers or kind of calculating things. And later, when I got onto more advanced studies, applying those numbers to equations and trying to understand the world around me was something that I liked to dabble in. I never really enjoyed writing about those concepts. Writing was hard for me. In fact, I was a horrible speller. I still am a horrible speller. I rely very heavily on the little red squiggly line in Microsoft Word. But math was always something that came natural to me.  Host: So was, I know math, definitely this idea of a [Science, Technology, Engineering and Math] STEM field. Was space at all something you were interested in as a kid or maybe that came a little bit later?  Chris Cassidy: It definitely came later.  Host: OK.  Chris Cassidy: The only thing I recall even thinking about space was my sophomore year, I guess, in high school. Walking through the cafeteria and seeing the TV. Somebody had wheeled the TV in when the Challenger explosion happened. And I remember seeing that and stopping like everybody else in the cafeteria and watching and thinking about it. And, but I could not tell you who an astronaut was at that time. I couldn't have told you when the next shuttle was going. I couldn't even have named what the names of the shuttles were. It was not anything on my radar screen, space. And then it wasn't until a little bit later, I was in any my Navy career when I learned about it. I met Bill Shepherd. And understood what it meant to be an astronaut, at least what I thought at the time.  Host: Yeah.  Chris Cassidy: And understood the process on how to become one. That I got a little motivated to try.  Host: Interesting. So, I know, I mean, you mentioned military. Was that something that was maybe something that was of interest to you in your earlier childhood career or high school?  Chris Cassidy: So, when I was in high school, we didn't have the Internet. And we had these books in the guidance counselor's office that were really thick, like these encyclopedias of colleges. And you, I remember you take in your free time, and you'd go down there, and you'd flip through these 800,000-page books on all the colleges in the country. And I got to the page of the Naval Academy. And I was really captivated by the buildings and the people in uniform. And just how it looked. And the whole thing looked appealing to me. And I sent away for a brochure. I got more information about it. And in reading all that I could consume, I was, just felt like, wow, this is a place for me. I can see myself there. I'm super excited to go there. And I want to do that. And this was, and then I read even more. And it said you don't have to pay anything to come here. You just have to pay in service to your nation. Which I didn't even know what that meant. But I was fine with it. Whatever that pay with service to your nation meant, I was cool with it. And so that set me off on the path to try to get to the Naval Academy. It's a whole other story on how I ended up arriving there. But that was a critical point for me when I realized that.  Host: Yeah.  Chris Cassidy: That's where I wanted to attend college.  Host: Well, let's dive into that story of you actually pursuing the Naval Academy. It seems like something about it piqued your interest. But your pursuit of it is quite interesting.  Chris Cassidy: Yeah. The academy has a really good support network once you tap into it. And all service academies. I'm familiar with the Naval Academy. But the other service academies are the same. Where they, you can have what the Navy calls a blue and gold officer. Which is an alumni who can help you with the process. And the process is kind of twofold. You have to get, apply to the academy itself just like a college. And be accepted to the service academy. And you also have to have a congressional or a nomination from your senator or congressman. And that was the part that I learned about, and I pursued and was able to get. But unbeknownst to me, and the guidance I got from the congressional staff office was. We send everything for you to the Naval Academy. You don't have to do a thing. It's all handled from here. \"Here\" being their office. And I, me, 18-year-old guy. And I see a person of authority telling me something. And they seem like very sure. So, I just believed it. And a few months later, when I anticipated, and my other high school classmates were getting answers back from colleges. And I was getting answers from other colleges, not the Naval Academy. That I didn't hear anything from them. And so, I made a phone call. Found out that there was no paperwork on me in their file system. They didn't even know who I was. Didn't have my social security number or anything. And I went there with my friend who was, his dad was going from Maine to Washington. Which is like an eight or nine-hour drive. And he was going for a business trip. And my friend and I accompanied his father. And from Washington, D.C., I drove over to Annapolis about an hour away. And went to the admissions office. And I got put in front of one of the admissions counselors there. It was a Marine Corps officer. And he told me that, he listened to my story and kind of nodded a little bit. And said, “OK, I'll get back to you.” And then later that next week, when I was back in school, I got a phone call where it was him on the line. And said, “I can get you into the Naval Academy Prep School. Are you interested in going?” And I said, “absolutely, yes, sir. Sign me up.” And that's how I ended up at the Navy Prep School. Which is a one-year program, mostly for recruited athletes. I wasn't a recruited athlete or somebody that they see potential in that they want to get a little more academic preparation on. And it was a perfect situation for me. I was young, 18-year-old guy. I went there. Had one year of the military environment as well as the academic environment. And then because, when I got to my freshman year at Navy, all of those things were already part of me. I wasn't learning the military system at the same time I was learning how to be a student. And so, it just came very natural. And that allowed me to be very successful my first year. And I continued that success through the four years there. So, if that Marine Corps officer had not had believed in me and given me the chance, I wouldn't have ended up at the Naval Academy. Which would have, a cycle of things that wouldn't have happened to, including you and I sitting here for this interview about a spaceflight.  Host: That's right. And it seems like it was partially, yes, his work and his effort to actually get you in. But it was a little bit of your relentless pursuit. You went from not even having an application and no one even knowing you who were to driving down and going face-to-face. And saying, hey, “I really want this. This is something that's very important to me.”  Chris Cassidy: And I think that's, I don't know if I learned that. Or if it's just part of me. But is to always think about, OK, well, it doesn't matter how I got here. But these are the circumstances that I'm in. How do I, what's the solution? What's the path forward? Make incremental baby steps in getting to where you want to go. And each time re-collect the information. And get, talk to more people. And just kind of pursue things that way. Ultimately, nobody has more interest in your success than you do. And I think that was one of the lessons I learned through that whole process.  Host: Wonderful. Now, you said you had a head start when it came to the Naval Academy because of the prep school. So, you kind of knew the way of the land. And this is where you were studying math?  Chris Cassidy: I was a math major.  Host: You were a math major.  Chris Cassidy: Yeah.  Host: OK. And what -- where did it lead to your career next?  Chris Cassidy: So, all the service academies, you, after you spend your four years in academic environment, you then get a commission in whatever service you are. For me it was the Navy. And within the Navy you can do lots of different things. You can be on a ship. You can be on a submarine. You can fly airplanes. You can be a Seabee. A supply officer. A [Sea, Air and Land] SEAL. An explosive ordinance. There's like lots and lots of different communities in the Navy. I was intrigued by the SEAL teams just by some of the mentors that were stationed at the Naval Academy. In high school I had no idea what a SEAL was. Totally different time than now. Like now, you can't watch a news talk show without some former special forces person who has their opinion. Or books all over the place about SEALs. And every raid that has happened has somebody writing about it. Completely different time in the 1980s. You know, it wasn't anything that anybody knew about, including myself. So, when I arrived in Annapolis is when I first saw, when I, a SEAL. And I learned what they do. And I thought, oh, I like the water. I like to do physical stuff. It sounds kind of cool. Maybe I can do it. And so that's what led me to the SEAL training.  Host: What I like about your story so far is a lot of these key pivotal moments in your story leading up to, and we're just getting into the SEAL part. It seems like a lot of people start with dreams or just something they read or something they see. And they actively pursue it. It seems like you get to a point where you're looking forward to, what should I do next? And then some opportunity or something comes up. Like, for example, you said SEAL mentors. Maybe someone you talked to. You didn't know where you're going in this Naval Academy. But you maybe talked to just the right person that influenced your career. And you say, that's it. That's what I'm doing now. And you pursue that going forward. I like that about your story. It seems like it's these, it's not so much a well-planned out thing or pursuing a dream. It's just your jumping on opportunities.  Chris Cassidy: And figuring out what's required to get to the next step. And say, OK, I'll do those couple things and see if the opportunity's still there. But at least let other people tell me no instead of me telling me no.  Host: Yeah. So what qualities and what about you had to change? Or what did you learn in your time as a Navy SEAL?  Chris Cassidy: Learned lots of things. I learned, first and foremost, that difficult situations are not accomplished by individuals. They're accomplished by teamwork. Camaraderie. Group grit. And equally so that negativity in that teamwork is not helpful. Not a whole lot of examples of that in my time in the SEAL teams. But I can remember a few times where some, in SEAL training where somebody got down. And they can, you can feel the momentum bringing everybody down. This, we're talking right now on a Monday and just the last couple days was a NFL playoff football. And they have the thing called momentum in sports. And you can tell when a negative play happens. A blocked punt or an intersection. It swings, and it just kind of gets this wave of negative momentum on that team. And the other guys capitalize on it. And I think the same thing is true in small units. Where, or even just business or whatever. Somebody can bring, swing the momentum in a negative way. Or you're on a space mission, and you get the phone call that you have to stay an extra three weeks. And that's a momentum shift. And the mark, one of the things I learned in the SEAL teams is the mark of a really good leadership and a good team is you can overcome those just with everybody jumping on it. And one of the guys in my SEAL platoon used to say, this is a blank sandwich. And we all got to take a bite of it, you know. Let's share, distribute it amongst all of us, and it won't be so bad.  Host: Yeah. And it sounds like a very powerful thing that is required to overcome. Because you said just negativity, you know, we talk about it a lot just in our own lives. But when you're talking about a team having to accomplish a mission or a goal, having negativity swing the course of, you said even in a football game. That could swing the course, the shift of a football game. And then next thing you know, the enemy, the opposing team is taking advantage of that. Really important to keep away that negativity. I'm sure, and we can talk about this later whenever we get to some of your spaceflight experience. It's something that you've taken with you going forward.  Chris Cassidy: Yeah. I mean, all of us as astronauts, we strive to not be the ones that cause the mission to not go well. In other words, we don't want to make mistakes. We don't want to make errors. We want to execute the plan that the team delivers to us. But we're all human. Astronauts too. And we make mistakes. And any one of us on a mission has made a mistake. Maybe minor. Maybe you put the, your blood sample in the wrong drawer of the freezer. And then three months later to go get it, you can't find your blood because it's in the opposite freezer. Or maybe it's bigger. Where you open the valve to space, and you start dumping out air. And you lose some air. I mean, don't want to think about the ones that are harmful to people. But we don't want to make any of those mistakes. And when you make them, you have to just forget about it in a way. You know, you don't want to totally forget so that you make the same one. But you can't dwell on it. You got to move forward and, darn it. That's about as far as you can go. And then move on. And just not make any more.  Host: That's right. Learn from it. That's kind of what you're saying.  Chris Cassidy: Yeah.  Host: Is not to dwell on it. But to look at, OK, now, kind of like what you were saying. This is my situation now.  Chris Cassidy: Yeah.  Host: What can I do to fix it going forward?  Chris Cassidy: What can I go forward with, yeah.  Host: Yeah. So, we talked about your experience and lessons learned from being on the SEAL team. What was next for you after SEAL?  Chris Cassidy: During one of my SEAL deployments, I had an application pending to be an astronaut. Actually, back up one real quickly. I had applied previous time, which was, would have been for the astronaut class of 2000. And I did not get selected. I did not get an interview. In hindsight, I was in graduate school, but I didn't have a graduate degree. And I had less leadership experience in the SEAL team. Four years later, which was the class I was selected in, 2004, I had completed a master’s degree. I more leadership experience. And it was after September 11th. So, the nation was in that conflict. And I'd been part of it. So, I think that was all, that all contributed to me being a more well-rounded applicant. So that was the next thing. And I was, I -- the astronaut interview process is long. I had my interview in Houston in September. And the next week I left for a six-month deployment to Afghanistan. So, the whole time I was in Afghanistan, I was wondering what was the status of my application. And it's not like a, there's no website that says you're this far along in the process. Or your application is now being reviewed by the chief astronaut. That doesn't happen. So, you kind of don't know where you stand in the process. But I had told the selection office that I was really unreachable by phone in a reliable way. So, if you needed to talk to me, send me an e-mail for a day or two later to talk, to give you a call. And I will call. And so, I received such an e-mail from this guy, gentleman named Duane Ross who was the selection committee chair. And he said, call the office at, on Monday at noon or whatever. Well, it just so happened that that weekend was the end of our six-month deployment. And I had arrived back in my house in Norfolk, Virginia. And, so I was actually called from my home in Virginia on that appointed time while I was going to call. And the clock was ticking 11:57, 11:58. And then the phone rang. And it was a Houston telephone number. And I answered. And it was Kent Rominger, who was the chief astronaut at the time, asking me if I wanted to be an astronaut. So that was a super cool time. Super cool phone call. I'll never forget it. And another one of those things where it sets your life in a different path.  Host: Wow. It seems like, wait, so going back, taking a step back. It seems like astronaut became very much a possibility while were you still a SEAL?  Chris Cassidy: It did. And, like I said, I had that interview. Heard nothing. Except for maybe in the fall, late fall, closer to Christmas or whatever of that year, September was my interview. The FBI came knocking on the door of the little old lady who lived next door to us. And we didn't know this, but then a week later the FBI -- the little old lady came out as my wife was mowing the lawn. And she came up to her and said, “the FBI was here asking questions about Chris' background.” And that was a clue, the very first clue that I had made it kind of farther along in the process. That NASA was interested in me enough to spend the resources to have an interview. And, so, yeah, that was the first clue I had that there was a hope.  Host: Wow. So, what made you want to pursue sending your application in the first place?  Chris Cassidy: It was really nothing that I felt like I wouldn't be a complete person if I didn't get selected as an astronaut. I was very happy in my job in the SEAL teams. I loved it. And, but I remember thinking, oh, that would be super cool. I would really enjoy going to space. I mean, of course, there's whole lot more to the job as an astronaut. But you don't know that when you're applying. You just see people in a spacesuit, riding a rocket or going to an doing an EVA. I thought that would be really awesome. I would love to do that. Why don't I try. And that's, and, again, I mentioned it earlier in this podcast. I had met Bill Shepherd. And remember thinking to myself, he went to the Naval Academy and went to MIT, and so have I. So maybe this is something that's of interest to NASA. And so why don't I try. And that's all it was. Why don't I try. See where it gets, see where it leads.  Host: Another moment in your story of --  Chris Cassidy: Yeah.  Host: -- Finding an opportunity and capitalizing on it. So, you got that wonderful call in Norfolk, Virginia. Talk about coming to NASA. Some of your first days. First impressions. It was a little bit different from being a Navy SEAL, I'm assuming.  Chris Cassidy: Yep. Ironically, I was, in the Navy, you move every couple of years. You change your duty stations. And I was set to move that summer anyway. So, it was really a matter of if our household goods were being shipped to California or somewhere else. And we revectored the household goods to Houston. And it showed up here. I remember, it's kind of funny. My son was little. He was maybe five or six years old. And I came home on like the second day of work. And he came running up to me and said, “Dad, did you go to the Moon today?” And it just made me laugh so hard because he was so sincere. And thought that, maybe that was a chance that I could have gone to the Moon on a Tuesday. But I was really just getting my badge and finding out where the bathroom is and all that kind of stuff.  Host: I like that. [Laughter]  Chris Cassidy: Yeah.  Host: Not today, maybe tomorrow. [Laughter]  Chris Cassidy: Not today, maybe check with me on Thursday.  Host: All right. So, let's go to, let's jump ahead to your first spaceflight. I know you flew in 2009 on STS-127 on the space shuttle. Was what was that like?  Chris Cassidy: So that was my first mission. And it's different. You know, each mission, as you gain more experience, is different. The first one you are kind of wide-eyed and taking it all in. And every single class, you don't know, is this the most important thing I'm being told? Or is this something I don't really have to put in the forefront of my memory? And you're just soaking it all in the whole training process. You rely heavily on the experienced people. And I was all of that. Nothing drastically sticks out from my preparation, in my memory about the preparation. Other than we had five spacewalks on our mission. So, we spent quite a bit of timeout at the [Neutral Buoyancy Laboratory] NBL as a crew. We, our crew has the dubious honor of, I believe, having the most launch delays or tied or something. We did not launch until the sixth attempt.  Host: Wow.  Chris Cassidy: And, which sounds, it's hard to appreciate what that means just sitting here talking over this podcast. But think about six days thinking that you're waking up and you're going to go to bed that night in space. And it not happening. And what that means to your launch guests. You know, they're all there. You have 250 launch guests at the beginning. By the time I launched, I think I had 11. Everybody had to go onto their normal lives and back to work or whatever. So that part was all part of the process. And then the mission was a whirlwind, two weeks of a space shuttle goes by so fast. You're busy, busy, busy, busy. And then you go to bed. And you get up, and you do it all again. Before you know it, it's halfway through. Before you know it, you're landing. And then somebody puts together a video of what you did. And you go tell people about it. And you watch the video and go, oh, yeah. I guess I was there. I don't remember that, but I guess I was there because you got me on video. But just a fun experience. Great crew. Great crewmates. Great friends. I think our, when we arrived, we were the first time that 13 people had been on the space station. There was a crew of six and then we brought our seven from the shuttle. So just neat times.  Host: Yeah, sounds crowded.  Chris Cassidy: It was.  Host: So how does that differ from your next spaceflight? Which was long-duration on the space station with a few less people.  Chris Cassidy: Yeah. So, we were still, so on my next mission, I flew on a Soyuz, three-person crew. I had two cosmonaut crewmates. Pavel Vinogradov. Sasha Misurkin. A shuttle launch, all the preparation is here in Houston. You travel to Florida a few times. But, in general, you're always in Houston for training. And you have seven people. You're all reading American-made checklists in English. And talking to people in Houston. On the Soyuz, the checklists were all in Russian. It's a very small capsule. And we're talking Russian inside the capsule. And we're speaking on the radio to the Russian flight control team. And so, all of those things were drastically different. I was the lead of the U.S. side of the space station. So, I felt a lot more, a great deal more of responsibility of maintaining and running the space station. And when I arrived, Tom Marshburn and Chris Hadfield were there. And I could lean on their experience. Because they were on the tail end of their six months when I got there. And I relied on their experience to get me up to speed. But that was only for, I forget, seven weeks or something like that. At most two months. And then they left. And those duties fell on me. And I remember feeling a lot of satisfaction. Like, wow, I understand this space station. I really can hear the noises and understand if it's a good noise or a funny noise. And I liked it a lot. And then Karen and Luca arrived. And, together as a crew, we got them up to speed. And then, and the three of us, I think, did a pretty satisfying job. Or at least we felt we did for the rest of the mission. So, the short answer to your question is, the shuttle, I felt, I was the new guy. And wide-eyed and listening to others. My next mission I felt this sense of pride that I was in a position to understand all of the space station.  Host: Do you feel like because of that experience, particularly this last one of feeling that sense of experience. Do you feel even more ready now going into this next one?  Chris Cassidy: This next one's even more different. Like I've come off of a couple years in management position as the chief astronaut. And now I've been in training again for the last few years. And the space station is, runs really well. And does a lot of science now. Even more than we did back seven years ago. So, I'm excited to experience what it's like to just almost all be about science and research. So, yeah, every mission's different. Because you're different. Your crew complement it different. The tasks that you do are different. So, it will just be a different experience.  Host: Along the lines of different experiences, I know you've had different roles on the ground here at NASA. One of them being the chief of the astronaut office. Can you tell me about what you learned from maybe some of the other chief astronauts? And what you, what values you put forward when you were chief?  Chris Cassidy: So, I took over from, as chief from Bob Behnken. And he took over from Peggy Whitson. And Peggy was in training to fly on her last flight. And Bob left the office to begin preparation for commercial crew. So, when I became chief, I had two former chiefs that \"worked\" for me. Which is quite different. In the military, where my background is, if the commanding officer turns over to the new commanding officer, the old one leaves and goes to some other job. It would be unheard of. It just wouldn't happen for the old commanding officer to just fold back and be a member of the ranks in the unit.  Host: Interesting.  Chris Cassidy: So, it was not something that I was used to. But I realized that we have a mature group of people in the astronaut office. And the ego is not there to feel like, oh, you can't boss. You're not the boss of me kind of thing. Not at all. It's very helpful. Everybody's out to make the office better. And I was really lucky to have Peggy and Bob working together with me. And there's, it's kind of cool that there's a good chance that I could be in space with Bob. And he and Doug Hurley are going to be on the test flight of Space X. Interesting side note. My first flight was with Doug Hurley on the shuttle. My second flight was with Karen Nyberg. Of course, they're husband and wife. And now my third flight could be with Doug again. So, I was joking with them recently about it's, we alternate. I alternate members of their family that I fly in space with. And it's Doug's turn now.  Host: Yeah. You say every spaceflight's different as you were going through all of your spaceflight experience. And you say this next one coming up is probably going to be different. That's one of the key different elements right there. Is now we're talking about, you talked about training in Houston for the shuttle. You talk about training in Houston with, everything was in English. And, you know, you're local to the United States. You have to do, you have to go to Russia to launch on the Soyuz. Tell me about what this means for commercial crew? You say you might even see some of your crewmates up on the space station launching on American vehicles. It's a little bit different this time. What does that mean to you?  Chris Cassidy: The whole commercial crew thing? Before I dive into that. Real quick, I also.  Host: Oh, yeah.  Chris Cassidy: I've never been in space without Tom Marshburn. So, I won't know what to do without waking up and seeing.  Host: That's true he was on shuttle and saw him on 35.  Chris Cassidy: He was on shuttle. Yeah, exactly. So, but in all seriousness to answer your question. The commercial crew thing I think is just an exciting time for our nation. You know, we're not launching people from Florida right now. And we soon will be. That's the bottom line. And we've got, whether it's a commercial company or a company that has a contract from NASA to build it. To me, that's all interesting. But the bottom line is a rocket with an American flag is going to launch from the coast of Florida.  Host: Yeah.  Chris Cassidy: That's what I'm excited about.  Host: Very cool.  Chris Cassidy: And my colleagues are going to get in it and ride to the space station. And I'm going to see them.  Host: That's awesome. Now, is there anything looking forward to this mission that you'd maybe like to do differently? Or make sure you capitalize on? Maybe something that, you know, you were in space for a long time in this last long-duration spaceflight. But is there something that maybe you didn't get to that you'd like to do this time around?  Chris Cassidy: I have no real special projects. I -- you never know when it could be your last mission. I don't know what is in store for me after the flight. Whether I'll still be at NASA or not. I mean, I think I will be. But you never know. And, therefore, you never know if you're going to see that window out of the Cupola again. When, on my first mission, I just assumed that I would go to space again. And my second mission, I was pretty sure I wasn't going anywhere. But, and I was pretty sure that there would be another opportunity to get to space. Now I'm 50 years old. It's taken, it was 2009 to '13. So, it's four years between my first and second. It's been seven between my second and third. I don't know if I have the time and, or the health. You never know if something's going to prevent you from flying in space. So that's a long way of saying, I'm just going to really enjoy being there. And looking out the window. And seeing our magnificent planet through the Cupola windows. And taking pictures of the Earth. Taking pictures of the places that I've been to. Taking pictures of the places that I want to go to. And calling friends and family from space. For some reason people get a kick out of getting a phone call from space. I have, the phone numbers stored on my phone as International Space Station. So, because, maybe it's because my time as chief when it was, I regularly spoke to the space station. It's not something I get excited about anymore. But I'm excited to share that enthusiasm with others.  Host: Yeah, yeah. That's so funny that you think it's a normal thing. Oh, man. I would be so excited if I got that phone call. So along that theme, along, you know, you're thinking about, I don't know what the future holds. This might be my last spaceflight. I'm going to enjoy it. Thinking about generations of astronauts coming after you. Just at the time of this recording, we just had a graduation event. And had all these new class of astronauts come in that are looking forward to all kinds of exciting things. Commercial crew being one of them. We talked about Artemis during this event, going to the Moon. There's a lot to look forward to. But in your experience, you being an experienced astronaut. What would you like to say to those astronauts and to generations of astronauts coming after that? Some kind of value or lesson to take away from this in your experience?  Chris Cassidy: Yeah, that's a good question. Because there's lots of aspects I could talk about.  Host: Yeah.  Chris Cassidy: Like the training. The PAO aspect of it. The operational part. You know, what are you going to do? It's very, it's easy in this job to think that you're just doing the job for ourselves. And it's taken me a lot of maturity to realize that we are doing this job for our country. And we are doing this job for other people. And it's not about us. It's not about us as individuals or even as a collective group of astronauts. It's about what our country is doing. And we're a member of the team that pulls off a really cool mission for our country. And so, to all of those that are new and that are not yet astronauts that will be, it's just keep that in mind. You know, you're excited to come here. Excited to put on a spacesuit. Get in a pool. Put on a spacesuit. Get on a rocket. Walk around on some dusty place. But, ultimately, it's about being a member of the United States of America. Being a member of an international group of countries that are doing the mission. And doing things that make the world better.  Host: It's an amazing lesson. Chris Cassidy, I really appreciate your time today for coming on the podcast. And best of luck on your next mission.  Chris Cassidy: Thanks a lot, Gary, appreciate it.  [ Music ]  Host: Hey, thanks for sticking around.

                        "description": "Gary Jordan (Host): Houston, we have a podcast. Welcome to the official podcast of the NASA Johnson Space Center, Episode 139, “Apollo 13.” I'm Gary Jordan; I'll be your host today. On this podcast, we bring in the experts, scientists, engineers, astronauts, all to let you know what's going on in the world of human spaceflight. On April 13, 1970, roughly 200,000 miles away from Earth, John or \"Jack\" Swigert, Fred Haise, and James or \"Jim\" Lovell, the crew members of Apollo 13 had just wrapped up a TV broadcast before turning it in for the night. Nine minutes later, after Swigert flipped one switch for a routine churn of the liquid oxygen tanks, oxygen tank number two exploded, which led to a chain reaction that left the crew in a dire situation. \"Houston, we've had a problem,\" rings over the audio loops.  Capcom: Say again, please?  Apollo 13 (Lovell): Houston, we've had a problem.  Host: To set the stage, here's what Houston and the crew were up against. On the Apollo spacecraft, there were three main areas that ended up playing much different roles after the blast. The service module, the command module, and the lunar module. The service module was stocked with the oxygen, water, and power needed for the mission. However, it also housed the main propulsion and maneuvering systems for the spacecraft. When the oxygen tank exploded, the crew lost these consumables, and the service module was rendered non-functional. The command module was the control center, and served as the crew compartment, accommodating all three astronauts. This module was also designed for re-entry and was equipped with enough power and consumables only for the crew's descent back into Earth's atmosphere. However, the command module had to be powered down to avoid depleting its systems. If it hadn't been, then it would have been impossible for the crew to perform the re-entry operations to return to Earth. The lunar module was designed to make a landing on the Moon, while providing a home base on the lunar surface, and was designed for only two astronauts. However, it ultimately ended up being a lifeboat for all three of them on this mission. It allowed the crew to save the command module supplies for re-entry because it had its own systems for power and consumables. Also, with the service module inoperable, the descent engine on the lunar module was the only way to provide propulsion to perform the maneuvers needed to set up the spacecraft's trajectory enough so the crew could get home. On top of that, it was extremely cold, drinking water and food were scarce, the condensation began to build up inside the spacecraft. Yet against all these odds, over the course of the next four days, the crew members and the ground support team tirelessly worked together, and Swigert, Haise, and Lovell were safely brought back home on April 17th, 1970. And it was because of the experience gained in rescuing the crew that the Apollo 13 mission was considered a successful failure. It's after this famous phrase, \"Houston, we've had a problem,\" where in the face of adversity, it was the perseverance, intelligence, and guardianship of the flight controllers and engineers here in Houston, and the bravery of the Apollo 13 crew, that made for a legendary trip back to Earth. It's after this incredible journey for which this podcast, “Houston We Have a Podcast,” is named. So today, commemorating the 50th anniversary of the Apollo 13 mission and the human ingenuity and spirit that brought the crew home safe, we sit down with Fred Haise and Jim Lovell. Enjoy.  [ Music ]  Host: Fred and Jim, thank you so much for coming on Houston We Have A Podcast today.  Fred Haise: Glad to be here, glad to be here. Glad to join you.  Host: [laughs] So this April marks the 50th anniversary of Apollo 13, that's the mission we're going to be talking about today. That's an incredible amount of time. Does it feel like 50 years have gone by? Fred, we'll start with you.  Fred Haise: Well at times it does, but now I'm getting at an age right now I realize a lot of time has gone by. But of course, over the years, Jim and I have got to talk about it a lot. Many, many events over the years.  Host: That's right. Yeah. And I'm sure that more coming up now with the 50th anniversary. Jim, what about you? Does it feel like 50 years?  Jim Lovell: It does. It's a long time now since that flight occurred. But I keep thinking about it, and of course, this year, I've been getting a lot of telephone calls regarding it.  Host: I'm sure! Have you seen each other, you and Fred, recently? Just through all of the-- I guess all of these requests that have been coming down, I'm sure you're very busy around this time.  Jim Lovell: Yes. I don't think we have. When was the last time we saw each other, Fred?  Fred Haise: It was at some event. I mean, yes that's when we normally get together, with ourselves and other comrades as well, for several Apollo-- like Apollo 11 events that were recently held, for Apollo 11.  Host: OK. Yes. So, events-- yes around some of these anniversaries.  Fred Haise: Exactly.  Host: Gentlemen, you're both aviators, military men. You-- after NASA, you became corporate executives. Taking a snapshot right now, 50 years after Apollo 13, tell me about some of your proudest moments in your career, and just highlights now that we're 50 years past this mark. Jim, we'll start with you.  Jim Lovell: Well, of course the proudest moments for me was my tenure in the NASA program, and flying, what, four flights, especially Apollo 8, and then of course the-- probability of not coming back on 13 and working carefully with Mission Control to make this a successful failure.  Host: Fred, what about you?  Fred Haise: Well, I think Jim and I were both naval aviators. Now he was a Navy guy, and I was a Marine guy. But other than that, we both wore the wings of gold. No, my NASA career included a couple of backups before 13. I backed up Bill Anders on Apollo 8, which Jim flew. And I backed up Buzz Aldrin on Apollo 11, with Jim. We were the backup crew on that one and flew 13. And then I backed up John Young on 16. With Grumman-- with Grumman I started and ended up at Northrop Grumman for 17 years. I guess the two things I'm proud of is two contracts I had, major contracts, were shuttle processing contracts. So, I was involved in turning around space shuttles to go fly again for 12 years.  Host: How about that?  Fred Haise: And the second one was the system engineering integration contract I ran on early Space Station, Freedom. So, it's the beginnings of the [International Space Station] ISS. It was a different shape and form when we were doing it, but that's what ended up being ISS.  Host: [laughs] Well, let's zoom back 50 years to this mission, Apollo 13. I want to start with the launch. Jim, you were no stranger to the Saturn 5, this gigantic rocket launching on Apollo 8 first. Can you tell me about your experience that second time launching for Apollo 13?  Jim Lovell: Well, Saturn 5 was like old hams to me, because of Apollo 8. But it was an old man's rocket compared to the Titan that we flew on Gemini. It was not hard at all. It was a slow buildup on G loading, and then finally it went to various stages working. And I rather enjoyed it.  Host: Oh really? Fred, now what about you?  Fred Haise: Well, the most unusual thing to me of the G's or motion was, it was kind of herky-jerky when the engines gimbaled. And the kind of motion, particularly sideways motion you felt was unusual from airplane-- and you don't see it in turbulence or anything. Otherwise, like Jim said, the G's were fairly modest. I think the peak was four and a half. And we had both flown fighters, even in our older fighters, you could pull 6, 7 G's, in combat maneuvering. So, you know that wasn't that big a deal compared to our airplane experience.  Host: Yes. I can see why Jim called it an old man's rocket. Yes, it was just-- it was different. It wasn't as intense as maybe people think, looking at this gigantic rocket, that makes so much noise. Now after launch, it seems like things are going pretty normal, of course, until it's time to stir the tank. And then you hear this-- hear and feel, this explosion. Fred, can you tell me about your first thoughts when this event occurred?  Fred Haise: Well, I mean we heard the bang, and you know, it rang through this metallic structure. We're in metal vehicles. And of course, the first thing is, what was it? What was it? And at the time, I got to the-- left the lunar module where I was putting away equipment we had out to do a show and tell TV show. I was still putting things away, by the time I drifted up to my position in the right couch, which had a lot of the cryogenics and the fuel cells, and all of that, I looked and saw one oxygen, two oxygen instruments on Tank 2 in the bottoms, both pressure and quantity. And I knew we had lost one oxygen tank, almost for sure, because it's two different kind of sensors that would feed those dials. And so, I knew we had lost a tank, and I knew we had-- that would constitute an abort. So, I was sick to my stomach with disappointment, because I knew pretty quick we had an aborted mission, and we weren't going to get to land on the Moon.  Host: Jim, did you have the same feeling, the same thought process that led you to “Oh no, we're going to have to abort and not land on the Moon?”  Jim Lovell: It's about the same as Fred. I was just going down into the command module when the explosion occurred. I looked up at Fred to see if he knew what caused the noise, and I could tell from his expression that he didn't know at the time, and then I looked down at Jack, and I noticed that he-- his face was such that he was wondering what was going on. And then of course, when I got down into the command module, I saw the warning light was on, and we had lost a fuel cell to begin with. But the conclusion was that I drifted over to the window and looked out the window. I can't tell you now why I did it, but when I did, I saw escaping at a high rate of speed a gaseous substance from the back of our spacecraft, and it dawned on me that yes, we had lost something. And then I looked at the oxygen gauges, and one read zero, and the other one was going down, so that-- you know, it said that everything for us, that this was a real problem.  Host: Were you thinking maybe there's a way to fix this, and we can land on the Moon? Or did you truly think, yeah, I think we're going to have to abort this?  Jim Lovell: Well, I knew that this was not going to be landing at this time. And I think even when I saw the gas leaving, I knew that this was going to be a trial, to try to get back to Earth.  Host: Yeah. Now you know, you went through a lot of training on the ground, first, to get to this moment, and Jim, you even had an experience flying to the Moon, so there was a lot of experience just in that mission. But how did the training and what you thought could happen, and training for different scenarios, how did that compare to this actual scenario?  Jim Lovell: Well, as far as I'm concerned, this was all-- something entirely new. Done a lot of training, and we had thought about using the lunar module in previous works that we had done, but the situation that put us in was one which was, you know, new to us at the time. And it was new to everybody as a matter of fact. And therefore, we had to figure out what exactly went wrong, what do we have to work with, and fortunately we had communications with mission control, and that's how the things got started.  Host: Fred, now what was some of the more important, or more useful parts of your training that prepared you to deal with this problem?  Fred Haise: Oh, I don't think you can say it's a useful part. All the training was done in what we call simulations, where we were tied to mission control from simulators at Kennedy. And there was actually a group that worked behind the scenes, [Simulation Supervisor] SimSup, that worked very diligently to try to prepare a set of failures that only they knew to trick us, to make us and mission control look bad. So, we went through-- I'd been through-- Jim too, through several missions before.  Host: Yes.  Fred Haise: With several thousands of hours of this kind of training. So-- but this, as Jim said, this was a unique problem. It had not been considered-- it had been considered, but if you had an explosion, if you looked at the mean effects analysis on explosions, they're mainly considered for rocket engines. But nevertheless, the answer was you lose the vehicle and the crew. And so obviously for this condition, there was no Plan B ready. And I think Jack Lousma, capped it-- well at one point when things settled a little bit-- Jack Lousma was Capcom and he said, “man this is a heck of a sim.”  Host: [laughs] Well, so you mention in the sim, you know, you mentioned they're trying to trick us. They want-- I think they want you to think through some problems. But in the event of a real-life contingency, tell me about the working with the flight controllers to solve the problem together. You know, thinking about what can I solve, and then what can we rely on our smart group of flight controllers and engineers on the ground to help solve, and balancing that?   Jim Lovell: Well of course it was one of cooperation between both mission control and ourselves, but you have to kind of look at the synopsis of this particular flight. If you were superstitious, this was the perfect flight to look at, 13 being the name of the spacecraft. You know, we'd had before the flight, we had the threat of measles. We lost the engine on the second stage of-- during the boost phase, and now the explosion occurred. But the explosion occurred at just the right time to make sure that we could-- or to get our return safely. If the explosion occurred, and we'd already gotten to the high velocity to go to the Moon, we'd probably have had to go around the Moon to come back home again, and I don't think the lunar module would have had the electrical capacity to get us home. If the explosion occurred once we were in lunar orbit, or you know, around the lunar surface, well then, we would have been stranded at the Moon.  Host: Yes. Fred, did you have sort of the same thoughts, that this happened at just the right time, or maybe you had some doubts that maybe, oh you know, maybe something else could go wrong?  Fred Haise: No, I didn't think about the right time or wrong time. To me it was the wrong time to have a problem, but-- no that came to me some time later.  Host: Yes.  Fred Haise: Yes.  Host: Now I know, on the ground, there was this-- you know, to think about questions to ask you, I did go back, and I watched the movie, “Apollo 13,” fantastic. And I know there was this thought of should we do a direct abort? Should we go right back home? Or should we circle around the Moon, and then there were just a lot of unknowns. And it was all happening on the ground. You were up in Odyssey, and then in Aquarius, just sort of waiting for the direction. Did you have a sense of some of these decisions that were happening on the ground, and considerations? Jim, I'll start with you.  Jim Lovell: Well, yes, we'd thought of various things what to do with what we had onboard and can do to get home. The first thing that the ground said, and I think they were right, we got to get back on the free-returning course. We had changed our course, because they had thought that it-- when we got to the Moon and we started descent, we would probably have the sun overhead, and the Moon surface would be wiped out. And so, we changed our course to another course that we had to get back on that course. So that was the first thing that we had to do, once we powered up the lunar module.  Host: Yeah. Now after this event, you know, you're working through the problems, and you're going back around the Moon, because the goal now, the new mission is, we have to return home safely. So, you know, you throw out the old flight plan. Now you're sort of dealing with this. Was there a lot of waiting, a lot of boredom in-between some of these key phases at this point? And if so, what were you guys talking about? Fred, we'll start with you.  Fred Haise: Well yes. We had times, like Jim mentioned, we did that maneuver, and we had coasting time to get around to the back side of the Moon, where shortly two hours after that low point around the back side, we did another maneuver. So, there was some-- we don't want to call it relaxed time. It wasn't very relaxed.  Host: Yeah.  Fred Haise: But we-- I don't recall we talked a lot at the time. As we got to view the Moon, Jack and I had some cameras ready to sightsee and shoot a bunch of pictures. We had several Hasselblad’s rigged to shoot some pictures as we went around the Moon. Turned out we were at a higher point than previous flights. We were 130 miles above the surface, which gave us a larger span of the Moon to shoot. Farouk El-Baz, one of our trainers for lunar geology, in the lunar scene told us afterwards that we shot some very good pictures that had not been shot before. I think he was trying to make us feel good, that we had done something right on this mission. Something that-- to contribute something. So, anyway, I don't recall talking very much about the situation.  Host: Now Jim, do you have a moment during the mission where you could actually take a step back and just realize where you were and appreciate-- some moment of awe during your journey around the Moon?  Jim Lovell: Well, yes. I of course, there was no choice but to have to go around the Moon to get back home again. We were glad that the, getting back on the free-returning course was done, because one of our problems in the lunar module was the fact that we had the command service module attached to us. So, the center of gravity of the lunar module was way out in left field, which meant that you know, trying to control the lunar module was a little bit different. It was like driving a car, and you wanted to go right, you had to turn the wheel left. But we finally got through that OK.  Host: Yes. Fred, do you remember seeing the Earth from the Moon at any point, and what were those feelings?  Fred Haise: Well, overall, I guess one of the two surprising or maybe unusual or, as you say awe things about flying in space, it was my first time. One was zero-g, obviously to experience that on a continuum. But it was the scenes out the window, not just around the Moon, but even the Earth, and as it faded away as we left, swiftly. But then looking at the Moon as we went by, and of course seeing the small Earth, which is a very beautiful body in contrast to the Moon. So that-- out the window views were just unbelievable at times. I'd look and see, am I really here looking at what I'm looking at? So that kind of thing.  Host: Yes. Now Fred, you mentioned there was a lot of points where you weren't talking. I'm sure there were moments where you were thinking about other things. Maybe thinking about your family. Jim, do you remember at some points just sort of wondering about your family, how they were doing? Knowing that they were watching you and hoping for a safe return.  Jim Lovell: Oh yes, of course I thought about my family all the time. And I also-- you know, thought about just where I am and what I'm doing. But it was one of these things that I think, and people who are trained to be test pilots, and looking at problems as they occurred, that you have to have a positive attitude. You have to look at what you've got, and how can you get home. And as long as we could get over one crisis after another, we kept, you know, thinking positive, and until we finally made the landing.  Host: And you had that mindset too, Fred, about just trying to remain positive and stay the course, and think about those next things, those next steps?  Fred Haise: Yes, until it's over, it's not over.  Host: Yeah.  Fred Haise: I had one point where I was alone in the lunar module, and went into some compartment, I think I was looking for something to eat, and found pictures of my family that had been placed there. I didn't, somebody else did. And it made me think. But I was not worried so much about the family because I knew they had lots of support. At every mission, you had other astronauts, other wives. I knew they would be at the home to support the wife. And of course, NASA had a protocol officer that was normally posted there, that would take care of anything the wife wanted taken care of, effectively. Answer the phone, or go get groceries, or whatever. So, I knew the family at least was being supported by others back home.  Host: Did you get a chance to talk to them? When was the next time you actually got to talk to your family after the mission?  Fred Haise: No unlike later-- I guess Skylab even-- no we had no-- we only had the regular air-to-ground to-- so we never talked to the families until we got back.  Host: Yes. Can you tell me what some of the-- you know, coming back from the mission, talking to the family and thinking about-- thinking about your place, after returning, you know, this mission we thought it was going to go one way, but it didn't. But you returned safely. Can you talk about just the conversations you had with the family and just with some of the flight control teams, now that you are home safe? What was going on there? Jim, we'll start with you.  Jim Lovell: Well, naturally when we finally got home there was a big sigh of relief. And we met the family in Hawaii I believe, and everybody was happy about that. But then you know, you kind of look back and say you know, my last mission, that's what I thought it was going to be, was to land on the Moon, and now-- that was no longer it. So, there was a little bit of disappointment to it, even though my wife didn't think there was any disappointment. She got me home, and that was the main thing. But then I realized, I realized over the years, after I look back on this flight, that it was a failure, but it was also a success in the fact that at-- by the time Apollo 13 flew, this was the 5th flight to the Moon. People were getting sort of bored by this time. And it suddenly brought back to the populous of the importance of the space program, and what we're actually doing, and the success we had in the past. And it brought people back to looking at NASA in a more positive mode and following the flights that followed 13.  Host: Fred, did you see sort of that same, similar idea, that there was more attention toward some of the later Apollo missions?  Fred Haise: Well, one of the surprises to me was, when we got back, was to see some of the media, newspapers, because we really didn't know how this was being taken. Never on the radio was ever discussed how this mission with the problems was being received, was it-- or in fact, sort of back of my mind was would this call for the cancelation of the program? Which I certainly didn't want on my tombstone. But anyway, it was amazing. I mean, it was worldwide attention, worldwide prayers, wishing us well to get back. So, I was just amazed how that was taken. It was not, as Jim said, a successful failure. It was not taken that way at all. It was taken as a great achievement in that we got back safely.  Host: Yes. Now there was a lot you had to endure in that, and a lot of work that went into making that-- either you know, calling it a successful failure, or just a mission to celebrate, there was a lot learned from a personal aspect, from a human aspect. Jim, do you recall anything that you learned personally, just as a human being, and what human beings are capable of to deal with problems like this, and to learn from them, and adapt moving on?  Jim Lovell: Well, of course I think of the period that we were there, I really learned that you can't suddenly have a problem, and then just you know, close your eyes and hope there's a miracle coming on, because the miracle is something you have to do yourself, or having people to help you. Any kind of a problem that we have. And so, to me, this was a milestone of my life, and we got over it, and of course, I've had crisis before, and I've had crisis after that. I take everyone very carefully and thoughtfully.  Host: You know, one thing I admire just about the mission itself is just I know-- I know there was a lot of elements against you. You know, you had of course, the stirring the oxygen tanks, the explosions, aborting the Moon landing, but just during the flight, I know it was cold. It was-- there was a lot of condensation. There wasn't much drinking water. There was a lot that you just had to endure from a survivability perspective. Can you tell me what was going through your mind, Fred, to push through that, and make sure that you were going to accomplish the mission and return home?  Fred Haise: Well we did, with the conditions, powering down it did get very chilly. I don't know the exact temperature in the [Lunar Excursion Module] LEM we didn't have a temperature gauge. It did freeze the water tanks in the mothership, command module. In fact, I was told they found them still frozen when they inspected the capsule after it had been recovered on the aircraft carrier. And it-- so we did the best we could. We got out our spare underwear, and so I think I had three sets of underwear on, under my garments. And Jim and I donned our lunar boots. Poor Jack didn't have a set of lunar boots, so he had to suffer a little more. Plus, he got his feet wet, with the water gun leak. So, we-- you know, we did the best we could with the clothing we had, and people ask why didn't we get in our suits? And the problem was, if you got into your suit without air hoses available to hook up for cooling, you'd perspire. Then you're worried about getting out of your suit to freeze to death if you had to go to the bathroom. And then we only had one set of hoses available. Because one set was tied up with the lithium cartridge fix. And so only one of us could have worn a suit at any given time. And I think Jim decided we should all suffer equally. So, we did not try to put on spacesuits during that period.  Jim Lovell: Poor Fred got a little sick there on the way with a little infection. So, you know, I had to keep him warm by bundling up around him. You know, I put my arms around him.  Host: [laughter] Yes. That was an important element to getting through all this, right? Was working together as a team. I'm guessing you guys were very close during, and very close after, just the sense of camaraderie to get through that, Jim.  Jim Lovell: That's right.  Host: Yes. Now here we are, you know, 50 years later talking about this again, and I'm sure you know this is absolutely not the first time you've had to sit down and talk to people and tell this story. It's just a fascinating story. Here we are 50 years later, still talking about it. You've gone through so many-- there's books, there's movies, there's all the different ways that you can learn about this mission. Is there something, whenever people are telling this story, either through a podcast or movie, something that just cannot be captured, that you think is important to share? Fred, we can start with you.  Fred Haise: Well, one direct aspect was with that cold temperature we were at, operating at a much lower power level, water sublimators which are there to capture moisture, like every time you're breathing out, you're breathing out moisture, was not able to do its job. We were well below its specifications, and water built up everywhere. We could see it in the LEM, looking through a netting wall. We couldn't afford a real wall in the LEM for weight. You could see water globules on every turn of a connector, or two-beam, and that connector interfaces is sort of shimmering there with a little vibration from the glycol pump. And when we got into the command module to power it up, we had to get towels out to wipe off the instrument panel. It was covered with water. So, a real concern was thinking about electric shorts. Well, what saved us from that, it's one of the things of accidents and tragedies is you can learn from them, that's what had happened with the Apollo 1 fire that killed the crew on the launch pad. We did a significant redesign of the command module, some structural things like the hatch. But also, a very rigid rewiring. It was specification. So, sealing that connector interfaces, which is done not just on the command module, but also the lunar modules. And so anyway, that fix that was made out of that accident, and that's since waterproofed, all of that. So, we did not suffer, probably would have suffered maybe an electric short with that water buildup everywhere. So that really effectively, the results out of an accident board in finding helped save us on 13 as well.  Host: Yes. The lessons from that. Jim, anything that you find that has not been captured that's worth sharing?  Jim Lovell: Well, yes. Of course, one of the things that occurred was the fact that we had of course used the lunar module as a life boat to get home. And that means there was three people in that lunar module for four days, and the lunar module was designed for two people for two days. And consequently, the carbon dioxide was building up because they only provided enough things to remove the carbon dioxide for two people. And so, it was getting oversaturated. The container was. And so, we had to figure out a jury-rig, and this was really the initiative on part of the Mission Control and Crew Systems Division, use the canisters in the command module, which were 1/4-inch square to fit into a facility that usually took round canisters, or oblong canisters, and this was done. And they, at mission control, they figured out how to do it. They sent up the orders to us, and the three of us put the thing together, and by God, it worked. And so, it was a perfect example of team work, and thinking sort of outside the box. But also slowing down and not trying to rush things. And we got rid of the carbon dioxide to safely get home, otherwise that would have been the end of us.  Host: Yes. Fred you talked about learning from Apollo 1, and some of the lessons learned from that redesigned the capsule that ultimately led to something that helped you survive Apollo 13. I'm sure you, thinking about what Jim was just mentioning, some of these lessons learned on Apollo 13, carbon dioxide buildup, jerry-rigging something, using existing materials. Some of these lessons from Apollo 13 needed to be carried to future missions. Do you see some of that? Did-- do you see some of that implemented? Some of the lessons learned on Apollo 13 going forward?  Fred Haise: Well, it's probably more than I can think of, but certainly the fuel cells, the next-generation fuel cells were made so they were restartable, the ones on space shuttle. Our fuel cells, Jim mentioned this. One of the first things he noticed, the fuel cells-- we had lost fuel cells. That was because the reactor valves had gotten closed by the G-shock of the explosion. And they-- and that immediately killed those fuel cells, and they were not restartable on Apollo. So, there was a different I guess specification put on the ones for space shuttle, that could be restarted. Simple things, like I'm sure later missions, I know Apollo 14 started, had some blank paper. We had no blank paper. Which was a problem for writing some of these different varieties of procedures. So that-- also mods were made on Apollo 14 to add one limb descent battery. And they also added a set of cryogenic tanks on the opposite side of the spacecraft, from the side where they were all clustered on our service module. So, you know, some things like that were, call it lessons learned that were applied downstream.  Host: Yes. Jim, did you see the same things, some of these lessons from Apollo 13 going forward, and just impacting future human spaceflight?  Jim Lovell: Oh yes. Just as Fred said, they-- fortunately they learned from mistakes and that was it. And of course, one of the things they had to do which was the cause of the accident, was back in, I think it was 1965, the spacecraft builder I had said to the people that were building these liquid oxygen tanks, to replace the thermostats in the liquid oxygen tanks from 28-volt to 40-volt, because they thought that perhaps sometime one of these spacecraft in those final stages prior to launch, and they're out at the launch site, there was available 65-volt power, and if something happened, they would like to use that ground power, rather than set up those fuel cells for ship's power. So, they wanted those thermostats changed. But unfortunately, that directive was never followed, and the 28-volt thermostats were in the fuel cells at the time-- or in the oxygen tanks, and that was really one of the items that caused the explosion eventually.  Host: Yes. Now you're both-- you know, definitely technically-minded. I see a lot of technical lessons learned, but I know even after NASA, just going through this, you both had careers in the private sector, executives. I know Fred, you were at Grumman, and Jim a number of other companies in a leadership position, in a management position. Were there values, were there lessons from Apollo 13, or from your tenure at NASA that you carried into that private sector, and into your management style and way of carrying yourself and working with teams? Fred, we'll start with you.  Fred Haise: Well, I think if you say \"leadership,\" for me probably the founding basis for me was the military. My military experience as a Marine Corps, and two different Marine fighter squadrons. And I think it was being part of a military organization that kind of got you set in the right direction for both following orders and giving orders in the right way to be a leader. And so, you know, that was kind of the foundation, I would say.  Host: So, it was those military experiences that you carried into NASA, and then carried forward from there.  Fred Haise: Yes.  Host: Yes. And Jim, were you the same way?  Jim Lovell: Yes. Basically, the same way. Of course, the military is a great place to learn leadership.  Host: Yes.  Jim Lovell: And even leadership after we got into NASA, you know and basically to-- to the Apollo, to look at it very carefully to determine the solution. Just don't jump into things, and then also you know, be comfortable to the crew if something goes on. And that's what happened on all the flights that I was on. Certainly 13 was -- we all knew what to do, and we all did it.  Host: Now you know, Apollo 13, I believe lasted six days, but you know, again, here we are 50 years later, talking about it. Can you tell me how it shaped, just the way-- the rest of your life? Maybe through family. Maybe through-- because it captured the hearts and minds of so many people, your willingness to share this story. I mean you're both here with me today, and I very much appreciate it. Fred, we'll start with you. How did those six days shape the next 50 years?  Fred Haise: I don't really think it changed much for me. I did not-- I guess I looked at flying into space as just an adjunct of my aviation and test piloting career. It was not a religious-type experience. For me it was just another great adventure. And I had no I'll call it change in mindset about things, particularly following that flight. Of course, the notoriety of that, and being an astronaut obviously helped in some ways with my career. Probably gave me the start I had at Grumman, for instance. But you know, other than that, that was a benefit, certainly.  Host: Yes.  Fred Haise: But that's about it.  Host: Now Jim, did you have something similar, or maybe something different?  Jim Lovell: Well, very similar. Similar in the fact that I never worried about problems, you know? After we got through Apollo 13, I figured that any other problem coming along were going to be, you know, survivable, and so I just didn't, didn't have a real worry about following things. And I went through, you know, various different businesses. And I ended up doing quite a bit of speaking, which brought back old memories of the flight that Fred and I were on.  Host: Yes. Now 50 years later, what we're talking about now is this Artemis generation. We're talking about returning to the Moon, but we're talking about staying. What are some of the values from, you know, working at NASA, working during the Apollo program, that you think are important to pass onto this Artemis generation, to the future generation? Fred, we'll start with you.  Fred Haise: Well, I'll have to say what I know about Artemis and the program in any detail is only what I get from the media.  Host: Oh sure.  Fred Haise: As I-- I really am just interested in there being a continuation of exploration. And there's been a lot of arguments about whether go back to the Moon or go to Mars. But I'm happy that there'll be some sustenance in tackling it this way. Little-- I think they're going at it a little different way. More launches required than-- we had one launch to do it. I think there are several launches involved in Artemis, in the plans. But otherwise that's what-- just I hope it continues and rejuvenates people that are working here at NASA at the various sites that are supporting it to make it all happen. And have the continued support through Congress and the administration.  Host: What about exploration is so valuable?  Fred Haise: Well, I think it's valuable certainly from things that we learn just from Earth observations. There's that part of it as well. Learning about our Earth and protecting it, and knowing about things here, but otherwise, very, very long-term, there's obviously a concern about the survivability of the human race. We've had major extinctions on Earth. Hopefully none very soon again, but there's something to be said that we should use some part of this talent we're blessed with. Because we humans are uniquely able to go outward and to explore that. So far at least, no other critters have showed up that think they could do that.  Host: Yes.  Fred Haise: So, it's kind of a blessing that we have, and the ability we've been given by the creator that we should maybe use our talent in that direction.  Host: Now Jim, your thoughts about this next-- this future of exploration.  Jim Lovell: Well, I think the future of exploration has a lot to do with the makeup of the people that are growing up, again the children. I have met a lot of people, you know, in their 40s and 50s now that said, look it, I followed the program when I was just a kid, and that sort of got me into engineering, or into something else like that. And so, the space program was essentially an incentive to a lot of people who liked what we were doing in space as they were children, and then followed their dreams to do something else. Not so much go into NASA or anything like that, but actually accomplishing something because of what we accomplished.  Host: Yes. Do you think that's important? To make sure there's this sense of inspiration, either through, you know, space exploration, or other avenues? That sense of inspiring, you know, STEM fields, and people to go into more technical careers?  Jim Lovell: That's right. I think the space program has incentive to a lot of people to get into technical businesses, engineering, or something of this nature. And outside from the physical, you know, introduction of new science and new engineering, and new things that we deal with now every day. You know, the communications, and the computer technology, and things of this nature.  Host: Yes. Fred, what inspired you to do something more technical, you flying aircraft, what inspired you to pursue that career?  Fred Haise: The Korean War.  Host: Oh yes.  Fred Haise: Yes. I was actually-- first two years of college, I was going to be a journalist.  Host: Oh!  Fred Haise: And was majoring in journalism. And the Korean War had come along, and I decided to serve my country, and the program I went into was a naval aviation cadet program. And became a pilot. So that caused a 90-degree turn, because I love flying, and I said that's now my career. Somehow, it's going to be in aviation.  Host: [laughter] Now Jim, what was your inspiration to pursue that path?  Jim Lovell: Well, just about the same thing. Of course, the wars-- I've got to do the naval aviation when I graduated from the Naval Academy. And then was, you know, it was squadrons in between the wars, and then just before the-- I guess it was Vietnam at that time, that I got into the space program.  Host: Yes. I'm sure you both return to NASA occasionally, every once in a while. What do you see when you return here? How things have shaped over 50 years? Fred, we'll start with you.  Fred Haise: Well, I'm here really not any more-- as a visitor I'd say at JSC. I'm not involved, have not been involved technically, except of some of the contracts I had when I was at Northrop Grumman, which is not since 1996 now. But anyway, I obviously come here to the campus, and of course, I see a lot of these added security features. That's happened everywhere I guess.  Host: Sure.  Fred Haise: The government installations since 9/11. But otherwise, I come to support the summer of aerospace scholar groups. I've been here to talk to teacher groups that meet here, and events over at Space Center Houston through the year, since I live here in Houston. It's convenient, and I've supported still supported NASA in that way, more in the education area.  Host: Jim, what about you?  Jim Lovell: Well, I you know-- JSC has always been the place where I, you know, had all my experiences and everything. As a matter of fact, we were going to have a 50th anniversary of Apollo 13 there at JSC, but it happened to be on the Saturday between Good Friday and Easter, and Krantz decided that wasn't the thing to do. So, then I can't go down to the new time, and so Fred-o, you're going to have to take over for me if you're going to go to that. [Laughter]  Fred Haise: Alright.  Host: Yes. No, we are at the 50th anniversary. I'm sure you're getting a lot of these requests to come and talk about it. Thinking about this anniversary, the golden anniversary of Apollo 13, what do you think is the legacy of Apollo 13? Jim, we'll start with you.  Jim Lovell: Well, the legacy is that essentially don't give up. Or essentially look at a problem in all aspects to try to solve it. Thirteen was a classic example of that. But through all of life, and throughout in people, there's a probable time that are similar to what we had on 13. And you must, you know, have a positive attitude.  Host: Your thoughts, Fred?  Fred Haise: I think it's simply the slogan if you will, that's come out and is used in a lot of ways I see these days, that came out in the movie about Apollo 13. And that was, failure is not an option.  Host: Yes. [laughter] That is true. I love that. Gentlemen, any final thoughts before we part ways? Now thinking about-- now that we've been talking about Apollo 13, that we're approaching this 50th anniversary, any final thoughts? Jim, I'll pass it over to you first.  Jim Lovell: No, I think that-- that I'd like to see the program continue as long as it provides positive results to help our country and help the world. I enjoyed my tenure in the space program. And I hope that other people do the same.  Host: Wonderful. Now, Fred?  Fred Haise: I don't think I have anything to add to what Jim said. I just hope the program, it will be continued to be supported. And we can move forward and be at the Moon first. Let's go do the Moon.  Host: [laughter] Well, gentlemen, it has been such an honor and a privilege to talk to you today on the 50th anniversary of Apollo 13. Just really appreciate your time, and I wish you the best of luck in these next couple months, as everyone else is going to be asking for your time as well, and for the future. Thank you so much, gentlemen.  Jim Lovell: Well, thank you for the call.  Fred Haise: Alright. Thank you.  [ Music ]  Host: Hey, thanks for sticking around.

                        "description": "Gary Jordan (Host): Houston, we have a podcast. Welcome to the official podcast of the NASA Johnson Space Center, Episode 143, “Space Health Technologies,” I'm Gary Jordan and I'll be your host today. On this podcast we bring in the experts, scientists, engineers, astronauts, all to let you know what's going on in the world of human spaceflight. I hope you tuned in to our recent series on NASA's Human Research Program. We dove into the work being done at NASA to help understand what happens to the human body in areas such as human performance, human health, radiation, medicine and a whole lot more. We gave many examples through this series on different ways that the Human Research Program does research in these areas to get the best science possible. The latest science possible, using the latest technologies. Helping the Human Research Program solve challenges for human space exploration and preparing for deep space travel is the Translational Research Institute for Space Health. In this episode we'll just call it TRISH. TRISH is helping NASA conduct research on some of the latest and greatest technologies and procedures both to find out if it can be integrated in NASA's future missions and also to help these technologies develop for Earth benefits. Here to tell us about this organization, and some of the disruptive technologies and ideas are Dorit Donoviel, Ph.D., and Dr. Kristin Fabre. Dorit is the Director of TRISH. And Kristin is a Senior Innovation Scientist. And both have extensive and impressive backgrounds in science and technology, so here we go. Space Health Technologies and the work being done at TRISH to help NASA test the latest medical technologies and advances with Dorit Donoviel and Kristin Fabre. I hope you enjoy.  [ Music]  Host: Dorit and Kristin, thanks so much for coming on the podcast today.  Kristin Fabre: Thank you, my pleasure to be here.  Dorit Donoviel: It's a pleasure.  Host: So, TRISH, I like saying TRISH because it sounds like another person. But it is an organization. Dorit why don't you tell me what TRISH is and what you do?  Dorit Donoviel: Yeah, I know, it sounds like a Texas soccer mom, right? [Laughter] Driving in a minivan. Yeah, it's hard to take us seriously. But that's OK because where are all about having fun with the work that we do. So, it's the Translational Research Institute. That was the original name. But it's so generic and there's so many out there, and it doesn't really tell you what the institute does. So, when I became director I changed the name to Translational Research Institute for Space Health, which is unfortunately -- it was very close to being TRASH, but it's actually TRISH now. [Laughter]   Host: I'm glad you stayed away from TRASH. [Laughter]  Dorit Donoviel: Yeah me too. We are just so happy and -- to be a partner with NASA. We are a standalone research institute that essentially functions through a cooperative agreement with NASA. We work very closely with the Human Research Program and we're entrusted to basically go out there and find what NASA is not already doing, in terms of reducing the risks to human health and performance in deep space. So, we're very Mars forward. We’re very focused on the future, those missions that haven't yet been scoped out. Our job is to connect with the most innovative technologies, companies, researchers all over the world. But really funding things on U.S. soil and bring them forward to NASA to take a look at, to see whether they can integrate them into their current research portfolio.  Host: Yeah, because sometimes you can sort of get caught in the regular routine of research. You're not really looking out for some of those latest and greatest technologies that might fit the needs, which we're looking for all the time.  Dorit Donoviel: Yeah in science people tend to get siloed. They tend to have a favorite hypothesis or a certain way of thinking about things. And they do work that takes decades to come to fruition and sometimes you're blind to what else is going on in the outside world. And so that's precisely why NASA needed an external organization. To go out there and look at things from a new perspective and to help them sort of realize if there's a better way of doing things.  Host: So, how is TRISH integrated? Because I see -- Baylor College of Medicine is sort of intertwined with all of this. What's that relationship like?  Dorit Donoviel: Yeah so, the cooperative agreement was given to Baylor College of Medicine, which is the lead institution, so it's a grant. It's a large grant from NASA through a cooperative agreement. Unlike contract -- contract though we're very free in terms of we have a lot of autonomy. But in addition to Baylor College of Medicine, we pulled in two of the most premier technological institutes in the country, one on the East Coast, MIT and one on the West Coast, Caltech. And so, we have people embedded in those communities that are working with us. And those institutions are also mandated through the relationship with the consortium with Baylor, to go out there and find things for NASA and to help build this program together with us.  Host: OK, so it is -- it's an even broader team than even just you guys? You're working across the nation?  Dorit Donoviel: It's huge. In fact, Kristin and I have been working on building and Rachael our Communication and Education Lead, building a community. That's one of the mandates that NASA wanted is for us to build a community of experts that they can -- NASA dipped its fingers into when it has a need.  Host: OK, so yeah. Kristin tell me about this --  Kristin Fabre: And this is absolutely needed because we ourselves, even though we are constantly seeking disruptive technologies or paradigm shifts in how we do science, we ourselves don't know what's going on out there and so we need our reach to be expanded across the entire country so that we have a good sense for some of that really cool cutting edge science and technology that we don't know about yet, but we're looking for them, and we want them to know that we exist because this is the challenge is being able to actually understand that and to invest in it and to implement it and to bring it to NASA. So, we ourselves are always having to force ourselves to not be comfortable in how we think. And that we're constantly pushing ourselves to think outside the box.  Host: Well tell me about how you think. Tell me a little bit about your background and what you've worked on before and how that kind of translates to what you're doing now.  Kristin Fabre: Sure, so my background -- I stumbled into radiation biology research. At first, I was very interested in cancer research, and so I was at Colorado State University looking at breast cancer research. But there was an emphasis on radiation induced breast cancer. And so, I had to understand about radiation and learn about the biological damages that it does to tissues, so that I can understand how that connects to carcinogenesis. So, when I was ready for my postdoc I actually went to National Cancer Institute at NCI and looked at radiation mitigators. So, things that can protect or to sensitize to radiation. So, can we use radiation as a tool? For example, for cancer, or can we find approaches to protect against radiation? At that point I realized that I wanted to be more involved in communication and problem solving, working the problem from a higher level. I would talk to my selves and unfortunately, they wouldn't talk back. I wanted to have conversations about science. And so, I went into the National Institute -- the National Institute of Health has a great program for trainees and for fellows. And they have these, the Extra-Mural Program, which is essentially how NIH funds all of the research across the country. And so, I became a program manager looking at these micro-physiological systems or organs on chips or tissue chips, whatever you want to call them. But, they're basically these human complex and future models that mimic the micro environment of an organ or a tissue of interest. And because of that effort that we pulled together, at the National Center for Advancing Translational Science or NCATS. I was pulled into pharma, because they wanted to look at these types of technologies on how they can use these tissue chips or micro physiological systems for drug development, trying to either identify new targets or how safe is their drug going to be. And because of all of that background, it really put me in a very unique place for really helping to read and the TRISH mission on how we can use our public private partnerships, how we can look at funding agencies, how we can look at pharmaceutical companies and industry to really drive the mission forward.  Host: What a whirlwind of a path. [Laughter]  Kristin Fabre: I have no idea how I got here honestly. [Laughter]  Host: What I like about your path is you're saying you were -- passionate about cancer research and then you know through this research you get pulled into these different areas. Next thing you know, you're working on these tiny little technologies for drug development. But you started all the way back here with cancer research.  Kristin Fabre: You just allow yourself to go with the wind.  Host: Yeah, I love it.  Dorit Donoviel: And now it's space.  Host: And now it's space. Actually, you know funny enough we actually have had Lucie Low on the podcast to talk about -  Kristin Fabre: I know Lucie very well.  Host: Yeah to talk about tissue chips and what a fascinating technology. So -- and I guess it's through tissue chips that you got involved with space health and the space equitability.  Kristin Fabre: It was the start, I think that's probably what peeked my interest in my background. That and the industry, and government experience, looking at being a part of a funding agency myself, having that background.  Dorit Donoviel: I searched high and low for just the perfect person and here she is. I mean it just like whoa. [Laughter]  Host: With a path like that, how can you not say \"Yes, please come join our team.\" So, you're the Director of TRISH?  Dorit Donoviel: I am the Director, yes.  Host: So, what's your background?  Dorit Donoviel: Well I have a very old background. I'm old -- much older than Kristin. [Laughter] Yeah, I also never thought I'd end up in space. I actually was doing a lot of genetic engineering and mouse embryos and making genetic models for diseases at Lexicon Pharmaceuticals before I came to Baylor. And it was the once in a lifetime opportunity when people say you know, “come work with the space program and combine your love of science and biology and medicine and apply it in a whole new way, off the planet.”  Host: I know.  Dorit Donoviel: It was like what? OK let's try this for a while. And it's just turned out to be the most amazing experience and just blows your mind the kinds of things you see and learn. Every day is something new and delightful to work with people like Kristin and others. It's just a joy.  Host: So, what about -- what is it about the space applicability that sort of surprised you when you just started getting entered into that world?  Dorit Donoviel: This is a great question, probably the most important question you're going to ask today. Because for your audience, people just don't understand it until we explain it. So, number one, I always say that if you can do it in space, you can do it anywhere. In other words, and when I say do it, I mean healthcare. [Laughter]  Host: Healthcare, OK.  Dorit Donoviel: Although, there was recently an article about doing it another way, but the -- so if you're able to keep a human healthy and thriving on the way to Mars, which is a really long trip and bring them back safe and healthy, you can do it anywhere on Earth, which mean seniors in the home, not having to go into managed care facilities. You can do it in Third World nations; you can keep people healthy in remote places that they don't have access to doctors. So that's one, so we have a whole new model for healthcare in thinking about that mission to Mars.  Host: Wow, because there's so much -- there's so much autonomy, you don't have the doctors, you don't have the right facilities, yet it has to be compact. So, all these issues and all these problems you have to address for spaceflight, yes, it would be applicable to remote areas, to that level of autonomy.  Kristin Fabre: As a matter of fact, every project that's in our portfolio we have an impact for space and an impact for here on Earth. And a lot of that is how to reach the patients that are hard to reach or how do you get that autonomy? How can you make this easier for people to grasp so that we all have a chance to have good treatment and good monitoring, good diagnostics with the types of technologies that we support?   Dorit Donoviel: And it's generally about prevention. You never want to get to a point where you have a major medical event. So, it's monitoring and predicting and preventing. And that's the model that should be there for healthcare, because we -- we intervene too late. By then the outcomes are too late for healthcare. So, you know who is interested in working with us? Are the payers. The insurance companies, because they're trying to reduce the cost of healthcare. And they're wanting to move away from hospitals and a lot of you know expensive procedures and experts into the home and to prevent. So, that's who's talking to us and it's great for NASA because we're able to make those connections. We just don't have enough money like you know the budget for the health-related research within NASA is much smaller than the NIH. And so, we need somebody to come up behind us and continue to support a lot of the things that we're investing in.  Host: Yeah, they're interested in the eat healthy now and exercise, so you don't have to deal with it later.  Dorit Donoviel: That's right.  Host: But, for spaceflight.  Dorit Donoviel: The second point I wanted to make about why space is such an important model for us to use here for Earth, you know all the applications. Because people ask me all the time, \"Why should we spend all this money on four people who are going to live you know -- what does that have to do with me?\"  Host: Yeah, we hear that a lot.  Dorit Donoviel: Yeah, well space is an accelerated aging model. And so, everything that we see here on Earth, with probably the exception of diabetes, although we have seen in prolonged zero-gravity people becoming less sensitivity to insulin. You know astronauts generally are healthy people, that's the majority of the population. But when you put them into space, all the aging things that we see like loss of muscle, loss of bone, deconditioning of the heart, change in vision, change in balance, hearing loss, isolation, some of the behavioral things that happen, even as resilient as they are. There are some behavioral issues. You know lack of appropriate nutrition, although we try to give them as much food as we can. But on the way to Mars we may not be able to give them fresh foods. So, all of those things, there's you know so when you combine them, that astronaut is becoming an old person, prematurely. With the radiation as well. So, if we can solve all those problems, we're actually making a difference here for many of the aging related issues here on Earth.  Kristin Fabre: Right, and really to tease those mechanisms apart. Because we know that the aging is similar -- advance aging is similar in space. It's not the same. I mean it's not the exact same as somebody that's just aging here on Earth. But to Dorit's point there's a lot of end points that are very similar. But actually, are reversed when they come back to Earth, which is where it's different than how it is on Earth. So, if we can tease apart some of those mechanisms and understand you know, how is it that a lot of these components happen in space? But then are somehow reversed or reduced when they come back to Earth. Can we maybe understand the story about aging to the population a little bit better? Which is an exciting question in itself.  Host: I'm loving the passion that's coming from both of you when it comes to all these things. But what I find fascinating is your backgrounds are so different, we're talking genetics. We're talking cancer research and then drug development. But now we're talking about aging. Tell me about the team at TRISH and what -- what all the expertise is and how you're getting together to look at some of these problems that you're talking about. Because it sounds like it's cross-disciplinary.  Dorit Donoviel: Yeah, the thing is that you can never cover it all. You become really jack of all trades, master of none, which is actually a really good thing. Because if you start to think that you're a master of something, that you think you know it all, when somebody comes in with a different point of opinion, you know a different opinion you're like oh no, you dismiss it. So, if you allow yourself to sort of say OK, I know just enough to connect the dots. OK and to ask the right people if you know enough to know this is an expert. I'm going to go to them and take in what they have to say. That's when you start to make those real innovations, those real connections because somebody over here is an expert in micro-fluidics. And somebody over here is a material scientist. And somebody over here is a physiologist. And by taking all those little pieces and putting them all in the room and say talk about this problem. They come up with things, but we're the ones that put them together. So, we have such a diverse team. We have somebody at Caltech who is essentially comes from you know, biomedical engineering. We have somebody at MIT that is a brain scientist essentially; he uses technology to image the brain. We have an emergency medicine physician that's working closely with Kristin. We have a former NASA biomedical engineer working with Kristin here in Houston. We have an orthopedic surgeon part time at UCSF. My Deputy James Hury is -- comes from Texas Children's Hospital and he's done innovation for children in healthcare. So, you pull all these different people together and you get a real mix of opinions, which is delightful and really fun.  Kristin Fabre: It's actually a really unique team and I think that we talk about it all the time. We're very fortunate because you know, I've been to a lot of places and I've seen a lot of backgrounds and TRISH is unique in terms of -- as Dorit said we have a lot of different opinions. We have a lot of backgrounds that are different, but we somehow figure out a way to gel and move the mission forward. We're all rock stars. Our communications lead, Rachael is a rock star. We have a genetics person that helps me with solicitation. She's a rock star. We're all really strong in our field, which makes it such a unique place to be is that we can really gel together and move the mission forward. But I also want to speak to not only that, but Dorit said earlier how we're trying to build that space health community. That is crucial for us because as she said we are not experts in everything that we need to be experts in. So, it's really important for us to reach out to people that have never even thought about space research. Have never thought about how their technologies could be useful for NASA or for space health in general. Because we need them to be our subject matter experts. We need them to come to us and say, \"Hey have you thought about this?\" \"Hey, I know that this tool exists, but have you thought about it - using it this way?\" So, in addition to our rock star team, it's that space health community that we really need to continue to grow so that we can really have the subject matter experts and the ideas coming to us all the time.  Dorit Donoviel: So, I want to add something to that, which is really important. So, there's a lot of brilliant people out in the world. They have a lot of great ideas. The problem for NASA is that they're not focused or they're not reasonable for what NASA needs. In other words, yeah you can suggest doing MRI's in space, but you know, you have to educate people you can't take an MRI machine. Or,” hey let's do an x-ray;’’ well we really don't want to introduce more radiation in space, we already have enough radiation. Or people come up with fantastic ideas. But what's reasonable and what is the -- the other thing is NASA everything's a trade, right? So, if I'm going to choose to take this medical device, that means I can't take this food. Or I have to take less water. Or, I have to reduce the habitable volume if I have to include this particular medical device. So, NASA is always thinking about what do I absolutely have to have, not what's nice to have. So, there's lots of wonderful things that people come up with and tell us about and they want to take it to space, or they want us to take it to space. And they're lovely, wonderful inventions. But we always have to be thinking about NASA. So, our other job, other than reaching out and bringing those technologies in, is educating. We have to explain to people in layman's terms or, “hey, I know you're in love with your technology. You're a researcher and you love your research and we get it. It's important. But it doesn't fit with NASA's need or here's why we need you to work on it differently.” So, it's part of our job to sort of educate the public, so it's a two-way communication, so we act as the go between. And I sort of call ourselves our mom and pop NASA. Because we're much more approachable. Like it's very hard to talk to somebody at NASA to get them to speak to you.  Host: We speak in acronyms. [Laughter]  Dorit Donoviel: You do, it's a whole new thing. But we're much more approachable. Like Kristin's -- we have a Salesforce is something we use, it's used in business as a way to manage leads. And Rachael, our communication lead put together a community force, we call it the orbit. And people in there can ask questions where you can sort of have like a chat and get access to experts within NASA and us and so.  Host: This is what you -- this is when you said community, this is what you mean. It's not -- you don't want to be a resource. You don't want to be a hub where everyone is coming to you. You want to make sure you build that community and establish that two-way communication. Because -  Dorit Donoviel: And educate them --  Host: And educate --  Kristin Fabre: And for them to have conversations with the community.  Host: With each other.  Kristin Fabre: So, we don't need to always be a part of that conversation. We -- there are examples where there are folks that have technologies that are going on to station soon. And they want to reach out to the community and say, “hey what kind of sales or what kind of questions do you have? I've got this technology, partner with me.” So, I also want to see not just a two-way communication between TRISH and the rest of the community. But I want to see the community talking amongst themselves.  Dorit Donoviel: It's already happening. I get notes all the time of people talking, like what are they talking about? I have no idea what they're talking about, but they went off.  Kristin Fabre: Absolutely and we've seen it time and time again, is allowing these people to be educated and think in a way that they never thought before. And it allows them to come up with a better, stronger idea for space health research. And that also makes them even a stronger candidate for a NASA grant in the future. And so, again, one of our deliverables is bringing people that are new to NASA in and have successful grants that can go to NASA as well.  Dorit Donoviel: Yeah so if people want to join in, anybody can. It's open to everybody it’s called TRISH.force.com. And force because we're the force. [Laughter] [Multiple Speakers] Host:  Well tell me more about this community? Are we talking universities, are we talking industry?  Dorit Donoviel: We don't exclude anybody. I mean obviously we moderate it and make sure there's no crazy people with tin hats, which we do get a few of those. But, I want to make sure that I do speak to something else that we deliver to the community, to NASA too, is we run a lot of virtual workshops. We did one through Caltech organized for us on [Artificial Intelligence] AI and healthcare. We did one with MIT, media lab on how to enrich indoor environments to improve behavior health. And we brought in a lot of different speakers and companies to talk about. Even furniture companies are thinking about these things. We had one of the sponsors of the work shop was a furniture company. And they're thinking about how to change indoor environments to improve your performance at work. So, you know --  Host: --Ergonomics.  Dorit Donoviel: Yeah you never know. It's not just ergonomics. It's like your mood, like the lighting, the sun. When you talk to some of the astronauts they'll say, \"You know it's a whole year with no change in seasons.\" It's like the same air, the same smell, the same temperature, the same humidity --  Kristin Fabre: --Monochrome.  Dorit Donoviel: Yeah and it's very sterile. So, OK maybe they could put up with it for a year on the ISS, but on the way to Mars, that's a whole different thing. So, we have that workshop. Everything is archived. We do a lot of -- we call it the Red Risk Schools. So, NASA prioritized Human Research Program prioritized the risks by color. So red, stop you know. Yellow, medium and then green we're probably OK to go. So, we call it the Red Risks, which are highest priority, “hey we need to solve these problems before we go to Mars.” So, we put on the Red Risk School. And so, you know for a whole week and there's one coming up let's see Rachael, when is it coming up? In February we'll do the next one, but we also archived the last two years, we've also done it -- we have experts speaking on it from NASA or the community about the top risks, what are the problems, what are the needs, how people's research can fit in. So that's all archived through our website and also the TRISH force, you can find links to it. And then we did recently a work shop with a local subject matter expert as a young entrepreneur started this company on [Virtual Reality] VR. Brought in experts from all over the world, I mean he had people because this was virtual, so you had people from you know the UK, Australia, Spain, you know obviously the U.S. Just from everywhere talking about how to use VR and what are the latest technologies, VR for training. VR for behavior health. VR to improve your exercise. Just how to use VR and then we had a NASA expert explaining OK what are the limitations in the space environment, so it was sort of like a comprehensive thing. So, we're trying to provide a lot of that content, but I didn't even get to the main thing that we do. That's like the extra stuff. The main thing we do, most of our money is to fund research. So, we give a lot of research grants and they're through solicitations, but they're also like if you have a great idea come on in and tell Kristin about it. We have you know a dashboard where we can look at things, through -- you can find it through our website or you can find it through TRISHforce.com. And you know Kristin -- so we do solicitation. So, there -- either to companies or universities and we give a lot of money away. We give a lot of money away, millions of dollars to various people. And we have a training program. We have post-doctoral fellows, actually the fellowship I think opportunity the current one closes today. We -- I think I'll save it for the next one for what we have current opportunities open. But Kristin why don't you talk a little bit about the radiation solicitation.  Kristin Fabre: Sure, so we have just opened a radiation solicitation. So again, my background being at NCATS is that the tissue chips. And you -- so you're familiar with that with your discussion with Lucie Low so it's on a previous podcast. And what we want to do, so tissue chips or micro physiological systems are not -- they're not very new anymore. They've been around for a while, lots of publications, pharmaceutical companies are starting to use them. Other agencies are starting to invest in them. But, we want to see how we can use these technologies for again looking at human tissue for the first time, physiological system, human tissue to look at space relevant radiation. So that's -- that's goal number one, is can we use these as a human analog? And then can we look at multiple tissues of interest or organs of interest to see what would happen maybe with or connected, single or connected; so that's goal one. And the other goal is countermeasures, and so there's a lot of effort and there's always been a lot of effort on radiation countermeasures, a lot of people have their favorite pharmaceutical or nutraceutical. And so, we're allowing that to be tested as a proof of concept in the tissue chip as well. But, where I really want to -- I'm going to say the word TRISH out, so where I wanted to go bold and beyond is that come up with another outside of the box countermeasure. And a lot of people, so right now are -- our current portfolio has some work on looking at gene editing. Looking at tardigrades, so can we embrace our inner tardigrade or water bear system and the genes that make them radiation resistant? You know can we understand -- can we understand that a little bit better? Is there any homologs that are within our DNA that we can transiently induce for a short period of time, and I know that can be controversial, but it's kind of where we are sometimes, those provocative questions.  Host: Yes, this is the innovative ground-breaking technology that you're talking about.  Kristin Fabre: Right, exactly.  Host: This is what you want to explore.  [Multiple Speakers]  Kristin Fabre: Let's get a little queasy and we're probably spot on. So, what about different types of materials? What about bio-electronics? What about a whole different approach? What about slowing down metabolism and seeing if we can allow the cells time to repair their DNA? What about saving the stem cell campaign? Can we have a batch of stem cells for astronauts that we can re-introduce them to and to the tissue later to see if we can keep like a fresh healthy batch of cells? These are just examples. I want people to come up with other ideas too, but that's where we really want to push the boundaries with these types of technologies. And that's ultimately the goal of this first solicitation on radiation and tissue chips.  Dorit Donoviel: I want to talk about -- just because this -- audience we have currently opened solicitations or programs. So, the other one, we call it the swap, which is our way of helping NASA again take its scientists and put them out in the community, so they can learn something new. And then take scientists who are out there and put them into NASA centers, so they can learn about NASA's needs and requirements. And you know the constraints of spaceflight. So, it's sort of an exchange of scientists, so it's formally known as the Faculty Exchange or the Space Health Swap. So that just went live today. And that's open to civil servants going out and open for scientists who want to spent their summer at a NASA center. And we're going to make that happen for them. So, space camp for adults.  Host: Wow, yeah you said the main thing you do is you do research grants. But we're talking about a whole bunch of other stuff too. It sounds like the education part is really important because what you're trying to accomplish is when you get these ideas, you want them to be informed. So, you're not missing out on well technically NASA needs this to be smaller. Well you really need to think about the weight of this thing. Or you need to think about the radiation aspect, because they have a ton of radiation. There's a ton of education.  Dorit Donoviel: It's particularly interesting with industry. So, let's talk about industry. So, we have an upcoming solicitation in the spring specifically for companies, because it's really not fair to companies to put them in the same mix with academics who write proposals for a living. I mean they write grant proposals for a living. And they're very, very good at writing proposals. Companies have a different approach. They generally have a slide deck that they share with an investor, they have a different time line, they're very, very good at delivering products fairly efficiently and you know especially the scrappy ones, the startups. They can do it for very little money. So that's a great bargain for NASA. We've come across quite a lot of small companies that have delivered things for very little money. And so that's wonderful, but the problem is that they need to be educated on how -- what they're already doing for their so-called Earth market, we laugh about that. The space market they're like “oh who is going to buy this?” Like NASA and one other person, maybe Elon Musk. Maybe they'll buy four; you know how is that important for my business model? Well, all the things that they're doing for Earth, we're going to make it better for Earth because it's going to be miniaturized. It's going to be cheaper. It's going to be used by non-expert user and so the high dollar in really complicated equipment, we're not really interested in, but all the things that are -- the small companies are developing for in the home care, elderly monitoring, the kiosks that are going to be going up in Walgreens that will do all of your health surveillance. The smart mirrors in the bathrooms, all of those technologies and the AI that goes behind that is very much applicable for what we’re thinking about for space the autonomous healthcare model. So, it's an education of companies to realize that what they're going to do for us is actually down the path of their own Earth market. We are not going to distract them. That's what investors are worried about that they're going to get distracted by this NASA thing over here. But no what the NASA thing is exactly in line with the market that they're going after, which is reducing cost to healthcare. And what we're going to focus on in this upcoming solicitation is behavior health. And you know this is -- people don't like to talk about it. Because astronauts are incredibly resilient human beings. I mean they're screened for this, right? But nobody has ever been in a tin can for three years, far away from Earth. Like we've done isolation studies, but nowhere near the length and the kind of danger they're going to be under. And so small of volume, and you're going to be with three people that your boss picked out for you. And you're going to smell their smell for three years. So, the behavior aspect is actually something that NASA is worried about. So, what are companies doing on monitoring behavioral health and improving behavior health and providing people with tools that they can apply themselves? We all have times of depression. And so, what can we do to mines what's out there, to help the astronauts on that -- on that long duration mission?  Host: So, what you're looking at -- you're looking at what it takes to have the resilience of an astronaut to live in a tin can for three years far away from home with the same people. Take those same applicability's and maybe check on like -- try to come up with ways for -- to improve behavior health or be resilient here on Earth. Is that sort of it? Maybe I'm on the wrong track?  Dorit Donoviel: It's not about what it takes to be resilient. We know these people are resilient. These astronauts are resilient. We know that. No. Even resilient people need cues that something is off. OK? And OK say for example I'll just give you -- I'll just paint the picture, it's always better. So, say you know an astronaut is just starting to feel down, maybe the exercise equipment broke down. Hasn't been able to exercise, is not feeling really well. Maybe the -- maybe one of the vitamins went down and now they don't have vitamin D anymore. Something like that. There's something going on right? And so that astronaut starts to maybe sleep a little more, maybe spend less time with other crew mates, maybe smile less, maybe use language that's more negative. So, there are ways to pick up on those things and the AI system would maybe inform the commando or the medical -- the medical officer of the mission. \"Hey, this crew member is a little off, check in on him.\" So maybe -- so it alerts and then maybe they make sure they get him a vitamin D. Maybe they make sure that they figure out another way to exercise. So, it starts to alert you before it actually becomes a problem, or it can alert the person themselves. “Hey, you're a little off today. What's going on? Maybe write in your journal. Maybe share this, maybe talk to the AI, maybe talk to the medical officer. Maybe try to call home and talk to your flight surgeon about what might be going on with you.” So that's what I'm talking about is to put the tools in your hand to recognize, but also have a strategy. There's no point to recognizing if you can't do anything about it. So, it's all about the countermeasures as well.  Host: The countermeasures as well, but there's that technology for identifying monitoring and realizing--  Kristin Fabre: And that's one aspect, but I'm also very interested in the physiological aspect because we do know that diet and nutrition and the microbiome can play a role in this. So, there's a lot of new research on this gut brain axis. And how what we eat can impact our mood or what's happening with our microbiome that could induce inflammation that could also impact our mood. And we don't know what radiation can do to our behavioral health or our cognitive function. So, there's also this physiological underlying that I think is also really interesting for TRISH to pursue and to invest in that address’s cognitive performance and behavioral health.  Host: So, along the lines of what we're talking about, we're investigating different examples right now. We're investigating all these different ways that you guys -- tell me about what's going on -- what else is going on right now that you're doing at TRISH?  Kristin Fabre: So, well there's -- we've recently funded something in the category of what we call “just in time medicine.” So rather than having an entire pharmaceutical kit that you have to take with you, can you make drugs on the fly? Can we take with us let's just call them ingredients for formulations for the pharmaceutical ingredient to say OK, you know we don't know what we can face or what we're going to be up against, but let's try to take a kit with us and build these drugs as needed. So, we're actually funding a couple of projects where we've selected a couple projects that can tackle this from a small molecule component. So, having the right formulations in pieces where you can build these small molecules like basically kind of in a kit where you can say I need this type of small molecule. I need this type of --  Dorit Donoviel: Can I just jump in and explain to the listeners; small molecule is the typical drugs that you take by mouth. Large molecules and pharma, because Kristin and I both came from pharma. Large molecules are the antibodies you have to inject or proteins like [Erythropoietin] EPO. So small molecules are the things that you generally take by mouth.  Host: Oral medication.  Kristin Fabre: Yeah most of our drugs are small molecules.  Host: OK.  Kristin Fabre: So, can we build those on the fly as needed? And then also going to those larger, those types of drugs that are the biologics to those larger proteins, those larger molecules, can we also build those on the fly as well? And we've actually selected a project that can or that is suggesting that they can make these larger therapeutics, these larger drugs, these biologics in lettuce. So, can you eat your drugs? So that's something that we're trying to explore as well. We're also thinking about stability of our drugs. So, we have a group that is looking at using silk protein to basically have a pouch or a case where you can put your drugs in that will protect against some of the hazards like radiation, for example. So, we're very keen on how we can keep that pharmaceutical kit fresh and relevant and safe and effective on our way to Mars and back.  Host: That's the space application, right? Is like if you buy an over the counter medicine that has an expiration date, you know you can't have it sitting on the shelf for three years. So, this would be a way to make sure that you can have the medicine you need for the entire duration –  Kristin Fabre: Correct, correct.  Dorit Donoviel: It's a Red Risk. It's what we call the Red Risk.  Host: Red Risk.  Dorit Donoviel: It's called medication.  Host: OK.  Dorit Donoviel: And like you just said most pharmaceutical companies they don't need this to last that long. They want you to dump it out, so you can buy more, right? In fact, I just put something in the garbage this morning. It expired after a year. So, on the way to Mars as Kristin says, we need to protect those drugs or make them as needed.  Host: I see another benefit too, because that means you may, correct me if I'm wrong, you may have to take less with you. Because now you just have ingredients and you put them together as you need them. So, you don't need this -- a bottle of this, a bottle of that. Now you're limiting mass as well.  Kristin Fabre: And it's a multi-purpose. So, say we went with the plant route. So, we're going to be growing lettuce anyway, well the hope is that we'll have some fresh fruits to be growing. So, can we use plants for multiple purposes and so for nutrition, for CO2, scrubbing for -- can we use them to make our drugs and ingest that way? So, trying to come up with clever ways on how we can use the tools that are on the craft for the needs, for the crew.  Host: Like -- I'm thinking about other applications too. I'm thinking about Earth applications, so what would be nice on Earth to have the build your own pharma kit?  Dorit Donoviel: Yeah so actually this whole idea started at [Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency] DARPA. So, -- Geoffrey Ling who was a former DARPA manager, whose military guy. He was basically deployed in Afghanistan and Iraq. And the biggest problem they had is they didn't have the drugs on-site. They like simple drugs that you would just take for granted here on Earth. In battle, you know where you're -- the farthest corridor of the world it was really hard to get drugs. It would take two or three days to get an antibiotic in. And the person died. So, he was the one that actually initiated what he calls 3D printing of pharmaceuticals and he started a company after he left DARPA and it's actually I think he's partnered up with some folks at either Hopkins or MIT and I apologize for not knowing. But that whole concept of 3D printing is critical because here's the other thing is hospitals right now, they run out of stock. Certain drugs they run out of. And if the manufacturer of generics for example in India or in China, Israel or Canada is behind or there's a shortage, you've got people who are depending on these drugs. You're not able to make them. So, think about it, if you're a hospital administrator and you need to crank out a whole bunch of drugs you can make them right there. So, there's a lot of Earth applications for these things as well.  Host: Very important timely earthy applications is incredible.  Kristin Fabre: And those hard to reach places so some of the places that don't have access to hospitals or healthcare that you can maybe get to the -- get to these communities earlier and quicker to give them their medications.  Dorit Donoviel: We want people to understand that we realize, we're not going to be growing a whole lot of plants on that tiny craft to Mars. It's the concept and maybe we have a Mars colony and maybe there, we can grow not potatoes, but lettuce. We also funded a project that the tomatoes, space tomatoes that are highly miniaturized plant, big fruit but they scrub CO2. So, talk about helping with the green gas. You know becoming a green technology.  Host: Nutrition and for the environment. For the contained environment.  Dorit Donoviel: It's about really you know learning what we can learn about using functional foods, if you will.  Host: Yeah, wow that was just one example that I -- after I asked for examples? [Laughter]  Kristin Fabre: We have a variety. We try to keep our portfolio pretty diverse in terms of how we address the risks that NASA has. We think about cognitive function. We think about radiation. We think about cardio vasculature function and just health. We think about the visual problems that astronauts have. We think about immune. There's -- we have quite a diverse portfolio and we think we need it.  Dorit Donoviel: It's quite humbling because we don't know nearly enough as we should. We know just enough to be dangerous about all these things. [Laughter] Yeah, a couple other examples like Kristin was just mentioning, the ophthalmic issues. So ophthalmic, vision care and making sure that the optic nerve is healthy, and the eyeballs are healthy. And we see this in a lot of the astronauts now and it's not new problem. But we really -- nobody has ever lost vision as a result. We just don't know over three years what will happen. And so again it's that length of time when they go up for a year, in the ISS and they're in zero-gravity. They have change in vision, they have swelling of the optic nerve and they come back to Earth and things get back to normal. We just don't know about three years. Up to three years on that Mars mission, we just don't know. Or, maybe in accommodation with the space radiation, which they're not getting a whole -- I mean they're getting some radiation on the ISS right now, but not nearly what they're going to get on deep space.  Host: And not the right kinds too. [Galactic Cosmic Radiation] GCR’s, all these other things –  Dorit Donoviel: That’s right.  Kristin Fabre: Correct, exactly.  Dorit Donoviel: In combination with that they may have a problem. So, what we've invested in is from ophthalmic technology is do it yourself ophthalmology. OK. So, you stick your eyeball into the viewfinder and that thing will adjust the -- prescription for you so that you can see what you need to see. And it will take a retinal scan of you, basically right now. You need to have another person helping you or an expert to help you align your pupil and everything.  Kristin Fabre: You have to dilate your pupil.  Dorit Donoviel: You have to dilate to get the back of the retina and so that -- do it yourself eye exam that will give you all the information you need. That does not exist today. So, guess where the company is going to take it? CVS and Walgreen. So just like now you have those machines you stick your arm into it and get a blood pressure, you can go in there and do the scan on your eye. Why is this important? There is so many people at risk for losing vision because of diabetic retinopathy. A lot of diabetics -- it's a silent vision killer. You have no idea you have diabetic retinopathy. If your doctor is good they're going to be sending you to an ophthalmologist every year to make sure you're OK. But there are a lot of people with unmanaged or even undiagnosed diabetes. So, what if you go into your Walgreens to pick up the prescription for something an you're in there buying you know a box of diapers, and you go up and you stick your eyeball on this thing, put in ten bucks, or something like that and it says hey your optic nerve is really swollen, and you better go see a doctor. You might lose your vision. So that's going to save a lot of eyeballs. And it's about the technology we're developing for space.  Host: Yeah, yeah but it's -- the theme is all the same when it comes to spaceflight. It's that autonomy, it's that compactness. It's that level of you know you don't need this gigantic machine and these professionals. That's an incredible idea that you can take something that you needed to dilate your pupil. You needed this big machine, you needed a professional standing right in front of you. And you can just put it in like a -- in your corner store.  Kristin Fabre: The user interface is going to be key. We need to make sure that anybody can use these types of technologies, that you do not have to be medically trained to understand how to use the equipment and what the data means when it comes back. So that's one of our priorities and all of the types of technologies that we consider.  Dorit Donoviel: So, talk about scary. So, my son is just finishing med school, he's going to be an orthopedic surgeon, right.  Host: All right.  Dorit Donoviel: Yeah, and so when I talk about do it yourself medicine, it freaks him out, right? Especially surgery. People talk about surgery in space. So, we're going to send a doctor to Mars for sure. Maybe, it will probably be a surgeon or an emergency medicine doctor because they -- they can do the more complicated things. If somebody breaks something, if somebody has to have an emergency appendectomy, if somebody has a foreign particle in the zero-gravity embedded in their airways, what are you going to do? What are you going to do? So, another project we're kind of excited about is working with a game -- a medical gaming company. So, these people came from like Lucas Films and Disney and Pixar. They're developing games for doctor to train them on procedures, so even doctors who learn how to do things get rusty with procedures. And so, they basically create visualization tools. The doctors could even use on their smart phones. You don't have to have a big station, VR headset or anything like that, you can just use it on your smart phone. And you could practice while you're sitting at the airport waiting for your flight. You can practice removing a foreign object from your airways. You can practice doing a scoping. You can practice doing a certain complicated ultrasound scan. And they made these really fun. They're gaming people so they -- and doctors are very competitive so they're competing with each other on how quickly they got this done without killing the patient or, so they made it extremely realistic. It's based on mathematics and the physical model of physiology. They used -- it's not just a game for fun. It's like based in medicine and physiology and a lot of doctors advise them, so we partnered up with them. We gave them some money. We said make this for zero-gravity. What will this look like in zero-gravity? Because fluids behave differently, tissues behave differently. Organs shift in zero-gravity. You have swelling of tissues. An object will float, you can't just put down your you know, scope and it will stay there. It will actually float away. So, you want to simulate that so that when your geologist is having to do a procedure on the doctor, who inhaled some object, now you could practice, you could actually go through this training and have it be realistic in zero-gravity before you have to do this emergency procedure on the doctor who was supposed to be the one that's helping.  Host: Wow, yeah, I could definitely recognize that application for space. But it also makes me feel pretty good to have doctors just on the ground, regularly fine tuning their skills and competing with each other. It's got to feel good from a patient perspective. That they have that dexterity. That familiarization with their motions to -- in case they need to operate on someone.  Kristin Fabre: And what I love about his example is that this is, as Dorit said their background is gaming. They were not trained scientists. They did not go through the university route. This, these are just people that had a tool that if we could modify it for space, it's a game changer. And that's what I love about how we think at TRISH. You don't have to be a traditional scientist that went down a traditional path to engage with us or for us to invest in you. We just want to see a tool that is going to be a game changer. And this is a great example of how that -- how that came to be.  Dorit Donoviel: And talk about educating them. I mean, they have no idea. And so, we brought in astronauts, we brought in flight surgeons, we brought in space physiologists, we brought in people who work at NASA. We brought in people who've been doing this for years together with this group and together you know, they're making something that's going to be useful and fun and engaging and relevant for NASA with real science and physiology behind it.  Host: That's wonderful. Yeah, I like -- when you talk about thinking about new things and new technologies, who would have thought oh let's bring a gaming -- let's bring some gaming folks on to solve this space health problem.  Dorit Donoviel: Do you want to hear something funny? So most of these guys are young, software engineers or gaming people, right? Like you know the type, right? And their families are all like, “you're just a gamer, we don't even take you seriously. You don't really have a real job.” They're like, \"No we're building tools for doctors.\" But as soon as we came in, all of a sudden, they became legit. You're working with NASA, you must be legit. So, we bring legitimacy. [Laughter]  Host: I love that. I think another theme and I kind of want to end with this, what we're talking about when it comes to space health technologies and you've met -- you've had this term a few times. Mars forward, when you're talking about problems for space, it's not just general spaceflight. You're thinking -- you're thinking ahead. You're thinking man if we're on Mars and you're gone and you're far away and you don't have the right communication, 20-minute communication delays. And you're going to be there for an extended period of time. We're talking three years. These are the problems that you're solving. Tell me about like something coming up in the near future, maybe on the Moon where were definitely looking forward to this Artemis program for NASA returning humans to the Moon. What are we looking forward to that maybe we can apply there, and that is truly Mars forward?  Dorit Donoviel: So, I'll start and then Kristin can give the specific example. So that's a great question, so my understanding right now and speaking with NASA and all of our colleagues is that there's so much that's needed to -- so many resources and money and effort to put boots on the ground on surface of the Moon in 2024. That I think using the Moon as an analog for Mars, which is what we were hoping for is to learn how to do the Mars things on the Moon surface where it's more dangerous than ISS, oh heck yeah. But still close enough to Earth that you can have you know, some -- you could have a medical evacuation if you need to, within two days, two three days you'd be back on Earth. But as we understand it, there's just not a lot of capability that's being built right now. And so, everything is about getting the boots on the ground and not having the -- a place where we can do all the testing of the Mars forward things. So, when NASA is ready for that, we will have the tool box, we're developing a future tool box that we can let them have their pick, whatever you guys need here are the things that we want to test on the Moon and that is forward thinking that in terms of Artemis I really -- there's no specific things that we're building for Artemis. But, Kristin has a great idea of how we're going to use Artemis. So, I’m going to let her finish with that. [Laughter]  Kristin Fabre: So, I'm already thinking about the next steps for these tissue chips that I mentioned earlier, so currently we have the organ on chip solicitation that slide. And we want to see if it's good -- a good analog for human tissue and looking at countermeasures. But I'm already thinking about the next steps. So, a lot of these tissues - they can survive for up to 28 days. But I’d like to see is that if we can expand the tissue viability and have everything automated so that these tissues can survive and be viable and functional for up to six months, and I want to launch these guys onto the Moon. And I want to be able to have everything automated so that I can just pick up my phone and say what's the cytokine expression in the tissues right now? So, can I measure inflammation in the vasculature tissue right now? How is the flow? Are these vasculature tissues being leaky? Can I take an image and look at the -- the cell structure or the tissue structure, does it still look OK? And this way it can be a complete non-invasive way of studying human tissue exposed to GCR and in a way that we can -- that we've never done before. And so, this is really my vision for what we can do with these technologies for TRISH is to take this several steps forward and say let's keep these alive for a long time. That's going to take a lot of ingenuity and engineering to say, how do we use the media? Or what the nutrition that's delivered to these tissues? How do we keep that fresh and relevant? How do we automate all of our censors to see what's going on in these tissues? How do we take images and how does that all going to go back to us on Earth where we can look at it on our phone? But that's exactly the type of mission that TRISH has, and this is a vision I think I get most excited about when I think about these types of technologies at our next steps.  Host: Yeah what I love, what I love about everything that you've mentioned so far is your thinking about all of these areas and you're truly doing your best to try and be innovative, to think of brand-new ways and technologies to solve our problems. But, I think what I'm really getting from this conversation is just how excited the both of you are about all of these incredible technologies. It seems like you love your jobs.  Dorit Donoviel: It's the best job ever. And you know NASA is sometimes bogged down with bureaucracy so to be working with NASA and not to be bogged down by the bureaucracy as much as some of my friends are, is a joy. [Laughter]  Host: Yeah, yeah.  Kristin Fabre: But, it’s also I feel like we get to play in a meaningful way. It's sci-fi come to life. And sometimes we joke around saying, “gosh like we need to be inspired, let's put on our favorite sci-fi movie and see if we can pick something up there.” Because it is, it's a way for us to use our imagination. It's a way for us to look at art and say how can this inspire us in our scientists and our space health community to come up with the next step. So of course, this is going to be a great job. It's -- we really do have fun.  Host: Yeah. Well Dorit and Kristin this was so fun. Thank you so much for coming on.  Dorit Donoviel: It's been a pleasure. Thank you so much.  Kristin Fabre: Thanks Gary. Take care.  Host: Yeah - thank you.  [ Music]  Host: Hey thanks for sticking around. Really fun conversation we had with Dorit and Kristin today about TRISH.

                        "description": ">> Houston, we have a podcast. Welcome to the official podcast of the nasa johnson space center, episode 7: total eclipse over america. I m gary jordan and i ll be your host today. So this is the podcast where we bring in the experts-- nasa scientists, engineers, astronauts-- all to tell you the coolest stuff about nasa. So today we re talking about eclipses with mark matney. He s a space debris scientist here at the nasa johnson space center in houston texas, and he also has degrees in astronomy and space physics, and is an avid eclipse aficionado. We had a great discussion about what an eclipse is, some of the history of eclipses, and some of the science that we ve learned and continue to learn from them. This is an exciting conversation, especially because on august 21, 2017, a total solar eclipse will sweep across america. Mark and i talked about where the eclipse will pass through and how you ll be able to see it. They don t happen very often-- the last time a total solar eclipse happened over the states was back in 1991, and we won t see another until 2024. Anyway, we ll get into all that good stuff during this episode. So with no further delay, let s go light speed and jump right ahead to our talk with dr. Mark matney. Enjoy. [ Music ] >> t minus five seconds and counting. Mark. [ Indistinct radio chatter ] >> houston, we have a podcast. [ Music ] >> all right, well, mark, thank you for coming on the podcast today. Perfect timing, because very soon we re going to have a total solar eclipse that s going to pass over the united states. And so i think this is a good chance for us to sit down and talk about eclipses. And you went above and beyond for this one, mark, because you have a lot of different things. I mean, we re talking a lot of science, we re talking a long and detailed history of eclipses. You know, this is not just a, ooh, look at that. Pretty eclipse. No, nasa s going all out for this-- is that fair to say? >> Well, i think this is-- i mean, eclipses have been part of human history as far back as we can record. People have been fascinated, scared, terrified by eclipses. >> Oh, sure. >> And a lot of important scientific discoveries have been driven by eclipses. I think today-- we re doing some science today, but much of the important science was done in the past. But this kind of links us in some sort of way to those early scientists who were trying to puzzle out the mysteries of the universe by using this amazing sight in the sky. So we have some science that s going on, we have some citizen science that s going on, and there s going to be a whole lot of people traveling to see this eclipse. In fact, i was reading that this eclipse is the first cross continent eclipse across the united states since the interstate system was built. >> Oh, wow. >> And so we might see one of the largest migrations of americans in a short period of time that we ve ever seen. [ Laughter ] because there s going to be a lot of people, perhaps tens of millions of people, traveling to see this eclipse. >> That s very true, and they re all going to be, i mean, closer to that nice, thin line-- we re talking about that path of totality, and we ll get into that really shortly, but you know, let s go and start at the very beginning, right? So we re talking about a total solar eclipse-- this is great-- passing over the united states. But what is that? What is a total solar eclipse? >> So a total eclipse is when the disk of the sun is completely covered by the moon. So the moon s size is maybe slightly larger than the sun, so we can get complete coverage. This particular eclipse is going to be about two and a half minutes of totality. Some eclipses are as high as seven minutes. Some of them are just a few seconds. >> And it s just the way things are aligning? >> Well, it turns out that the moon is actually not on a perfectly circular orbit. It s in a slightly elliptical orbit. So sometimes it s a little closer, and sometimes it s a little farther. >> Oh, i see. >> And so [ indistinct ] a little farther, it doesn t quite cover the surface of the sun. And what you end up with is a narrow ring all around. That s called an annular eclipse. And if the moon s a little larger-- in other words, a little closer, it appears a little larger in the sky, you get a total eclipse. And sometimes we actually have what s called a hybrid eclipse where you get an annular eclipse, but the mountains on the moon make it so it s actually a broken ring in the sky. It s so close, because actually, the mountains peeking up cover part of that sun ring. >> So can you see some of the sun peeking through those alleys, i guess? >> That s right, yes. >> Oh, interesting. >> And then that one, turns out if you could get higher in the altitude, in a balloon or plane, you might see a total eclipse in those kinds. But that s a special kind of eclipse that s actually quite rare. >> Wow. >> And then we also have a partial eclipse, and that s what-- it turns out this eclipse is interesting-- as far as i can tell, anyone in any of the 50 united states-- weather permitting-- should be able to see a partial eclipse, including alaska and hawaii. The partial eclipse is where the disk of the moon covers part of the sun but doesn t actually get to-- it s off to one side. >> Okay. >> And so you-- we re going to get a pretty good partial eclipse here from houston, but i think everybody, like i said, somewhere in the united states, one of the 50 states, should be able to see a partial eclipse. >> That ll be cool. >> So by the way, it s august 21st-- we didn t say the date. >> Yeah, so august 21st. And this will come out august 18th, so this ll be like-- >> oh, okay-- perfect. >> This ll be right next to it, yeah, absolutely. So a partial eclipse-- is there-- how-- is there a way that is very apparent to observe that? Like, will the sky get a little bit darker, or-- >> it depends on the percentage. When it s like about 50%, it s hard to notice. But once you get on to 60, 70, 80, 90%, the sky takes on an unusual color. And in fact, that s one of the things i m going to recommend eclipse observers-- just kind of note how the sky changes color, because it s a very interesting phenomenon. >> Yeah. >> But unless it s really-- in ancient times, people did not even notice a partial eclipse unless it was like 80, 90% because they started to see the sun dim, and they would look up at the sun and see there was no longer a disk in the sky. >> Wow. Okay, so from here in houston, what are we expecting percentage-wise? >> Well, i tried-- it s about somewhere around 70%. I don t know the exact area, but there s several tables. Also, that s another thing, is where you are, where the maximum eclipse changes on the clock. So there are computer resources where you can look and put in your location or your city and find out when the maximum eclipse is and how much. >> Oh, okay. Very cool. That s a lot of good stuff. All right, so that s 70%. We ll be able to see-- >> something like 70, yeah. >> A somewhat noticeable change in the sky, then, at least here from houston. That s really cool. So yeah, you said total versus partial. This is the solar eclipse, though, right? >> Right. >> This is when the moon is going in between the earth and the sun. >> Right. >> Like you said, they re relatively the same size in the sky, just based on distance and size, and so it only blocks off this tiny little strip of shadow that s going to go across the united states. And it goes-- you said it happens quite often, but just i guess at different parts of the world. >> Correct. >> It just so happens that it s going to line up this time going from coast to coast. >> And sometimes it s an annular, and sometimes-- but it turns out we get from three to five eclipses, solar eclipses, every year. >> Oh, okay. >> Which is actually kind of surprising. >> We meaning the earth. >> Someone on the earth, in other words, can see an eclipse. We actually have fewer-- there s another kind of eclipse called a lunar eclipse, and the lunar eclipse is when the earth gets between the moon and the sun. >> Right. >> And so as the moon moves into the shadow, it starts to turn dark, and sometimes has an interesting red color. >> Yeah. >> It turns out there are actually fewer of those than solar eclipses. >> Really? >> But because a whole hemisphere can see it, they re much-- you can see them much more often than solar eclipses. >> Oh, that-- okay. >> Because you re looking up in the sky and seeing the moon eclipse, so anybody on that side of the earth can see it-- weather permitting, of course. >> Wow. Why is it that color, though? >> Well, that s an interesting phenomenon. As you know, the sky is blue from the scattering of particles in the atmosphere-- it scatters the blue light. But the red is transmitted just like we see in a red sunset. Well, the earth s atmosphere actually refracts the red light, and so if you were standing on the moon during a lunar eclipse, the earth, of course, would block the sun, but you would see this red ring around the earth, which is the atmosphere refracting the light of the sun. >> So that s the red ring of the earth refracting off the surface of the moon? >> No, no, it s-- the light is coming through the atmosphere and refracting slightly to your position on the moon. >> Oh. >> So you would see this narrow, narrow red glowing ring around the earth. >> Oh, wow. >> So it s-- but of course, no one s ever seen that. >> Yeah. >> Maybe someday when we have a base on the moon. >> Oh, and so wait-- okay, so this is assuming that-- yeah, you re assuming that you are an observer on the moon. >> You re an astronaut standing on the moon, right. >> I see, and there s a red ring. So what about the lunar eclipse-- the perception from the earth? Doesn t a lunar eclipse-- the moon looks a little orange? >> Yeah, it s orange-ish, sometimes. It actually depends on-- it depends on what s happening in the atmosphere. >> Oh, okay. >> For instance, i saw an eclipse in 1982. We were expecting the red moon, but in fact, the moon looked charcoal gray. And that was right after the el chichon volcano in mexico erupted. And so the dust from the volcano had changed the dust in the atmosphere, so we didn t get much red. >> Oh. >> So it actually-- you never know what you re going to see when you see a lunar eclipse, but they re often red. And again, that s the red light that is bent by the earth s atmosphere and shines on the moon. >> Yeah, and it s reflecting-- interesting. So it s all entirely about perception, then, it s about the-- so you re a person on the earth, and this is what you perceive from the perspective of earth. If you were outside floating millions of miles away just observing it from afar, it would just look like the earth and the moon-- the moon wouldn t look a certain color. >> Well, you could see the color, because it s lit up with that color. Let me-- let s change it around. Let s say you were on the moon looking at the earth during a solar eclipse. And we have some photographs from the iss of previous eclipses, and you actually see a-- you can actually see the dark shadow. You can t see the sharp edge of the shadow, but you see this fuzzy black thing on the surface of the earth. And so you would see-- but instead of being the whole earth swallowed up, you just see this black fuzzy spot moving across the earth from space. >> Interesting. >> So hopefully-- it depends on where the iss will be at the time of the eclipse, but hopefully they ll be able to photograph it from-- they probably will not be in the eclipse path, but they could look down on the earth and see the shadow, hopefully, of the eclipse. >> Yeah, i think-- i think they are predicting that the iss is going to be somewhere over canada but will have a nice view of the states whenever it s actually the solar eclipse. >> It would be very, very coincidental if we happened to fly through the shadow, because the shadow is very narrow. It could happen, but i mean-- >> the odds are against us. >> The odds are against us. So a lunar eclipse happens at the full moon. >> Okay. >> When, of course, the sun is on the other side of the earth and the moon is-- if you re standing on the earth, the sun is behind you, because it s nighttime, and you see the-- and a solar eclipse happens at a new moon, when the moon is-- you can t really see it in the sky, because you re seeing the dark side of the moon. >> So you ll never see a crescent moon in a lunar eclipse? >> No, no, it s definitely a full moon, so as full as it gets. Another thing is lunar and solar eclipses are often paired, because that tilt of the moon s orbit, the point when it crosses the earth-sun orbit plane, is on both sides. And so usually we get an accompanying lunar eclipse with a solar eclipse. And in fact, the accompanying lunar eclipse for this eclipse is on august 7th, and will be visible from europe, africa, asia, and australia. >> Oh, okay. Well, there you go. >> Or was visible, i guess. >> August 7th, yeah. I guess-- aw. >> You want me to say that again? [ Laughter ] >> if we could go back in time okay, so i mean, that s kind of from the perspective of earth, right? We ve got solar eclipses, and when the moon is in between us here on earth and the sun, and then the opposite for the lunar eclipse. In general, if you had to give like a general overview, where else in the universe do eclipses happen? >> Everywhere. >> How about that. >> Anywhere where you have bodies moving around, one will often eclipse the view of another. But usually, what you-- you won t get to see the amazing sight on earth, because it s very rare that the object eclipsing looks in the sky the same size as the sun. >> Oh. >> So we know, for instance, there are eclipses caused by jupiter s moons as it orbits jupiter, and you can see the shadow on the surface of jupiter-- or the clouds, actually, of jupiter. >> Right. >> And in fact, there was a fellow named ole r mer-- if i m pronouncing correctly-- back in the 1600s that first detected the finite speed of light by looking at the timing of those eclipses on jupiter. So that s one of those science things that eclipses have allowed us to do. >> That s amazing-- just by looking at shadows across the universe, you can get all this crazy science. >> And sometimes-- i know we ve done occultations of stars, where a planet moves between us and the starlight of a star, and by measuring that star, we ve seen, like-- we ve found the rings of uranus, as the star would twinkle or would blink out just before uranus crossed the star. >> Oh. >> So you can actually do things like look for difficult to see rings, or also, as the light comes through the atmosphere, sometimes you can see the absorption of different chemicals in the atmosphere of the planet. >> And then understand the composition of the planet itself. >> Exactly. >> That s amazing. >> Let me add one thing we hadn t talked about. >> Yeah, sure. >> I found an interesting statistic, and it said that if you picked a random spot on the earth and you just stayed right there, you would see a solar eclipse about once every 375 years, on average. >> Okay, so you should move a little bit. >> Yeah, well-- you re not following. [ Laughter ] so during a normal person s long lifetime-- say, 70 years-- we re looking at a 20-25% chance that you would sometime in your lifetime see an eclipse, a total eclipse of the sun. So yes, it s rare, but not totally unknown. >> Yeah. >> So i just know that one never comes by my house, so i have to go chase it down. [ Laughter ] >> well, that s the great thing, is we have nasa-- we folks at nasa are actually looking at this stuff and making predictions. We know exactly where it s going to be on august 21st. >> That s correct, that s right. >> Yeah, so that kind of will help you see it a little bit, too. [ Laughter ] i think one of my favorites, though, when it comes to eclipses across the universe, is kepler, right? So if you think about-- you said occultations as one of them. That s when something passes in front of a star and changes the light that we re receiving. >> Right. >> That s how we are detecting planets outside of our solar system, correct? >> That s correct, yeah. The kepler mission is looking at a large group of stars and monitoring them constantly. And it has very, very sensitive instruments, so they can look at very small dips in the light as a planet-- a previously unknown planet-- transits the face of that star. And we ve been able-- and when they see them repeating, they can work out the relative sizes of the planets and their period, and work out where they are in orbit around that star. And we ve seen-- i don t know what the count is-- a thousand? >> Yeah, yeah. We keep finding more and more. >> There s a bunch of them. So this is actually one of the most interesting discoveries, i think, astronomers have made in the last several years, is that our galaxy is full of stars with planets. And it s pretty exciting-- it s kind of star trek stuff. >> It is! Especially just recently, the discovery of the trappist-1 system. >> Yes, indeed. >> And those-- we re talking about earth-like planets, and some of which are in what we like to call the goldilocks zone, right? >> That s right. >> And that s-- you know, water doesn t freeze, it doesn t-- >> that s right, it s not too hot, not too cold. >> Not too cold, right, and liquid water can exist. And that s conditions for life, and it s very exciting. >> It is. >> That s what we re looking for, right-- life outside of the universe. >> And i ll also mention we also have transits here, just like what we see with kepler, of the planets mercury and venus, which are inside the orbit of earth. And we recently had a venus transit visible from the us. >> Yeah, 2012, right?? >> That s right, i think it was 2012. And i ve also seen mercury transits as well. Those have an interesting history, because scientists in the 18th century were trying-- they d figured out the relative distance to the different planets, but they didn t know an absolute distance. And they were actually going to use different observers on the earth to measure the transit of venus to try and get an absolute scale. And so that was the cutting edge science in the 18th century. >> Wow. [ Laughter ] >> but so that s another point where transits and eclipses have been an important part of the history of science. >> Amazing. I mean, that s kind of a big theme here, right, especially for eclipses, is the science that we can get from observing these phenomena. >> That s right. >> So i mean, from here on the ground, what are some of the things that we can learn-- and i guess in the instance of a solar eclipse, but you know, eclipses in general-- what are some of the things that we can learn from studying these? >> Well, let s kind of go through some of the discoveries that were made with eclipses. >> Sure. >> So from ecl-- we all look up at the sun and see a bright disk. That s called the photosphere. It s very, very bright, and we ll talk about that a little bit. That s the part we re familiar with. It s about 10,000 degrees fahrenheit-- it s nice and hot. But during eclipses, astronomers notice some red layer-- a thin red layer around the sun. And that s known as the chromosphere. And that was discovered by eclipses, and it turns out chromosphere is due to emissions from atomic hydrogen in the sun s atmosphere. >> Okay. >> And so if you-- the soho spacecraft sometimes show-- i mean-- the soho spacecraft show-- is constantly monitoring the sun. And one of its instruments is a hydrogen alpha filter, and you can see what that chromosphere looks like. It s a very thin layer of the sun, again, that we discovered by looking at eclipses. The next section-- oh, by the way, some scientists-- in 1868, there was a new instrument that was developed called the spectroscope. And the spectroscope splits light into its component colors. And they had discovered that there were specific lines, almost like a fingerprint, that defined-- that were unique to each chemical, to each chemical element. >> Okay. >> And so there were-- some scientists were very excited to use the spectroscope to look at the eclipse. And in the chromosphere, they saw some lines from an element that they had never seen before. And they couldn t figure out what it was. So one of the scientists named it after the greek word for the sun-- helios. They named it helium. >> Oh! [ Laughter ] >> and it was several decades before helium was finally isolated and studied on the earth, but it was first discovered in the sun s atmosphere. >> How about that. That s-- is it called spectroscopy? >> Spectroscopy, yeah. They use a spectroscope for spectroscopy. >> Yeah, yeah, and studying the-- i guess there s little gaps in the light, and they look like gaps in the-- >> sometimes there s bright lines, sometimes there s dark lines. >> Okay. >> It depends on the situation. But the point is these lines are like a fingerprint. And that s how we understand the components of stars millions of lightyears away. We can-- >> so you said photosphere, and then you discovered the chromosphere, right? >> Chromosphere. >> So what s the difference between those? >> Well, the chromosphere is actually a very thin layer-- it s actually-- starts as cooler than the photosphere, and then it heats up again. >> Ooh. >> Solar astronomers are always trying to figure out the exact details, but what gets interesting is when you look up at the eclipse when it s total eclipse, there s what looks like a halo, or a garland, or a crown around it, and that s called the corona. So the chromosphere s a transition between the hot photosphere and the much hotter corona. And the corona is up to-- it s more than 100 times hotter than the photosphere. It s very, very hot. >> Wow. >> And that s, like i said, this halo that you see around the sun. That is actually very important-- to monitor that part of the sun-- in predicting solar storms. >> Oh. >> And solar storms affect things like satellites and our communication and our power systems. And so there are solar astronomers who are constantly monitoring the sun looking for these types of solar storms. But the corona was discovered by looking at eclipses. >> Wow. >> And in fact, it s so important that we ve launched satellites that create artificial eclipses. They put a little obstacle in the way so that we can monitor the chromosphere-- i m sorry, the corona-- at all times. >> So i guess, are they hard to predict, solar storms? >> They re getting better at it. The big thing is they need to be able to see on the far side of the sun. So we ve actually launched a couple of spacecraft called stereo, and they re now on the far side of the sun-- not totally-- they re part way around the earth s orbit, but they can see the other parts of the sun, and we can see storms developing as the sun rotates around. The sun actually rotates, also. >> Wow. So what happens if-- say there s an instance, if there s a solar storm, and it does disrupt satellite communications coverage, whatever it is. What can we expect if that were to happen? Are you talking about cell phones? Are you talking about-- what would happen here on earth? >> Well, one of the worst things we re worried about is a really, really big solar storm which could knock out power grids in certain areas. >> Wow. >> And so you could actually have power outages. >> That s heavy. >> But usually satellites, they put them in safe mode. But it can damage satellites. And as you know, telecommunications is a multi-million dollar business. >> Right. >> So there s a lot of interest in solar storms. >> But they have a safe mode to-- >> yep, that s right. >> That s amazing, okay. So they just put it in there if they see something bad coming. >> It s still dangerous, but they can put it in a safer mode. [ Laughter ] one other thing that was observed during eclipses is there s sometimes these little arcs-- they re not little-- they re bigger than the earth, but these little arcs of plasma jutting off the sun. And you ve probably seen pictures of them. They look like arches or flames coming off the sun. >> Yeah. >> They re called prominences, and they re plasma in the strong magnetic field of the sun moving through the atmosphere. And they re really quite spectacular. >> Yeah, i ve seen some images and videos of them-- they really are. It s amazing. >> Again, those were discovered by eclipses. And i ll tell you another set of experiments. It turned out that by the mid 1800s, scientists had started working out the mathematics of planets, and had noticed when a planet gets perturbed and sort of gets nudged a little bit, they said, well, that must mean another planet that s tugging on it with its gravity. And that s how neptune was discovered. They saw the perturbation in the motion of uranus. And they noticed that there was a slight perturbation in the orbit of mercury. So scientists began speculating that that was due to another planet even closer in to the sun, which they nicknamed vulcan. So what happened was they then sent-- in the 1860s and 1870s, scientists deployed around the world for some eclipses to try and look for vulcan. And they didn t find anything, which puzzled them. They looked at multiple eclipses, multiple times-- no vulcan. But in 1915, albert einstein began publishing-- began communicating his work on the general theory of relativity. And einstein had postulated that gravity is caused by the bending of spacetime. And one of his-- one of his-- one of the predictions of his theory was that you would see this perturbation of the orbit of mercury. So he explained that with his general theory of relativity. But another prediction was that this bending of spacetime would actually bend light. So he showed why there wasn t a vulcan, but then he said, if you look at an eclipse of the sun, and look at the light of stars very, very close to the disk of the sun, you should be able to see the light bent in a way that it displaces the apparent position of the star. In 1919, arthur eddington, the british astronomer, deployed for an eclipse out on an island in the atlantic ocean. And they actually measured this slight change in the apparent position of the stars. And it was a huge event, because when einstein postulated his theory of general relativity, it was crazy. It was overturning newton. And here they actually-- his prediction turned true, and that s sort of what propelled einstein into his fame, was that discovery. So that was perhaps the most important scientific discovery ever during an eclipse, was showing how the light of stars is bent by the presence of the mass of the sun. >> And that-- so it was just the mass of the sun. >> That's right. >> And there was no vulcan. >> No vulcan. [ Laughter ] although, there are two eclipse stories related, sort of quasi-related to the same thing there. >> But everything comes together, right? That s why we re-- like, going back to the general theme here, a lot of science to learn from eclipses. >> A lot of science. Let me talk about a couple things that are going on with the science this time around. >> Okay. >> We have one group that s going to have a series of telescopic cameras set up along the eclipse path. And they re going to try and take video of the inner corona, which is very difficult to see except during the eclipse. And the idea is one camera will record a little segment of the inner corona, and the next camera will record the next segment, and they can stitch them together and have a rather extended video of the corona. >> Oh. >> So for scientists who study the interaction of the corona. Another one is some other scientists are going to be studying the polarization. Some light is polarized in different directions that tells us information about the magnetic fields and other things. But they re going to be looking at the spectrum and the polarization of the-- again, the inner corona, which is difficult to measure in other ways, because it s difficult to get so close-- to measure such dim phenomena so close to the disk of the sun. >> And this is-- going back, i m sorry-- you might ve already addressed this, but these are nasa telescopes, or these are others? >> It s a variety of-- nasa s cooperating on some of these, and some of them are universities, and some of them are amateur. So it s actually a whole team of different kinds of people. >> Wow, okay. >> Nasa s helping to coordinate some of these. >> Yeah, all working together, okay. Cool. >> We ve got another group that are actually going to repeat the general theory of relativity experiment with some more modern digital equipment with more sensitive cameras to look for some very dim stars, again, to try and fine tune those measurements to see how close einstein got to the prediction. >> Wow. >> And then, we also have some radio enthusiasts who are-- during the daylight, the sun ionizes gas in the upper atmosphere and we have an ionosphere. And it, both enhances and sometimes interferes with radio communications. So these scientists are going to look at how the ionosphere changes as the sun gets eclipsed, and the sunlight starts to drop off, and then go back up again. So, they re going to observe how the ionosphere changes. >> Interesting. >> So lots of interesting experiments. And of course-- and many of these are by these amatuer citizen scientists, which is kind of a fun thing, too. >> Yeah, absolutely. So, we re measuring the earth s atmosphere, we re measuring a lot of about the sun. >> Mm-hmm. >> I know out of here, the wb-57, those high altitude planes, they re going to be flying above most of the atmosphere, about 90% of it, and they re going to take a look at the sun and study the sun s corona. >> Yeah, a bit. >> And measure how energy goes through the sun s atmosphere, but then also take a look at mercury. >> Oh, that s right. >> Yeah. >> I wanted to tell you, when you see the eclipse you will see a number of planets visible in the sky. >> Oh. >> So, if you get a chance, you ll see stars. Venus is off to the west, mars is even closer. It s-- venus is about 35 degrees to the west, mars is about 10 degrees to the west, mercury s about 10 degrees to the east, and jupiter s way over on the other side of the sky at 60 degrees to the east. And the star, regulus, which is a bright star, will be about 5 degrees to the east of the sun, so you can see if you can see that. >> And this will happen during totality, right? >> During totality, because the stars will come out. >> Wow, amazing. So you ll be able to see all of these, and you re talking about from the perspective if you re looking up and-- the sun-- >> right. >> Once it goes to totality-- and we can get to safety in a minute, but i do know, once it gets to totality you can take off your glasses for about that two minutes, right? >> That s right. Yeah. >> And then, that s when you ll be able to see all those different parts. >> Yes. >> That s really cool. >> Yeah, that s it. Let s talk a little about the history, because there s some interesting history, of course. >> Sure, yeah. >> The most famous story, which is probably legendary, but the story about a chinese astronomer, or possibly two chinese astronomers, named xi he, who was hired by the king. He was the high astronomer, the head astronomer. >> Mm-hmm. >> To make predictions about primarily with astrology to make sure that nothing bad was going to happen to the king. Well, apparently there was a solar eclipse he did not predict. >> Oh. >> And apparently, he had had a little too much to drink and he wasn t on the job when the time came. >> Oh. >> And the chinese actually thought, and a lot of ancient cultures thought, that something bad was happening. The chinese thought a dragon was swallowing the sun, and they would bang on pots and pans to scare the dragon away. And that s actually still practiced in many parts of the world, the bang on pots and pans. >> Yeah, they don t know the-- like, the science behind this total solar eclipse, so they re-- >> that s right. >> Yeah, right, go ahead. >> I think part of this tradition is passed on. >> Yeah, tradition, yeah. >> Well, unfortunately, this poor chinese astronomer that didn t do his job, he got executed. >> Oh. >> So, fortunately, we don t hold our scientists to this same level there. >> I m very thankful of that. >> Yes. >> I m sure we are. Yeah. >> But, lots of ancient people were scared of eclipses because they thought they-- i mean, it s a very amazing thing to happen in the sky and they were worried about it. It s warning of some tragedy. >> Mm-hmm. >> So early scientists in multiple cultures-- the mayans, the babylonians, the chinese-- studied eclipses and tried to understand and predict when they would occur. It turned out there was a greek by the name of thales who predicted an eclipse in 585 b.c. And this was recorded and the greek historian, herodotus, there was a big battle going on between two countries. There were the medes and the lydians, in what s now turkey. >> Hmm. >> And there was a war going on and they had lined up for battle. And they were about to do battle and suddenly there was a solar eclipse. >> Oh. >> Os, needless to say, the two generals met in the middle of the field and said, maybe we ought not to fight today. And so they drew up a peace treaty and those two countries never fought again. So just a-- >> all right. So an example of solar eclipse saving lives. >> That s right. Indeed, indeed. And so, but what happened was, a lot of these-- as people began to learn to write things down-- the babylonians on clay tablets, and the chinese court records, and the greek historians-- people began to pull together this information to understand how to predict eclipses and understand how the cycles occur. And that helped the-- that sort of spawned the whole science of astronomy. How do you-- how d the mathematics occur on these objects. >> Hmm. >> And one of the things they discovered was called the saros cycle, and this actually-- edmond halley named it the saros cycle. They didn t-- they had different names in ancient times. But what they discovered was that an eclipse will recur approximately every 6,585.3 days, which is 18 years, 11 days, and 8 hours. So it turns out that the eclipse we re about to have is part of a saros cycle that occurred-- the last one was in europe in august 11, 1999, and the next one will be in asia and the pacific one september 2nd, 2035. And it looks almost exactly the same except shifted by 8 hours around the other, 123 degrees in longitude. >> Oh. >> So these repeating cycles were how the ancients were able to predict eclipses. >> How about that. Wow. >> And it s just all the different cycles of the sun and the moon add up to this repeating cycle of eclipses. >> Interesting. >> Another thing that science that was done in ancient times was the greeks looked up at a lunar eclipse-- when we re talking about how the moon moves into the shadow of the earth. And what they discovered is when the moon is near the horizon and eclipsed the shadow of the earth is not a line, if the earth were flat. It s still round. So the greeks realized that the earth must be a sphere based on-- based on the shadow of the earth on the moon under an eclipse. >> Oh, wow. >> So that was the first scientific discovery that the earth was indeed a sphere. >> Back in the mayan-- wow, okay. >> Back in the greek times, that was. >> Oh, that was greek times. >> Yeah, it was. >> Okay, okay. Interesting. Wow! >> There s a lot of interesting history associated with eclipses. >> Absolutely. >> That-- so we ve learned a lot through history. I mean, we re talking about, yeah, the shape of the earth. We re talking about-- it stopped a battle. >> Nature of the sun, yeah. >> The nature of the sun. >> Yup. The earliest eclipse that was-- that, as far as we know, was recorded, that chinese eclipse was probably about 2000 b.c. And there was maybe the one in 2137 b.c. But, the one we re sure about was there was an eclipse recorded in the town of ugerit, or ugarit, on-- in what is now, i believe, syria. >> Hmm. >> It was may 3rd, 1375 b.c. It was recorded that the sun grew dark. >> Oh. >> So there s a number of those recorded in ancient texts and tablets. >> Okay. So, wait, so the chinese one was not recorded? It was just-- >> well, just know it s actually probably semi legendary. We re not sure. >> Got it, okay. >> But this is the one we know for sure we can date the eclipse. >> Yeah. >> And actually-- oh, that was what i was going to tell you, is we have a number of these dated eclipses-- eclipse of thales, we talked about. >> Mm-hmm. >> Eclipse in ugarit. And what happens if you just run-- if you just take your computer models and putting gravity and everything and just run the sun and moon backwards in time, it turns out the eclipse is in the wrong place. So, from that, what we ve learned is that the earth rotation very, very gradually starting to slow down. >> Hmm. >> Starting to, it s been a long time. It s mainly due to the tidal effects of the moon. It s actually dragging the earth slightly down. So it s actually in those several thousand years the earth has slowed down a little bit, a fraction of an-- a fraction of a rotation. >> Oh. >> But, keep in mind, we re talking about-- we re talking about 800,000 rotations or something like that since those times. And so, we ve-- the earth s rotation has changed just a little bit in those times. But, that s another discovery we ve made that you need that long time scale to see this very gradual slowing down of the earth s rotation. >> So, over that long period of time, you said a fraction of a day, is it like an hour? Couple of hours? >> A couple of hours i think, yeah. >> Wow. >> But, and recently, some scientists have gone back and looked at chinese records, and again, been able to fine tune that. So that s a-- that s using ancient records to fine tune some modern science, so. >> All right. Cool. Okay, so let s go to this eclipse coming up on the 21st. >> All right, do you want to talk about safety or what to expect? >> All of it. Let s do it. >> All right. All right, let s talk about-- >> however you want to start. >> Let s talk about safety a little bit. >> Okay, safety. >> Okay, everybody has heard, don t look at an eclipse, you ll go blind, right? We ve all heard that. >> Yeah. >> And i remember as a boy, puzzling and puzzling over that. What is it about an eclipse that makes it so dangerous? >> Mm-hmm. >> Well, it turns out, you don t want to stare at the sun ever. It s bad for your eyes. Your eyes are not designed to be-- handle direct sunlight for any length of time. >> I feel like it s a good general rule. >> It s a good general rule. And when our kids go outside, we say, now, kids, don t look at the sun, you ll go blind. It s true, you don t want them looking at the sun. >> Yeah, yeah. >> The reason why-- the eclipse is not any different. It s just you're more likely to stare at the sun during an eclipse because you want to see what s happening. >> Oh. >> So, this really-- there s people that think there is some sort of mysterious rays coming off the sun. The only thing is just the sun like we're normally familiar with, you just don t want to stare at it. Okay. >> Okay. >> All right, so that s the first thing. So any time the bright disk, that photosphere of the sun, any time the bright disk is visible, even just a little sliver, you really don t want to look at the sun with your unaided eye. It s dangerous. You want to keep your eye for a long -- your eyes for a long time, right? >> Yeah, i would hope so. >> But we have special-- nowadays, we have special eclipse glasses that you can get in museums and different places. >> Yeah. >> That are-- it s perfectly safe to put those on and look. By the way, don t do what i did. I was checking my eclipse glasses the other day. I looked up at the sun, i said, yeah. And i pulled the eclipse glasses off before i stopped looking at the sun, so then i had a bright blob. Just for a second, i had a bright blob in my eyes for a little while. So be careful with them. They re often made of aluminized mylar and they look-- they re kind of silvery. >> Okay. >> And also, don t put any pinholes or anything in them. That-- you want to-- you want to keep them like they are. >> Keep them-- so what are the special eclipse glasses? They have-- they re just like really intense sunglasses? Is that kind of what i think? >> Yeah, it s kind of super sunglasses. >> Okay. >> Which here s the thing, you want to avoid any homemade glasses. >> Oh. >> Don t put on multiple sunglasses or something. Don t use smoked glass, or photographic film, or neutral density filters, or anything like that. You re not sure there s enough there to block the light to make it safe. >> Okay. >> So stick with the-- with the-- with the kind that you can get. They re not very expensive and you can-- you can get them online and other places. >> Okay. >> One exception is number 14 welder s glass is safe, because that s designed also for very bright. Like the welders use. >> Oh, okay. >> All right, so that s okay. And the-- and even more important part is don t look at the sun-- don t look at the bright disk of the sun with any instruments, with telescopes or binoculars without proper filters on them, because those things actually magnify the strength of the sun. >> Ooh. They ll your-- >> and just like when i was a boy, i used to use the magnifying glass on the ants, you know? That could do that to your eye, so you need to be very, very careful. >> Yeah. >> So i would avoid-- i would avoid those, unless you have properly designed equipment. Now, don t like take your binoculars and put your sunglasses at the eyepiece, because it s so intense it could burn right through your special glasses. So there s-- be very, very careful unless you know what you re doing with binoculars and telescopes. Don t even use those. >> Right, and that s, again, that s only a two minute eclipse. >> It s only a two and a half minute at the most. >> Yeah. >> So, that s-- that little window of time during totality, after the moon has completely covered the disk of the sun-- >> mm-hmm. >> --That is the only time you can look safely without glasses. >> Okay. >> And it-- and the brightness of the-- of the eclipsed sun and the corona-- it s like the brightness of a full moon, so there s no dangerous rays. You just don t want to be staring at the sun when the sun re-emerges. So, okay. So, just good rules of thumb. >> So, when you re looking at it-- say you have the glasses on. >> Mm-hmm. >> Is there a specific amount of time that we can say is safe to have the glasses on and be looking at the moon about to cover the sun? >> Well, what s going to happen-- >> you don t want to stare at it for hours. >> No, no. Well, what you re probably looking for is as the sun-- as the very last piece of the sun starts to disappear, you ll see actually little dots that form, and those are called baily s beads. >> Hmm. >> And it s an interesting phenomena of what-- it has to do with the different brightnesses on the edge of the sun, and also the mountains on the moon. >> Mm-hmm. >> When those disappear, that s the time you can take your glasses off and-- so you don t want to be-- because that s actually tiny little pieces of the photosphere of the sun. >> Right. >> Oh, there s the other way-- if you don t have the glasses, there s some other ways you can look at-- and it s-- by the way, if you re seeing a partial eclipse, you just want to use the glasses. You don t want to look at the sun directly. >> Will you be able to see the moon partially covering the sun with the glasses? >> Yes, it ll look like a cookie with a bite taken out of it. >> How about that. That s cool. >> That s pretty cool. One method you probably heard of is a pinhole projector, and it s very easy to make. You need some opaque material, like cardboard, and you make a pinhole, and then you project onto like a white sheet of paper an image of the sun. A pinhole acts like a lens. And i think it s important, don t actually look through the pinhole with your eye. It s not intended to look inside. It s a projector. It s a little projector. >> You look at the paper. >> You look at the paper and you ll see a little image of the sun with that. And you can see the progress of the eclipse. Another method i used to do when i was in high school, is if you take a very small mirror or a large mirror with a piece of paper with a circular hole cut out, and you can reflect the image on the sun-- of the sun onto a shaded wall, and you can watch the eclipse that way. >> Oh. >> And i tell the story, i was in-- i was in history class when there was an eclipse of the sun when i was in high school, and i asked the teacher, i said, is it okay if i put this in the window and we can watch the eclipse during class time? The teacher said, okay. So we put it in the window and it put an image of the sun during the eclipse up on the ceiling. We just went along with class and you could watch the progress of the eclipse. >> All right. >> So those are-- so the mirror, there s the projector, or your glasses are the three ways to watch the eclipse. And then, the only time, again, to watch the sun-- watch the eclipse unaided is during totality, that little short period of time. >> Okay, and totality is by far the most narrow section of the u.s. >> That s right. >> So you really have to be in that spot and we-- you can go to the website eclipse2017.nasa.gov and find out exactly where that s going to be passing through. >> That s right. And it starts-- i think i started this, but it comes on the west coast. >> Oh, right. >> It arrives in oregon, it goes across oregon, idaho, wyoming, nebraska, missouri, kentucky, tennessee, south carolina. It s a nice path that goes right through the middle of the united states. >> All right. >> And it s a relatively narrow-- relatively narrow path and, of course, it s actually moving. It s a round shadow that s moving across the surface of the earth. >> Mm-hmm. >> And if you re actually anywhere in that band you will see a total eclipse. The closer you are to the center, the longer it will last. Up to a max of two and a half minutes. >> All right. >> The other thing though is the weather. >> Oh, yeah. >> Yeah. So, it turns out that what eclipse aficionados like to do is they ll look at the historical weather at that point in the u.s. At that time of year and it turns out some of the areas are more likely to have-- to have clouds than others. So it turns out, eastern oregon is a really good place. They tend to have nice clear weather at that time of year. >> Okay. >> Wyoming, nebraska, missouri, all the way to tennessee, tend to be pretty cloud free at that time of year. And then, there s another-- as it goes over the appalachians, they tend to be cloudier. And then the little section of south carolina will also have, hopefully, less clouds than other places. But again, you never know. It;s the weather. >> Yeah. Oh, yeah. >> All you can do is roll the dice and figure-- and hope that you re lucky, because if-- there have been many eclipses that people have gone-- scientists have gone specific trips to see and it s been interfered-- the weather interferes. >> Yeah, that s just-- yeah, poor luck. But that s based on data of this day over time at this place. >> That s right. How often has it been cloudy on this day at this place. >> Yeah, and so you re really rolling the dice, but playing the odds. But those based on statistical data are better off than others. >> Right. >> Very cool. Is there any particular spot during the path of totality that may be would be better? Like, for example, is it better to go to like a state park and be away from city lights or anything? Or is being in the city just as fine? >> It s just as fine. >> Okay. >> It doesn t get totality dark during an eclipse. >> Okay. >> It gets dark, but i don t think that s-- i don t think that part of it is particularly important. >> Okay. >> The main thing, it s actually much more practical, you want to be somewhere where you re close to restrooms. >> Okay. >> The eclipse itself lasts three hours and there may be a lot of traffic, so the ability to get around maybe limited. >> Ooh, yeah. >> So, just very practical things-- are you close to food> are you close to supplies? Things like that. >> Mm-hmm. >> So let s talk a little bit about what to expect. >> Yeah. >> As i said, there may be a lot of heavy traffic so you want to get to where you want to go early. >> Okay. >> And bring things that you re going to need-- your glasses-- your eclipse glasses, a camera if you re going to bring a camera, chairs, sunscreen, water, food, toilet paper, anything that you think you might need while you re on the road. >> Wow, yeah. >> I once had to evacuate here in houston during hurricane rita, and it s maybe a little bit like that and may be stuck on the road with heavy traffic if you re not careful. >> Wow! Are you talking about people stopping on the highway just to-- >> no, just talking about large numbers of people moving to see the eclipse. >> To see-- to be in the path of totality. >> If you re traveling-- for instance, i m going to be in the carolinas. >> Mm-hmm. >> And every eclipse watched on the atlantic coast is going to be headed for south carolina. >> Yeah. >> So the interstates are going to be pretty full. >> Wow. >> So just allow plenty of time. The total eclipse-- i mean, the entire eclipse lasts about three hours, so it s about an hour and a half leading up to totality and an hour and a half until the moon completely uncovers the sun. >> Okay, okay. >> But again, i-- and one of the things i thought was interesting was the eclipse veterans gave some very sage advice. They said, if this is your first eclipse, don t try to photograph it. Don t try to take telephotos of it. You ll be so worried about your camera, you ll miss the spectacular nature of the eclipse. So i think that s good advice. And so, if you re a veteran eclipse guy and you want to-- and you want to make photographs of things, that s fine. >> Yeah. >> Let the professionals do it. Just enjoy the experience. >> Yeah. >> I think that s a good idea. >> I m sure there s going to be plenty of imagery coming out from all over the u.s. >> Oh, there will. I bet there s going to be lots of selfies with people with the moon and the eclipsed sun behind them. But that s fine. >> Do you think selfies will come out, at least during totality? Maybe when it s dark enough it ll be okay. >> You may need a flash on yourself. >> Oh, okay. A flash on yourself, okay. >> A couple of suggestions to do, so a little citizen science you can do. >> Okay. >> One of them is, notice how the sky colors change. >> Hmm. >> They re very unusual colors that you don t normally see, so that s an interesting thing. Also, when there s a tree casting shadows, there are lots of little tiny holes between the leaves that act like pinhole cameras. So sometimes you can see little crescent suns during the partial eclipse on the ground. So you can look for that. It s kind of fun to take pictures of that. >> Oh, that s really cool. >> Does the temperature change? Does it feel cooler during the eclipse? Does the wind pick up or calm down during the eclipse? Just some kind of scientific things you can observe. >> Just is there-- are there things that we know of that-- what atmospheric changes in the earth? Like-- >> it will-- it does change the heating of the earth from the sun. >> Oh, it does? >> Yeah, and you will feel colder. And people actually have noticed it feels considerably cooler, which will be pleasant probably on august 21st, especially in south carolina. So just things to notice. Again, the other thing is as totality approaches observers have sometimes noticed what s called shadow bands, and these are alternating light and dark bands that quickly move across the ground, especially where you have light colored surfaces. >> Hmm. >> They occur just before totality and after totality. They re-- actually, we don t fully understand how they work. They probably have something to do with the atmosphere, the same reason the stars twinkle. But if you can see them-- sometimes they re seen, and sometimes they re not. Something to look for. >> Hmm. >> Another thing to observe is right a s the totality is beginning, there s just a tiny little sliver of the sun, and it looks very much like a diamond ring in the sky, and it s called the diamond ring effect. And that s definitely when the diamond ring occurs at the end of the eclipse. So the baily s beads-- that s the time to put your sunglasses-- your special eclipse glasses back on. >> Oh, okay. >> But, as the eclipse is about to happen you ll see the diamond ring effect, and then the diamond will go away, the baily s beads will go away, and then you ll see the full totality. And again, you can take your eclipse glasses off during totality, but be ready to put them back on. >> Yeah. >> And another thing you can look around is take a moment-- while you re enjoying the eclipse, take a moment to observe people around you. See how people react to it. >> Yeah. >> The expressions on their face. Another thing, is sometimes animals behave strangely during eclipses. >> Chicken shave been known to roost, birds behave differently. Even wasps and bees sometimes behave strangely. >> Wow. >> Cows, insect-- dogs, insects, anything you can think of that s close by, just for fun, observe and see if you notice anything. >> It is a strange and rare phenomenon to them. >> It is strange and they re confused by it. >> Yeah, yeah. >> And by the way, after totality, the whole sequence will reverse it. So you have all those sequence of things, the partial eclipse, the diamond ring, the baily s beads. >> Mm-hmm. >> And that will reverse as the moon uncovers the sun. >> Wow. Amazing. >> So if you miss this eclipse, or the weather doesn t cooperate, we have another chance in 7 years from now. >> All right. >> In 2024, there will be an eclipse that will move through texas and up through new england, and it will be another total eclipse of the sun. So we have two in a very short period of time, but it s been a long time since we ve had an eclipse. >> All right, yeah. >> So, we re due. We re due. We get two-- so, two chances, and my wife said, well, why don t we just go to the one in 7 years? And i said, well, we don t know what our lives are going to be like in 7 years. >> Yeah. >> So i said, carpe eclipsum. Seize the eclipse. So this is your chance. >> Fantastic. Yeah, no, i mean, i m-- if anything, why not both, right? >> Well, why not? We can try both. I may become an eclipse junkie, i guess. >> Yeah, yeah. No, i mean, it s so cool. And the fact that we re able to predict them, and we can go and-- we have a bunch of best practices on how you can observe the eclipse, the best that you can possibly do it. >> Yeah. >> I know, going back, just one quick thing. Well, you said early. Arrive to your destination early. >> Yeah, if you can, yes. >> How early are you-- are you talking about like days, or day, or hours? >> Well, it s difficult to arrive days early now, because virtually every hotel is booked along the eclipse path. >> Oh. >> We re going to be some distance away from the eclipse, so we re going to have to start early. The eclipse is maximum in south carolina about 2:30, so i figure if we get off at 8:00 in the morning that gives us about 6 hours to get there. And that may or may not be enough time. We ll just have to do the best we can. That was just where we-- i m staying with relatives, so that s-- >> okay. >> But, a lot of people i know have their hotel rooms booked in the-- at-- underneath the eclipse, so they can just step outside and watch it. >> Yeah, that s the-- oh, i wish i planned ahead there. That would ve been nice just get a nice, like, resort or something and just lay by the pool, watch the eclipse go by. That d be pretty cool. >> Actually, what i had originally planned-- i ve been planning for this eclipse since i was in graduate school many, many years ago. >> Wow. >> And i noticed that it would actually go through grand teton national park. And i thought, that s what i ll do. I ll go to the grand tetons and see the eclipse. But it turns out, the weather s not so-- it s a higher probability of clouds there, so i backed away from that. >> Wow. >> Good luck to those of you that-- the tetons. But that would be a beautiful photograph, actually, to see the eclipse over the grand tetons. >> Oh, absolutely. Let s keep our fingers crossed for that good weather all across the board. >> Hopefully it ll be clear all across the united states. >> Yeah. >> And everybody will be able to enjoy the eclipse. >> That would be fantastic. Well, i think that s all the time we have, unless you have one more story. But-- anything? >> I have other stories, but-- there are lots of good stories. >> Well, hey, yeah. Actually, we have a website and if you stay tuned until after the music here, we ll tell you where you can go and check out some more info on the eclipse and learn a little bit more about the history, the science, and all kinds of cool stuff, including the citizen science that mark was talking about here and how you can-- what you can do to observe some phenomena about this eclipse. So stay tuned for after the music there. Mark, thank you so much for coming on the podcast today. >> You re welcome. >> I feel like that was-- i m not going to say everything about the eclipse, because like you said, there s definitely more. But that s the-- i feel like i have a good understanding about eclipses and the science that goes behind it. So there s a lot about eclipses and a lot that we can learn just from shadows, and it s just amazing that there s so much behind it. So thanks for coming on the podcast and talking all about it. And everyone, i hope you enjoy the eclipse on the august 21st. So thanks again, mark. >> Thank you. [ Music ] >> houston, go ahead. >> I m on the space shuttle. >> Roger, zero-g and i feel fine. >> Shuttle has cleared the tower. >> We came in peace for all mankind. >> It s actually a huge honor to break the record like this. >> Not because they are easy, but because they are hard. >> Houston, welcome to space. >> Hey, thanks for sticking around. So, once again, this monday, august 21st, a total solar eclipse will sweep across america. If you want to know all the information that we have, if this podcast was not enough for you, go to eclipse2017.nasa.gov. You can find out all the science of eclipses, even more than we talked about with mark matney today, where it will be, and then how to safely view it from the ground. Just be sure to make sure that you check the glasses and make sure that they are nasa certified. After talking with mark matney after the show, we found out that the shadow itself is going to be 68 miles wide, and then that shadow travels faster than 1,000 miles per hour. So, he went back and he was trying to find the width of the shadow. It s actually a little bit smaller than you would imagine, but how fast it travels-- i mean, we re talking about some of those planes that are going to be following the shadow and studying it, they re only going to get only a few extra minutes out of it because the shadow s traveling so fast. But, if you think about it, it s the moon going around the earth, so it s probably going to be a little bit faster than you would think. Anyway, you can find out more about the eclipse by following us on social media. Obviously, our nasa accounts will be talking about this, but also here at the nasa johnson space center you can follow our accounts there. We ll be talking about it. If you follow international space station you can see some of the imagery. You ll get from there 250 miles above the earth. And then also, aries astral materials research, you ll find them on multiple accounts and you can talk-- they will be talking mostly about the science of eclipses, and they are also based here in the johnson space center. All of these are on either facebook, twitter, and instagram. If you want to join the conversation for-- and maybe submit some pictures that you are taking from wherever you re going to be observing the eclipse, and then also sort of see what everyone else is doing, the official hashtag for this event is #eclipse2017. Just use that on your favorite platform and share your experience and maybe ask a couple questions in case all of the information we told you today and anything you can t find on the website we can still answer even more questions that you have. So this podcast was recorded on july 19th, 2017. Thanks to alex perryman, john stoll, and tracy calhoun. And thanks again to dr. Mark matney for coming on the show. We ll be back next week."

                        "description": "Pat Ryan (Host): Houston, we have a podcast.  Welcome to the official podcast of the NASA Johnson Space Center, Episode 85, Space City.  I'm Pat Ryan.  On this podcast, we talk with scientists, engineers, astronauts, lots of other folks about their part in America's space exploration program.  Today we're focusing on how the presence of one NASA field center here in Houston impacts the community in which it resides and vice-versa.  When President Kennedy set his moon landing goal back in 1961, NASA decided that the group that was leading human space flight efforts needed its own location.  The requirements were that it be at least 1000 acres, in a moderate climate with established electric and water utilities, close to commercial jet service and to water transport that could accommodate large barges, that it have an established industrial complex with available labor, be close to institutes of higher education, and have a culturally attractive community.   The site that ultimately was selected was 25 miles southeast of downtown Houston, which in the 1960 Census had a population of 938,000 people, just a little behind Baltimore and about 60,000 ahead of Cleveland.  The site actually wasn't even inside the Houston city limits.  A map from 1961 shows that the only things interesting enough in the immediate area to be marked were a county park and the Houston Girl Scout Camp, which was located pretty much where I'm sitting today.  It was 1000 acres of land that had been donated by the Humble Oil Company to Rice University which the school was leasing out to graze cattle and which it was willing to make available to the government to bring what was then known as the Manned Spacecraft Center to Houston.  The people started working in leased office and laboratory space all over town while the buildings were built.  The new center officially opened in September 1963, 18 months before the first manned flight of the Gemini program.   Things around here have changed a lot since then.  Joining me to talk about the relationship between NASA and the local community in Houston are ¬¬Cindy DeWease, the President and CEO of the Clear Lake Area Chamber of Commerce; William Harris, President and CEO of Space Center Houston; and Bob Mitchell, President of the Bay Area Houston Economic Partnership.  So here we go.    [ Music ]    Host: Let me start by asking each one of you to give me an elevator pitch about what your organization is and the role in this community.  Alphabetically, let's start with Cindy DeWease.    Cindy DeWease: Okay.  Well, I am the president and CEO of the Clear Lake Area Chamber of Commerce and we started in 1962 with the Seabrook business community and the Kemah business community wanting to start a business organization, membership organization because the government was coming.  Manned Spaceflight Center was being built and they felt like they needed to get their act together.  And so the chamber of commerce started in those communities.  Two years later, League City joined -- The business community of League City joined that effort and they became the Clear Lake Chamber of Commerce based on the name of the lake.  And then as the community grew and more cities formed that went around the lake and we now represent nine different cities in portions of two counties and we have about 900 members.  And as I said, we are a business organization.  Our focus is on economic development and advocacy and with that, though, networking has formed because people want to do business with people they know, like and trust.  And so joining the chamber of commerce having a common goal with the other members helps you get to know folks and build your business network.  So in a nutshell, that's what the chamber is all about.    Host: Terrific.  William Harris, Space Center Houston is what?    William Harris: Well, Space Center Houston is a dynamic learning destination.  We are a science center that focuses on space exploration specifically interpreting human space exploration and we're also the official visitor’s center for NASA Johnson Space Center.  So we came about, about 26 or so years ago as the outcome of the various NASA research centers talking about how to better manage visitors because it used to be you could just walk on to the facility at NASA Johnson Space Center, go into any kind of laboratory or area but we now live in a post-9/11 world where you have to manage visitors who come into your facilities, particularly a secure federal facility.  And so we have grown to be the top destination in Houston for out of town visitors welcoming over 1.1 million visitors a year and we're continuing to grow.  We've recently gone through an extensive strategic planning process to really look at how do we manage that growth because we're kind of busting at the seams of the number of people coming through and in part I think it's a reflection of the public's renewed interest in space exploration and excitement about what's going on.   We also offer very robust education programming.  That's a major area of growth and service to the community.  We now welcome over 250,000 youth and educators on field trips every year and that number is continuing to expand.  We offer classes for people of all ages.  One of our best known one is called Space Center University which is a one-week deep engineering emersion for visitors ages 11 through college.  And so based on your academic level, you have an incredible experience in the course of a week to understand what goes into working in the space program.    Host: I did not know that Space Center Houston was the top visitor destination of the whole area.    William Harris: Yes.  Yeah, we receive more out of town visitors than any other destination in the Houston region.    Host: Historical note.  Before there was Space Center Houston, the visitor’s center was right here in this room where we are sitting today.  This used to be where space capsules were on display and where I came when I was nine.    Bob Mitchell: Interesting.    Host: Bob Mitchell, the Bay Area Houston Economic Partnership.    Bob Mitchell: Yeah.  Thank you.  The Bay Area Houston Economic Partnership is a 501(c)(6) nonprofit organization.  We just started our 43rd year.  We're a completely member driven organization.  We have about 270 members.  Thirteen cities fund us, two counties, Harris and Galveston County, Port of Houston, Houston Airport system.  We have 43 aerospace companies that are members of the organization, about 22 financial institutions, about 16 healthcare institutions, six specialty chemical companies.  We have some brokers, some developers.  I tell everybody, you got to have a few lawyers.  Very little retail.  We have some retail like Minuteman Press and My Flooring America who have been members since the beginning of the organization.  What we do is we recruit companies to the region.  It may be from North Texas, South Texas or it may be from Alaska, it may be anywhere.  We recruit companies here.  We do a lot of retention work.  Retention is defined about a lot of the work that I do for the Johnson Space Center is I tell people I can say things and ask for things that they can't ask for themselves.   So I do a lot of retention work.  And then the other thing is expansion projects.  We recently worked expansion projects.  Conoco was a $500 million expansion project.  LyondellBasell was a $1.2 billion expansion project.  What does that mean?  These companies are global.  They can do work anywhere in the world.  They can expand their operations anywhere.  They're global companies.    Host: They need a reason to do it here.    Bob Mitchell: Absolutely.  So what we do is we give them a reason.  What we do is we put financial packages together based on incentives maybe from the city, from the county, from the state, workforce training dollars, pull all of that together, abatements and say here, this is, we'll give you this if you do that $500 million expansion project here.    Host: Tell me -- Narrow it down for me just a little and tell me how you do that work that is directly with NASA and the Johnson Space Center on a regular basis.    Bob Mitchell: Well, once a month, I meet with the center director and have been meeting with the center director since Beak Howell and we go over issues that they have and I try to find a way to help them out.  That's basically what it is and of course I work very closely with Debbie Conder and Arturo Sanchez, a number of people within NASA.    Host: Yeah.  And those are the people who lead the external relations office at JSC today.  Can you give me an example or two of what sort of things does the NASA Johnson Space Center look to you to assist them with?    Bob Mitchell: To help the federal government to make sure that they're fully funded in their budgets.  I work on the budgets quite often and again, you know, as a NASA contractor or a NASA employee, you can't ask for money but that doesn't mean I can't ask for money.  So I'm that mechanism that helps them, you know, to receive the funding that they need in the right programs.    Host: Cindy, in your case, how does the chamber of commerce work with NASA and JSC?    Cindy DeWease: Well, we also have Debbie Conder on our Board or she reports to our Board once a month, so she brings us news from NASA, what's going on at JSC specifically at JSC and so we keep abreast of what's going on in that area but we also, I go to annually on a trip that BAHEP actually started and organized as citizens for space exploration and that is a trip to Washington, DC, where we take about 100 folks and or BAHEP organizes it.    Host: And BAHEP is Bob Mitchell's organization.    Cindy DeWease: Bob Mitchell's organization, and I'm fortunate to be involved in that and asked to participate in that and that is just going around and talking to our congressmen and our senators about the importance of space exploration, specifically human space exploration and how that, it drives, is an economic driver for these communities and for the entire US.  And so it's important to our economy but it's important to the citizens of our country as well.    Bob Mitchell: Can I comment on that one particular trip?    Host: Sure.    Bob Mitchell: That one particular trip we started 24 years ago and we started because the International Space Station passed by one vote.  At that time, we took six travelers from Houston and visited seven offices in Washington, DC.  Last year, we took -- Again, that started in Houston.  Last year alone we took 104 travelers, visited 404 offices.  These were actually scheduled sit down meetings.  They're not walk in and hand them a piece of paper.  We schedule these meetings prior to getting there, 404.  We visited 81% of the House, 79% of the Senate to talk about the importance of NASA and innovation technology that the American people get from it.  And we don't talk specifically about JSC.  We talk about NASA and the importance of NASA to America.    Host: It does -- Is human space flight a hard sell on Capitol Hill?    Bob Mitchell: Absolutely not.  I will say 12 years ago it was a bit of a hard sell.  We were able to meet with about 70 or 80 but as we've grown this program, we've met with 404 last year.  It's truly, truly one of the very few issues in Washington that is bipartisan.  We receive support from the Democratic side just as well as we receive it from the Republican side.  There is no division.  They're very supportive.    Cindy DeWease: And welcomed.  The folks come in there and we're from the community.  It's the business community, some industry but mostly it is people that live and work and have jobs, businesses because of community like ours, because NASA is here.  And so it's important for them to go and express to congress my business depends on that facility or I have a business because I'm doing business with NASA.  And so they listen to that message and they see how important it is to the economy but they also see how important it is to human beings, the human race.    Host: Individuals.  William Harris: Well, the complement to that is really the work we do at Space Center Houston because it's the general public.  And your elected officials are going to respond to what their constituents say is important to them and really space is the great frontier and I think it appeals to people of all ages and nations.  And so we are able to inform them around what's going on currently our main charge is interpreting what's happening in space exploration specifically through NASA and Johnson Space Center.  And so I think it's a great complement.  So we often hold briefings.  We allow elected officials to come in to community meetings to hear from their constituents on all topics but it gives them a chance to actually see our exhibits and I have an opportunity too to impart messaging around what's happening in space exploration and why it's a value and important to our community.    Host: It seems pretty clear what Space Center Houston's day-to-day interaction is with JSC, as you said, that's the official visitors center.    William Harris: That is correct.  On the upside for us, because every visitors center has slightly different structure, we're also a 501(c)(3) nonprofit.  So we're independent.  And so we have autonomy.  But to facilitate good communication with JSC, six of our board members are executives from Johnson Space Center.  So they keep us informed around what are the latest programs, initiatives, priorities.  So we're imparting correct information or latest information to the public.  But when situations occur like the recent government shutdown, the furlough, we can still function.  We're not -- Some of our sister visitor centers that were run through the federal agency actually closed or did not have access to facilities as we did.    Host: Right. Cindy commented a moment ago about how when you carrying the message of business people and citizens to Congress saying that this thing that you've got going on in our community in important and that was a major thing at the time that NASA came to this area more than, you know, 55, 57 years ago or now for contrast, any one of you, give me a sense of what this part of the world was like in 1961 when the federal government decided that they were going to establish a NASA center here, where there at the time was nothing.    Bob Mitchell: We'll let Cindy kick that off.  You've been here a little bit longer than me.    Cindy DeWease: A little bit longer.  I know a little bit more about it.  It was mostly a fishing and farming and ranching community.  You know, there was lots of pastureland.  There was of course access to the bay and access to the gulf and so it was great for that.  And so there wasn't a lot of industry here.  There wasn't -- In fact, we were in Austin last week and went into an office and they had a map of Harris County from the late 1800s and it was fascinating to see our area because it had names instead of towns.  This was Sarah Deal's ranch and this was, you know, another ranch.  So it's fascinating to see what it was.  It was a lot of nothing.  So beautiful but there wasn't a Clear Lake City.  There wasn't, you know, League City, which is still growing by leaps and bounds.  And so that's kind of a fun part of our history and folks love to hear that.  They love to hear, well, what was it like, you know, in the '60s here?  And it was all new and everybody was new.  And so you formed a family, a Texas family because people came from all over and you didn't -- There weren't any clicks because nobody came from anywhere.  You know, they did all come together.    Host: They didn’t all go to high school together down the road.    Cindy DeWease: That's right.  That's right.    Bob Mitchell: So let's just go back to that period of time.  At that time, there was about 960 or 70 thousand people in the entire Houston area.  Today, there's 5.5 million.  Now if you just look at our area, the area that we are responsible for, BAHEP is responsible for, it actually goes from the beltway east of Pearland, west to the ship channel, all the way to Galveston Bay.  In that area alone.    Host: That's the bay area.    Bob Mitchell: That's bay area.  In that area alone today, there's 800,000 people.  That's how many we represent at the Bay Area Houston Economic Partnership.    Host: Almost as much as were in the city of Houston proper in 1960.    Bob Mitchell: Absolutely.  So things have changed and I will say that is you get right down to it, as I tell people, JSC is the heart and soul of this region.  JSC is what started this region.  That is where -- That's why we have 800,000 people in this region now.  Of course, other industry has grown.  But without JSC, you would not have had that.    Host: That was going to be my question, whether it was fair to say that putting the Johnson Space Center here was the main driver of this development.    Bob Mitchell: The only driver.    Cindy DeWease: Right.    Host: Okay.    Bob Mitchell: The only driver.    Host: I've always felt that was true and I've lived in the area since the middle '60s.  I always felt that that was true.  But I haven't done the research or to know it for a fact but the thought that well I should, I said, you know, maybe there's something else that was a little responsible and I shouldn't just assume.  But this is what made it what it is.    Bob Mitchell: I would take it a little step further and say that if you look at the number of engineers in the Houston region, no other place in the state of Texas has that many engineers and it all started with the Johnson Space Center.  If you look at every industry that we have, it's high tech.  You look at the oil, energy, healthcare, NASA, specialty chemical, all high tech jobs, all requiring engineers to exceed.  So I can say that would start right here    Host: The oil industry was also centered here and a lot of the development not maybe right here but nearby is connected to that, right?    Bob Mitchell: Sure.  I mean one of the biggest Exxon fields that -- The biggest Exxon field that they had for many, many years was right here in Friendswood.  That's why they call it the Friendswood Development.    Host: I did do a little research.  It said the Friendswood Field is centered roughly at the gulf freeway and Dixie Farm Road, which at the time was not in the city of Houston either because JSC wasn't in the city of Houston but the humble oil company, Exxon Mobile made a large percentage of its money back in those days from right up the road here.    Bob Mitchell: Well, let me tell you a little history.  At the time when they built the Johnson Space Center, the Johnson Space Center was in the City of Pasadena.  So there was negotiations that were held behind the scenes between the major of Pasadena and the major of Houston because NASA when they landed on the moon, they wanted to say \"Houston.\"  And the deal was made -- They made a land swap.  Houston took over the Johnson Space Center and Pasadena took over Armand Bayou.  That was the land swap.    Host: Which is a nature preserve that's just on the other side of the road.    Bob Mitchell: That's how NASA ended up in Houston or JSC.    Cindy DeWease: They didn't want to say \"Pasadena.\"  [Laughter]  Bob Mitchell: Not that's there's anything wrong with Pasadena.    Cindy DeWease: Nothing wrong with Pasadena, right.  It was more identifiable with it being Houston.    Host: I'm sorry, you were going to say?    William Harris: No.    Host: No, you weren't.  [Laughter]  William Harris: That's fascinating.  I didn't know about the land swap.  That's interesting.    Host: You made reference a couple minutes ago to Clear Lake City and Bob to Friendswood Development.  For people who are not in the Houston area, those names may not mean much but those are residential developments here in the region also responsible, a result of NASA coming to the Houston area, right?    Cindy DeWease: Right.  And my family moved here in 1974 and everyone on our street worked for NASA except for my dad who worked for UPS, the man next door that worked for one of the chemical companies and the man across the street who was a preacher.  And so everyone else worked for NASA.  Everyone else worked for NASA.  And they had to have a place to live.  So Nassau Bay was built because the folks were coming here to work and they needed homes, El Lago the same way and then Friendswood Development developed an area called Clear Lake City that was annexed by Houston a few years later and so that area was here because NASA is here and folks needed homes.    Bob Mitchell: If you go back and you talk about the homes and areas that have been built up whenever JSC first established here, Nassau Bay was the first homes that were built there, 95% of the engineers and astronauts that worked at the Johnson Space Center worked or lived in Nassau Bay.    Host: And again for people who are not from the area, Nassau Bay is right out the front gate across the street.    Bob Mitchell: Absolutely.  But if you look at it today, there's about 15 or 16% and then you look over at Friendswood is somewhere in the 27% range and you look at League City is about 31%.  So yes, NASA has created or Johnson Space Center has created all these communities, you know, over the years.    Host: But clearly there needed to be homes for people to live in but there needed to be all the other attendant construction and development to support all those people too.    Cindy DeWease: Right.  Right.  The road, NASA Road 1 which is FM 528 was named from our first chairman of the board.  He named it NASA Road 1 and so he had nothing to do with, he was from Seabrook and was in the fishing community or industry but they were here and we needed to have a roadway there and so he named it NASA Road 1.    William Harris: Good marketing move.    Cindy DeWease: Wasn't that great?  He was a smart fisherman.    William Harris: Yes.  Host:  And in some of the areas, they're trying to change the name of it lately.    Cindy DeWease: Right.    Host: Slightly.    Bob Mitchell: They can call it NASA Parkway all they want but it's really NASA Road 1.    Cindy DeWease: It'll always be NASA Road 1.    Host: I agree, I agree. Has the development of the area and the economic developments that have come from that, has that risen and fallen with the space program over the years?    Bob Mitchell: Yes and no.  Okay, so if you go back to let's just say the Shuttle program.  We had about 18,000 employees here that worked in the space program.  Today we've got rounded off about 13.5, so yeah, it dropped but what was very unique about the NASA when the Shuttle retired and constellation was canceled, there was about 4200 people that got laid off and what we did is we worked very hard with the state of Texas to transition the NASA engineers into other industry clusters.  I went to the state of Texas and said, you know, we need help.  We want to keep these people in Houston.  We don't want to lose this brainpower.  We don't need the brain drain.  We need to keep them.  And what we did -- people said well they're aerospace engineers.  Well, they were electrical engineers.  They were mechanical engineers.    Host: They were software engineers first.   Bob Mitchell: Yes, Software development engineers.  They just loved the space program and went into the space program.  So their skills are marketable.  And what we were able to do, there was no downturn in the real estate market; 88% of the people that got laid off got jobs in the Houston area, specialty chemical, healthcare.  It was like 900 that went to the medical center.  There was a number of them that went to energy.  So the idea for people to think that we went way down after that, the housing market did not go down in this region at all.    Host: Does Space Center Houston see a rise and fall of visitors related to what happens at the Johnson Space Center?    William Harris: Well, I think it's more NASA overall.  So it's the public interest in space and what's transpiring and when the Shuttle program retired, that had an impact on the organization because there was a view that is NASA shutting down, is it no longer functioning and so all the visitor centers experienced a downturn in attendance and probably the most dramatic one was Kennedy because their hallmark is going for launches and there weren't launches taking place any longer.  And they actually had a nearly 50% drop in attendance.  In our case, we needed to refresh our exhibits and really pivot back to being a dynamic learning destination.  The organization had drifted more toward an attraction and having more kind of entertainment type content.  And so with the change, we've actually seen a huge up spike in attendance and really the turning point for us was acquiring Independence Plaza, the 747, the Shuttle Carrier Aircraft 905 and the high-fidelity replica of the Shuttle.  And we experienced an increase of attendance by nearly 200,000 people in one year and we've been able to sustain that and grow it beyond that point.    Host: And you've been able to be pretty confident that that's why, that's the relationship?    William Harris: Absolutely.  I think -- Well, the other thing and this is something we're really emphasizing is honestly, people have enough stuff or things and what the priority in life now are experiences and so the priority for visitors is experiences they want to have a vicarious experience.  They want to get behind the scenes.  They want to understand how things function.  And one of the unique experiences here, you really get behind the scenes at Johnson Space Center.  We have the ability to take you into the working facilities and labs more so than any other NASA center or visitor center.  And I think that's why we've experienced such a surge.  People want to understand how do you train astronauts and what are the challenges of living in space and how are we going to send humans to other celestial bodies like Mars.  So those are the kind of questions we receive from our visitors.    Host: Earlier, you referred to how before Space Center Houston, visitors could just, you know, come up here and park on the curb and walk around that they can't do anymore but, as you mention, your facility is bringing people on site.  Talk about where they can go on site, what can they see.    William Harris: Absolutely.  So now it's managed of course and because of security and access and also volume of visitors because we are at 1.1 million visitors a year.  You could not have that volume of people just walking around the campus at Johnson Space Center.  It would be really disruptive.    Host: I wouldn't have a place to park.    William Harris: That's true, exactly.  And so we offer kind of levels of experiences for someone who comes as a general guest to Space Center Houston, you can take a tram to see the mockup facility where there is a high-fidelity replica of the International Space Station that's used for training and developing solutions when there's challenges on station.  There's a whole area that used to have Shuttle and that's now the robotics lab where they're developing Robonaut 5 or Valkyrie, you know the most advanced independent humanoid robot in the world who's going to support missions with astronauts in the future and we also mentor high school robotics programs.  So there's a lot of community outreach that happens through Johnson.  We also will take you to see the Saturn Five building and the Saturn Five currently is the most powerful rocket, this probably will be, the next most powerful rocket that's coming along was space launch system SLS but currently it's the Saturn Five which took astronauts to the moon and we have one that's made from real components, unlike the other two that are on display.  So you get up and close and understand what it took to get away from Earth's gravitational pull and go all the way to the moon.    Bob Mitchell: And just how big it is.    William Harris: Yes, exactly.  It's absolutely massive.    Host: Yeah, that's a shock or me the first time I went and stood next to it to see just how big it is.    William Harris: And then a really busy period is we arrange special tours of the Neutral Buoyancy Lab over at Ellington Airport.  So we'll take guests over to see again how astronauts train in water, you know, to prepare for extravehicular activities or spacewalks.  And that's very exciting because it's one of the largest indoor pools in the world and you actually see again full-scale replica of station and see astronauts often training from the viewing area.  And so there are a couple of facilities we'll take you to as well depending on accessibility.  One challenge we face is this is a working laboratory.  It's a working facility and sometimes we can't get access to things.  So there is an International Space Station control room and we can take guests into viewing area most times unless there's something going on that they don't want any kind of disruption or distraction.  We also have the Orion training room because that is one of NASA's top priorities now is the Gateway project and returning humans to orbit the moon and using that as a base to travel deeper into space.  So we're beginning to interpret that as well.    Host: The presence of the Johnson Space Center here clearly brings in federal budget dollars that fund what's going on.  But JSC also generates a lot of partnerships with other kinds of businesses.  It's not just civil servants.  It's other people that are working here.  Cindy, Bob, William, give me a sense of what other kind of partnerships have grown up in this area.  What other kind of businesses have thrived in this area because NASA was here?    Cindy DeWease: Well, our chamber is made up of a lot of small businesses and mostly small business.  We have Fortune 500 companies but we have flooring companies, printing companies.  Bob mentioned My Flooring America as a member of BAHEP.  They're also a member of our chamber and they're one of the flooring contractors for NASA.  And they are, you know, a small business doing business in commercial but also residential and have a great contract with the Johnson Space Center.  So I think Minuteman Press has a great contract with Space Center Houston.  So even the small businesses and in fact next week we're doing a workshop on how to do business with the federal government.  And so it's very important to our members on how do I get, you know, how do I have that kind of access and so our small business development center is putting that on.    Host: By the way, I heard it's really easy to do business with the federal government.    Cindy DeWease: I'm sure it is and we're going to find that out next week.  That's why you have to do workshops on it.  Right?    Host: I guess, yeah.    Bob Mitchell: I'll give you a couple examples as well.  The Johnson Space Center partners with UTMB down in Galveston for some human factors and studies.    Host: That's the University of Texas Medical Branch, Medical School and Hospital in Galveston.    Bob Mitchell: Correct. They have a long-term relationship with them and have a very long-term relationship with the Baylor College of Medicine and the Texas Medical Center where they're doing -- In fact, they're doing studies on the Kelly brothers, some genetic studies with them, and then you look at the pumps and pipes where they partnered with the oil industry and the healthcare industry to do crossover within each industry cluster because if you for example if you look at the oil industry, they have pumps, they have pipes.  You look at the heart business, the cardiac business, they have pumps in your heart and they have pipes.  And believe it or not, some of the same calculations that they use in the oil field they use in the healthcare industry.  They discovered that about eight or nine years ago.  So we were able to get the aerospace community now involved in that as well.  So you have the pumps and pipes.  So there's a lot of partnerships.  Most recently in the last five years we created an organization called BayTech and what we do is we find companies outside of the gates that could use facilities inside the gates because they offer things here that you don't offer anywhere else in the world.    Host: Use facilities, NASA facilities on site like?    Bob Mitchell: Like the test labs, a number of the test labs.  You have companies that need that service.  They can't get it anywhere else.  So what they do instead of coming here and having to negotiate with JSC, the bureaucracy, which would normally take seriously if you're a small business owner, it would take you six months to get in here.    Host: It's really easy.    Bob Mitchell: Well, it is now.  It is now because once we created BayTech, BayTech has a Space Act Agreement with the Johnson Space Center and all of our contractors so the companies go to BayTech and within three days, you could be doing work in the Johnson Space Center.  So we took it from seriously a six to nine month process down to three days.  And we have a number of companies every year that come in and utilize these facilities.    William Harris: Well something I'd like to add on to that which I think is really important is increasingly NASA is open to the public helping to come up with solutions to challenges and there is a tremendous amount of tech transfer or knowledge transfer from innovation to space exploration that benefits society every day.  We have a major gallery at Space Center Houston on the International Space Station and where we interpret and convey insights investigations that are taking place that have applications that benefit life on Earth.  In fact, there's a great publication called Benefits to Humanity that's available through NASA.gov online and there're literally thousands of examples of scientific insights that are creating products and benefits.  I think, you know, you talk about the oil industry healthcare, there're all kind of transfer of knowledge that's taking place from research on International Space Station to life on Earth.  So for example, we now have on our website something called the Innovation Challenge Gateway where we're doing community science projects.   So we're actually the allied partner with the next space robotics challenge and this is a really fun story.  So we partnered with NASA on the last space robotics challenge that actually had cash prizes associated with it and it was to come up with five programming solutions for Robonaut 5 or Valkyrie.  And so it was a worldwide challenge.  If you were a US citizen or resident, you qualified for a cash prize.  There were teams from all over the world that submitted applications.  We narrowed it down in partnership with NASA to ten semifinalists.  We brought them to Houston to Space Center Houston and then we took it another step where we had those teams mentor high school robotics teams and held the competition on the floor so the general public could experience it.  And the person who won three -- We had a team from a premier technological university at MIT and a couple of others, so incredibly qualified people who are working on this virtual challenge.  The person who won three of the five challenges was a stay-at-home dad from Southern California who brought his six-year-old son who worked as an independent coder as a consultant.  And so his insights have now been used to develop these protocols for Valkyrie.   So we're now doing the next space robotics challenge and again, it's going to be open to the general public and we're doing a number of other community challenges and the public has been so interested in this and so engaged in it.  And it's just -- It's not exclusive to the Houston region.  It's people from across the nation and around the world that actually have somebody full time who's dedicated to these community challenges.  But again, it's a way that anyone can participate in coming up with solutions that are going to benefit society ultimately in some way.    Host: That's nice.  Yeah, I remember and it's been three, four years ago now, I remember that the Neutral Buoyancy Laboratory that you referred to before was making an effort to let it be known outside the gates that the NBL was available for companies that needed to do big testing of things.  You could bring a mock-up and drop it in the pool and do testing.    Bob Mitchell: Very actively involved.  There was a number of companies but probably the one I want to talk about most is the oil field industry.  They need to train their workers if there's a helicopter crash how to get out of the helicopter.  Okay?  And so they started that process at the NBL.  They had this mock helicopter and every day they would train, you know, 15 or 20 or 30 workers in this helicopter to learn if the helicopter crashed into the water, how to get out of, and how to get out, if it flipped to the left, how to get out, if it flipped to the right, how to get out, if it nosedived, how to get out.  And it was an incredible project that they operate for quite some time.    Host: Yeah and they can do that a lot more efficiently than they could if they took a helicopter out here to the lake and --    Bob Mitchell: Which is basically what they were doing.    Host: They had -- What those companies had been doing.  Yeah.  Do you see a big growth or a big change in things when NASA and Johnson Space Center start new programs?  The commercial crew program is getting off, has just gotten off the ground.  The first test flight was here just a couple of weeks ago.  Orion is in development.  Do you see any effect of how those new programs turn into more business in the area?    William Harris: Well, I think absolutely depending on what it is.  So for example, with Gateway, Johnson has been identified as the site for integration, for that future space lab.    Host: You're referring to the plan to build this lab near the moon?    William Harris: Correct.  That's right.  I know one company that's immediately hiring 400 staff.  I mean, they're trying to fill—  Host: Now?  William Harris: Right now.  That's like immediate just as a first step and so that is like, if you will, a pebble in a pond, the effect in this area because when you are awarded a big project through NASA, it has great ramifications across industry.  So of course more scientists and engineers but it means more housing, it means more retail in the area, it means families are going to be relocating here potentially and enrolling in the school system.  So it really has an effect across the entire community.  So absolutely there is a great impact.    Bob Mitchell: I’ll just add to that I believe we've turned a corner on that.  It has been a very challenging in the recent past on getting new programs here at the Johnson Space Center.  But I really believe starting with the Gateway, we've turned the corner on that.  So I'm excited about the opportunity that we are going to be the home of integration for that.    Host: In a sense having long-term successful programs that were centered here prohibited new programs from coming.  We were still flying shuttles for as long as we were.  We are still flying the International Space Station.  And it doesn't leave as much room for new stuff and new people without a whole bunch of new government funding.    Bob Mitchell: True.  You look back at the budget, you know, and you go back six years ago, our budget was about 16.5 billion, the entire federal budget for NASA.  Today, it's 21.5.  The Johnson Space Center when flying the Shuttle, our budget was about $7.2 billion a year went through the Johnson Space Center.  Today, it's about 4.6 billion that goes through the Johnson Space Center.  Of that 4.6 billion, about 1.2 billion is in salaries alone.  It's pretty solid.    Host: Yeah.  When NASA has big events, you know, shorter term impact but when there are big events here like announcing commercial crew assignments or something like that, does that show up, does that show up for businesses in the area?    Cindy DeWease: I would say probably it does.  I mean, I don't know that I've ever thought about it in that way but of course, I mean we have an expanding economy and businesses are still moving here that have nothing to do with being a technology company, I mean look at the growth at Baybrook Mall and real estate and you're constantly seeing some of the older facilities being torn down with brand-new, you know, strip centers or whatever going up.  And so obviously there's a strong, there's still a strong economy here and part of it is the diversity of the area but it's still, we're very proud to say we're the home of the Johnson Space Center, our country's astronauts.  And I travel for the chamber of commerce nationwide or statewide and whenever where is Clear Lake, well that is the home of the Johnson Space Center.  Oh really, you know.  So it does -- There's a sense of pride for that identification.    Bob Mitchell: You know, the commercial crew announcement I think affects our economy a little bit differently.  That process has been going on for a couple of years before they make that official announcement.  When they make that official announcement and they hold it here and the media shows up, that benefits the entire Houston area.  That's when people say, oh my gosh, NASA is open.  They are doing business.  They are working.  It helps -- It's got to help William over at the Space Center Houston because it gets people excited about the space program.  So I think that's where we benefit the most is when they make those announcements.  The media comes out.  They talk about it.  People get excited.  And that to me is the biggest benefit.    William Harris: I think that's a really good point because we work very closely with Visit Houston and the Greater Convention and Visitors Bureau and we and that's helping Houston attract more big conventions and professional meetings and things of that nature and then we become a top destination for an event or other tours or some other experience associated with that convention or that business meeting that might be taking place here.  We're all very focused right now on, you know, we have the big convention of oil producer, the world summit on oil is coming up really soon.  You know, we're bidding for other kind of major events.  It helped us secure Super Bowl, you know, a couple years ago.  These are all factors and so the fact that we have a NASA center here and a major visitor’s center where you can come and experience the space program is a big plus.  I mean, the whole Super Bowl 51 was themed around space exploration.    Host: Yeah.  Well I was going to ask you about that.  NASA's here, so the giant visitor's center is here and it's now the number one visitors' attraction in this region.  Does your presence there help other visitors' attractions in the area and contribute to other things coming in just because Space Center Houston is there?    William Harris: I think absolutely yes and I see us as part of the larger community and we really are more so than ever trying to collaborate with other organizations in town.  You know, one of our top priorities at Space Center Houston is diversity, equity, inclusion, accessibility and so we're really striving to be as accessible to everyone in the region.  We're actually the first science center in the world that's been certified as an autism service center and that meant that our facility went through a complete review that we, all our staff went through training and testing and we have special support features like quiet rooms and kits that families can check out who have someone on the autism spectrum.  But that's just one example of many that we're --    Host: I admit, that's a thing I didn't even know was a thing.    William Harris: Yeah, well, sadly, autism is very prevalent and even more so in our society.  So how do we be accessible to everyone and a welcoming organization for everyone.  So we've been partnering as well with dogs for the blind where they actually train seeing eye dogs in our facility during peak days so the dogs are accustomed to large numbers of people coming through.  We work -- We offer special camping and overnights for all kinds of groups including blue star family and gold star families and working with all types of associations and clubs as well just to give everyone an opportunity to come together in community because space is just a great platform to learn about all aspects of society and all academic areas.    Host: I had nephews in Boy Scouts who used to go overnight campout at Space Center Houston.    William Harris: Yeah.  We do badges for Girl Scouts and Boy Scouts.    Host: And you mentioned the Super Bowl.  And I think maybe a lot of people wouldn't connect the Super Bowl in Houston having anything to do with NASA but it did.    Bob Mitchell: It was a plan.  There was definitely a plan.  And I will tell you -- I'll talk to a lot of people in different cities and I think the NFL will tell you that Houston was probably the best one, best location they've had in ten or 15 years simply because of what NASA did with their exhibits.  It was a huge draw, huge draw.  I mean, I can't explain it.  William, you might be able to --    William Harris: Well, I think it's important to have a sense of place wherever you go especially for big sporting events or any kind of convention.  So we have World Petroleum Congress coming which I alluded to a little bit earlier.  That'll probably be themed very much around the NASA and the space program.  That was the case for Super Bowl but you want people to have the sense of place where you're going that's a major part of our identity here in Houston.  It is Space City.    Host: And Space City is already, you can see it everywhere.  It's gearing up for the 50th anniversary of the moon landing.  How do you imagine that is or is it already having an impact right here in this community?    Cindy DeWease: Oh yeah.  It's very nostalgic and so they like that history and that memory of that and we've gone through old pictures and looked at stuff.  And so we've themed some of our events at Epicurean Evening that we have in January at Space Center Houston.  That was themed after Apollo's 50th anniversary.  We did our boat parade with a moon and included the logo for that.  And so it's an exciting time and makes people remember and appreciate what they did.  I mean what those folks did that had never been done before and so I think it has a great impact and especially in this area when people feel so close to it, whether they lived here or were a part of it at all, they still feel close to that.    William Harris: I think absolutely.  As you can imagine, we are doing major activity and we're collaborating with headquarters and the other visitors' centers.  My belief is that Houston will be like New Years Eve in New York.  On July 20th, this is where everyone's going to be focused and we have put together a major calendar of programming and activity.  We're working actually very closely with organizations across the city with Houston First and Visit Houston, our promotional agencies of the City of Houston and linking to a national calendar that NASA has posted as well but we're really in Houston focusing on the whole summer.  We're calling it Space City Summer and have programming happening and you can go to our website to learn more.  We have a calendar with those things posted.  So we have everything from our thought leader series where we're bringing in luminaries from the Apollo program.  Too, we're doing a space on screen series, so every month we're showing a feature film.  So we showed in January \"Last Man on the Moon\" and did a panel with Gene's daughter and his first wife that gave an insider perspective on what transpired.   We showed \"The Right Stuff\" last month.  We're showing \"Hidden Figures\" next Friday at Space Center Houston.  But I do want to focus on that period in July which I think is going to be so exciting here where beginning on launch day, the 16th of July, we have a panel or sorry a roundtable with 14 of the flight controllers from the Apollo era who are all going to talk about aspects of their experiences.  We're going to have all kinds of events and programs.  Really the huge day of course is going to be the 20th which was the day we landed on the moon and took the first steps and the great thing is the first steps were mid afternoon on a Saturday Central time.  So we're going to have a countdown experience and then in the evening about 9:58 PM is when Neil Armstrong, you know, had the first boot on the surface of the moon and we're actually planning a huge concert and festival that day.  And then we're also at the close and splashdown which is really important at Johnson because we, the people here did not relax until the astronauts were safely back on Earth, out of the capsule and on the deck of the carrier and so we're going to be a big '60s themed party on the 24th on splashdown day.  So those are just a highlight of the few things we're doing.  We're also, as I mentioned, --    Host: Before I forget to ask you again, what's the website?    William Harris: Oh, spacecenter.org.  So if you Google or put in your browser space center Houston, we'll come up and you can go to our calendar section and learn more.  But there are going to be things happening all over the city.  On the 20th, discovery green is going to be showing the new documentary \"Apollo 11.\"  The Museum of Natural Sciences has interpretive domes that they're going to have all over the city.  We're actually reaching out to surrounding communities that have agreed to be part of the celebration that day.  So we'll have a lot happening here.  There are going to be celebrations happening throughout the Houston region.    Host: Nice.  Are there bad aspects of the area being so reliant and having prospered so much from the government being here?    Bob Mitchell: Oh, I'd say no.  I don't think -- We have such a diversified economy here now.  We really do and it all started with the Johnson Space Center.    Host: But it's not 100% reliant on the Johnson Space Center.    Bob Mitchell: Absolutely not.  I would say our economy here now today, believe it or not, is somewhere around 22 or 23% reliant on the Johnson Space Center.  Absolutely.    Host: That seems like a small number.    Bob Mitchell: It is but it's the heart and soul.  It's what drives it.    William Harris: Something I'd like to add and I totally agree with that that it's become much more diversified which is a good thing but the space program now works in partnership with so many entities and I think the genesis of the commercial sector was a natural thing.  You know, Houston now has the innovation quarter, the technological quarter along the spine of the city, along the tramline and Johnson Space Center is working very closely with that initiative.  And so because there's so much innovation that happens here and so much knowledge transfer that can stimulate new businesses.  So we're really a key part of that.  I mean, Space Center Houston has just established a partnership with the University of Houston and San Jacinto College and workforce development because we don't have enough people here in science and engineering and we're constantly having to recruit people from other areas but we could home grow more of those qualified individuals and so we're really looking at how can we improve the pool, and increase the pool of local talent.    Host: What aspects of the relationship am I not seeing, have we not talked about?  What other important things are going on here because NASA is here?    Bob Mitchell: Well, go back and talk about the spaceport.  We created the spaceport about five years ago.  I went to Mayor Annise Parker and suggested to her that she go through the process of creating a spaceport and she looked at me like I was crazy and I said, Annise, I'm not talking about launching rockets.  I'm talking about supersonic travel, air travel.  I'm talking about going from Houston to New York in 40 minutes and going to Houston to England in two and a half hours.  Those planes are being designed and developed today.  Where better to do it than in Houston?  We're an international city.  There's only one city in the United States of America that has been embassies than we do and that's New York and they beat us by five.  We are an international city.  And we are, we would be -- When I told her, I said we would be the only spaceport in an MSA.  The other spaceports, there's ten of them located all around the US but all of them are not in an MSA.  They're right on the coast.  They're in the dessert.  They're in West Texas.  They're in South Texas.  Where better than right here?  So she went through the process.  We got with Mario Diaz at Houston Airport System.  He is a bulldog.  He got it done in about two and a half years.  We spent a lot of money to get it done.  But we are growing the spaceport.    Host: And how does that designation and it's at Ellington Airport which is a few miles up the road from JSC, what does that designation mean is going to happen there?    Bob Mitchell: That means that planes can take off and land and travel at supersonic travel over the gulf.  Right now you can't fly over the US but that's quickly changing.  NASA has created a new plane that has a low boom effect that we had tested at Galveston this past year.  It passed in flying colors.  And that's the next step to completing those type of aircraft and being able to fly over the continental United States at supersonic travel.  You have to be a spaceport in order to launch and land supersonic travel aircraft.    Host: Nice.  What about pride?  People around here care about the fact that NASA's here?    Bob Mitchell: Absolutely.  I mean, we're Texans.    Cindy DeWease: Right.    Bob Mitchell: We're very proud of this region and NASA and what it's done for the community.  Again, it goes back to the heart and soul and it's really grown the city of Houston into what it is.  It really has.    Cindy DeWease: And so many folks came here, they weren't from here, they came here and they're still here.  They retired here.  They stayed in this community because it's a great community and it honors the NASA tradition and the JSC tradition and I think why would they stay here if they're family is not here and so --    William Harris: I think the other measure of that is you look at the recognition.  So if you go to any of the big sporting events, there's always a NASA night with the Astros or the Rockets or the Texas or the Dynamos—  Bob Mitchell: Or the rodeo.  Cindy DeWease: Or the rodeo. Yeah.  William Harris: The rodeo.  Yeah, you can go on and on with the examples.    Host: Yes, there's a rodeo.    Cindy DeWease: And there's a NASA night there.    Host: Yes there is.  William Harris: Yes, so there's is recognition and those organizations would not hold those nights if they didn't know the public would embrace it.  The public care and are passionate about it and they're really proud that this is the home of NASA center.    Host: William, Cindy, Bob, thank you for sharing your expertise on this.  Very interesting conversation.    William Harris: Thank you.  Cindy DeWease: Thank you for inviting us.    Bob Mitchell: Thanks for the opportunity.    Host: Thanks.

                        "description": "Pat Ryan: Houston, we have a podcast. Welcome to the official podcast of the NASA Johnson Space Center. Episode 89, \"The Heroes Behind the Heroes,\" Part 2. I'm Pat Ryan, and I'm pleased you've joined us to pick up on the story of the rescue of an artifact of American history. The audio recordings of NASA's mission control center during Apollo 11, the first landing of men on the moon. In part one we introduced the story of a professor from the University of Texas at Dallas who studies speech processing and language technology. And wants to move the field beyond a smartphone being able to understand simple questions. In 2012, he wanted to study language as used by a large group of people interacting with one another on a common project or during an emergency. And he found out that NASA's Johnson Space Center in Houston had recordings of the conversations of the mission control team during the Apollo missions. That would be perfect for his research. And he got a grant from the National Science Foundation to fund the work. But when he got to Houston, he discovered some seemingly impenetrable obstacles to his plan. And that's where we start part 2 of \"The Heroes Behind the Heroes.\" Here we go.  [ Music ]  NASA's Apollo program was created to achieve an outrageous goal. The one set by President John Kennedy in 1961, to land men on the moon by the end of that decade. And return them safely to the Earth. The agency's scientists and engineers not only had to develop the rockets and the spaceships that would execute the missions, but the systems on the ground that would support those flights. And that included the development of a mission control center where experts could monitor the systems on a spacecraft. And collaborate to resolve any issues that arose. The conversations among the mission control team members during Apollo 11 and the other missions were recorded. Thirty separate channels of them, simultaneously on big reels of one-inch wide audio tape. And then the tapes were pretty much forgotten about for more than 40 years. Until John Hansen asked if he could borrow them. John Hansen is a professor at the University of Texas at Dallas who studies speech processing and communications and biomedical engineering. And he's a leader in the field of speech recognition technology. He wanted to use those tapes for his study of the speech of groups of people working collaboratively. And he won a federal grant to fund the work. When he approached NASA with this proposal, he got a big surprise.  [ Music ]  John Hansen: Right after we got the grant, we came down to NASA. And I naively said, well, can you show us where you have the audio. And Greg Wiseman pointed us to some boxes of tapes. And I said, we're in trouble here. Because we thought this was all digitized. And so that was 2013 or so. And at that point we started the process of figuring out how do we actually go about digitizing these things? So that was an engineering problem by itself.  Pat Ryan: Well, but even before that I guess at some point you've got NASA who, somebody high up the food chain who says, yes, we'll be happy to share this with you.  John Hansen: Well, so we talked actually with several folks. There's one colleague of mine at the University of Maryland who was also involved on this project. And he's kind of a NASA, or at least Apollo, I don't know, maybe a closet trivia expert on this. And he kept telling me, John, it's probably going to take you a year to two years to get permission from NASA to actually go in and digitize this stuff. And so we were, actually I was really nervous. Because we got the proposal, and I thought, well, if we're going to have to go through a lot of bureaucratic processes here, we weren't going to be able to actually advance the engineering algorithms and so forth. But I will say we had the best support that we could ever have possibly hoped to imagine here with NASA. Greg Wiseman just opened the door and really gave us support that we could never imagine would have been so helpful in developing this process. Because it wouldn't have happened without that infrastructure here at NASA.  [ Music ]  Greg Wiseman: My name is Greg Wiseman. I'm an audio engineer here at the Johnson Space Center, supporting the Public Affairs Office. I work in multimedia production and live television for dynamic broadcast coverage.  Pat Ryan: You've worked here for 15 years, 20 years?  Greg Wiseman: I worked here since February of 1999.   Pat Ryan: Seen a lot of weird stuff come through here in that time.   Greg Wiseman: I have, I started working around the beginning of the International Space Station. I worked through a big part of the shuttle program. I was here during the Columbia accident. And then worked through return to flight. And now building towards Orion and commercial crew.  Pat Ryan: How did you first become aware of John Hansen and his project dealing with the Apollo 11 mission control tape recordings?  Greg Wiseman: Hansen had the project with the National Science Foundation. And he had reached out to the JSC history program who eventually directed him to our department. And I think, if I remember right, Hansen had seen an article about our department in \"Mix Magazine.\" They had done a short story about some of the things that we do here in the audio control room. And they had included a picture of some of my colleagues standing in front of the SoundScriber. So he became aware of who we were, and he reached out. Made contact with my supervisor John Stoll, who then handed the project over to me.  Pat Ryan: When you met with Hansen then, what was your sense of what he was after?  Greg Wiseman: So he shared with me his proposal he had submitted to the NSF. And so I had a basic understanding of the academic research that he was pursuing with the project. Which was interesting. But what really interested me was to, was that he had funding that he was willing to apply towards solving some of the problems we had in being able to do this. Part of that was getting the SoundScriber back in working order.  Pat Ryan: Now, let me stop you there. And let's do a little clarification. You've mentioned SoundScriber. And we hear the word \"SoundScriber\" in this story before. Can you describe, characterize, explain that machine. What is the SoundScriber?  Greg Wiseman: The SoundScriber is an analog audio tape machine. It plays back one-inch 30 track tape. It has two heads for playback. One channel each head. Originally they did have a dedicated head for just reading IRIG time codes so that you could queue up a particular section of tape that you needed based on a timeframe. But the other two playback heads were, they sat on a little moveable block. And the way that you would select which track that you wanted to listen to is you would turn this little crank. And it would physically move the head up or down the width of the tape to line the head up over the track. And it had a little number counter that would tell you which track you were on, approximately. I mean, it wasn't always super precise. So you dial up which track you wanted. You'd hit play. You'd wait to hear some audio. And then you might need to tweak the crank a little to better position the head over the tape track.  Pat Ryan: So the SoundScriber machine was a playback unit, not the, didn't record these tapes?  Greg Wiseman: Right. So the way that these were used back in the 60s and the early 70s, it was part of a larger system. They had two 30 track recorders that were recording 24/7, at least during a mission. Recording 60 discrete channels of audio. And they had a couple units right underneath them that, they would kick in once the top one was near the end of its tape. So it would get near the end of the tape, the bottom one would kick in. And this allowed for uninterrupted recordings. So they would roll off that tape. Then they would put it on a shelf. And then later on, if somebody wanted to request a copy of a particular channel of audio in a particular timeframe, then they would, the operator would take that tape over to the SoundScriber that would load it up. They could queue it up to whatever time that they were looking for. And then they could make a copy. They could roll that off probably onto 1/4-inch tape.  Pat Ryan: This is, to call it a playback, call it a tape recorder that plays back audio is, doesn't really give you the sense of what this enormous machine is.  Greg Wiseman: The SoundScriber is huge. It's this pale green, painted monster. I mean, it would be tricky to fit this thing in the back of a pickup truck. It's about 4.5 feet tall. Another four-feet wide. And maybe 2.5-feet deep. Very heavy. It's certainly not a compact piece of equipment.  Pat Ryan: That's the machine. You also had earlier made reference to the tapes, as if you're really aware that these old recordings exist and have worked with them before.  Greg Wiseman: We have a half dozen of these 30 track tapes in our collection from other missions. Such as Gemini. And we have a few from Apollo-Soyuz as well. Back when I started in 1999, that was one of my first projects was to try and digitize these tapes. Back in '99 super cheap hard drive space wasn't a thing yet. So we were going to archive these onto digital data tapes. Which was our common archive format back then. But I really didn't have a lot of success because the SoundScriber just wasn't fully functional at that point. I would load up a 15-hour tape when I left at the end of the day, intending for it to roll all night into our digital archive system. But when I would come in in the morning, the tape would be stuck about halfway through. There just wasn't enough friction left on the pinch roller to pull the tape across the head. So that was a problem.  Pat Ryan: Wiseman's problems with the SoundScriber ended up being mentioned in an engineering periodical. And that's where it caught the eye of Larry Vrooman, who had worked on these very machines at the Johnson Space Center in the late 1970s and early 80s.  Larry Vrooman: I tripped over an article in \"Mix Magazine.\" It's a professional audio magazine, professional musician audio magazine. Really more about studio support personnel. And I tripped over an article in there about Greg. They had interviewed Greg about his project. And back at that time, he was struggling with, for example, the pinch roller.  Pat Ryan: Wait a minute, there's that phrase again. He was struggling with the what?  Larry Vrooman: Pinch roller.  Pat Ryan: I feel compelled to pause here. What is a pinch roller? And why does it matter?  Larry Vrooman: Well, the rubber is a compliant tacky surface. And the capstan, the metal machine, the capstan is not. So the capstan is rotated at a speed that the surface contact with the tape achieves the desired tape speed. And then the pinch roller simply ensures intimate contact. And the pinch roller actually does the pulling of the tape.  Pat Ryan: And so, if anybody has got or remembers a tape recorder, there's a black rubber roller that comes down against that slender metal, silver metal thing. The capstan that comes out. And when the two come together, that's the actual force that pulls the tape through.  Larry Vrooman: Yes. Yes, that pulls the tape through. And then both reels, which have motors behind them, apply back tension so that the tape is pulled across the heads with relatively even tension.  Pat Ryan: And that's in both the case of when a recording is made and when it's played back.  Larry Vrooman: Yes. The actual tape movement in those two instances should be identical.  Pat Ryan: And you want that so that it sounds like, in the playback, it sounds like what it did when it happened.  Larry Vrooman: Yeah, you want an accurate reproduction of what was recorded.  Pat Ryan: And, hence, why having a pinch roller and the machines, the motors that turn those things that were in good shaped and worked as they were supposed to, was critical in order to get the playback.  Larry Vrooman: Absolutely.  Pat Ryan: Okay, that's what a pinch roller is. And now, on with the countdown.  Larry Vrooman: I e-mailed him. I just did some research and e-mailed him. And I, it occurred to me that I needed to e-mail him in such a way that I would get his attention. So he wouldn't think I was just anybody. And basically I said that, you know, if that thing hasn't been thoroughly cleaned, it's still got my fingerprints on it.  Pat Ryan: Wow.  Larry Vrooman: And I also offered my services to help work on the machine. Because, in fact, I was, in fact, at one time responsible for that particular machine.  Pat Ryan: So—  Larry Vrooman: That's how I got started. I found an article in \"Mix Magazine\" about his project.  Pat Ryan: Tell me how, about your involvement then. Tell me from that point, what were you doing?  Larry Vrooman: Well, I contacted Greg about what he needed to, if he needed help. And he said he did. Because he didn't have the training and the experience to do that, and I do. So we arranged a trip for me to come to Houston to take a look and analyze and evaluate the machine. And it was pretty much the way I envisioned. That it needed a remanufactured pinch roller. And it had a couple other minor issues that we worked through. And we swapped some parts from the old, the two, he had two machines.  Pat Ryan: Two of these SoundScriber playback machines.  Larry Vrooman: Two of the decks.  Pat Ryan: Right.  Larry Vrooman: I had never seen the second one. Because in operation, when it was mounted on a second floor of mission control center, it was in its own cabinet. And I had, and it always worked. And I don't recall ever fixing anything on it. And it never needed any service. So I've never seen the second machine. Turns out it's not fully complete. I don't know if they, if it had ever been in service. Maybe in the early days maybe it was. But we, in fact, swapped a few parts back and forth between the two machines. And got the one we want to work actually working once we replaced the pinch roller.  Greg Wiseman: The pinch roller is essentially just a little rubber wheel. And this one, the rubber over years had broken down. It had become slick. And it couldn't, you kind of depend on that tackiness of the rubber to get the right grip on the tape so that it can pull it across the heads. And this one couldn't do it anymore. So Larry is an analog tape enthusiast. He has a lot of experience and contacts who have expertise. And he couldn't replace the rubber, but he had a friend that could. So we disassembled the pinch roller from the SoundScriber. And sent it off to his friend in Michigan. A guy named Terry Whitt. And it was Terry who replaced the old rubber with newly vulcanized rubber. And then he had it machined down to just the right size for the SoundScriber. And once we got it back, we could tell there was a big difference. It was tacky. And once we got it back installed, it could easily maintain the proper friction to pull the tape across the head. Then we sort of tore down some of the machine. Lubricated any kind of moving parts. I think we replaced a belt. Which we were able to do that by cannibalizing from another broke down machine that we had. I think we also swapped out one of the supply reel motors. And then Larry just kind of went over the machine, making little adjustments. Tightening screws. And just getting it back into full working order.  Pat Ryan: How long did it take to get it back into operating condition?  Greg Wiseman: I think it took about three days. I think Larry visited three times. He made pretty short work of it because he knew what he was doing. He worked on these machines for years. So he was able to quickly diagnosis problems and knew what to do to get it functioning again. And luckily we didn't have any major part breakdowns. If we had, getting replacement parts would have been really difficult or next to impossible. The few things that we did need, we were able to scavenge off the other SoundScriber that we had that was basically just pieces in a box.  Pat Ryan: Did you ever think of contacting the manufacturer and say, hey, help us out?  Greg Wiseman: Based on some Internet research, it looked like to me that the SoundScriber was discontinued in the late 70s. So parts would have been hard to come by. And Dr. Hansen had done some research on his end. And from what he could tell, we may have one of the only machines left in existence. So we figured we were going to be on our own.  Pat Ryan: So the SoundScriber is now operating. It's playing back tapes. Although it is doing that one channel of audio at a time. And there are still some hurdles up ahead. But Wiseman was jazzed about the situation which he found himself.  Greg Wiseman: This was something that I had wanted to do back in 1999. This was one of my early projects. So finding someone who had some funding and could help solve some of these problems, yeah. I mean, it got me really excited because I'd been sitting on this project for a while.  Pat Ryan: So what was your first step? How did you go about figuring out how to refurbish the machine?  Greg Wiseman: So once we knew that this was something that we were going to take on, after some initial meetings with Dr. Hansen, we discussed some of the challenges that we were facing. And one of which was the playback head. As it was, the SoundScriber could only play back two channels at a time. The other problem was getting the actual Apollo tapes on hand. Because that mission was specifically identified in his NSF grant. We didn't have those tapes NARA did. And the process for requesting those tapes involves pouring through handwritten transfer documents from the late 70s that have been scanned and stored electronically. And even if you're able to narrow it down and find a document that might describe the correct box that these tapes would have been stored in. It was a little cryptic because the transfer document will just say something like \"historical audio tapes.\" But nothing as to what's on the tapes or even what format of tape. I mean, I was looking for one-inch 30 track specifically. I didn't want 1/4-inch. I mean, that's, that wouldn't have helped me. So I was looking for anything that was identified in that way. But, yeah, it was very much like a needle in a haystack. Dan Rooney at NARA was able to give a big assist in helping us find specifically what we were looking for. But in any event that was my first action item.  Pat Ryan: I assume that that worked fine. National Archives said, sure, we'd be happy, and they delivered. What kind of condition were these tapes in when they're, you know, 45 plus years old?  Greg Wiseman: Yeah. Actually, surprisingly, they were in great condition. And we were able to play them right away. Which isn't always the case with older tapes. At some point in the mid-70s, the tape manufacturers changed the formulation that they used for making tape. And they began using a different kind of glue. And the glue is what binds the magnetic oxide to the physical plastic tape. And over time that binder breaks down. And so whenever you load up one of these older tapes and you try to play it back, it will start shedding that magnetic oxide. And the tape will start to stick inside the machine. It won't pull smoothly across the heads. We've actually got a lot of 1/4-inch tape that suffers from that. So the way to fix it is to bake them.  Pat Ryan: Excuse me, bake them?  Greg Wiseman: Yeah. Literally, we throw it in a special little oven. And we bake them at around 135 degrees. And that sort of reactivates that binder. And reforms that bond between the magnetic oxide and the tape so that you can play the tape back. It's not a permanent fix. But it's good enough so that you can at least get the tape to play back one more time and digitize it.  Pat Ryan: And it would seem to me that that would have been a concern too. Even though the tapes were in good shape, they're still pretty old. And you don't want to have to risk playing them more times than you would need to.  Greg Wiseman: Absolutely. They're in good condition. But they're still 40 plus years old. So we really just wanted to play these back once to digitize them.  Pat Ryan: And to remind myself, we're talking about, you're talking about playing them back once so we can get everything off of them. But there's 30 tracks of audio on that tape. In order to get all 30 tracks, you would have to have a head that can read 30 different tracks all at one time. And you didn't have that.  Greg Wiseman: Right. The SoundScriber wasn't designed to play back more than two channels at a time. So we would have had to play back each tape 15 times to capture all 30 tracks. And we didn't want to put that kind of stress on the tapes. So we had to figure out a way to digitize all 30 tracks in one pass.  [ Music ]  John Hansen: And so once we got, we knew the tapes were there. I had one of my students who came down for about a four-day, five-day type week, to do some testing. We thought, well, let's put the tapes onto the playback system called SoundScriber. And let's see what we can kind of get out of this. And the playback system, actually we, again, were just expecting that you would play this back. And there's 30 tracks. So you would be able to get all 30 tracks off it once. But that was not the case. You could only get one audio track at a time. And this was a challenge for us. Because one of the things we wanted to do is we wanted to make sure that all 30 tracks were digitized at the same time. It was very important to synchronize all those tracks. So this way we could start to look across the tracks at the same instant of time.  Pat Ryan: Let me stop you for a second. The tapes that we're talking about, physical audio tapes that were recorded in 1969, in the case of Apollo 11. And 30 tracks, there are 30 different sources being recorded at the same time? Actually recorded at the same time? So they're already synced up in time because they were recorded that way?  John Hansen: Exactly. That is correct. And so—  Pat Ryan: What were the 30 sources? Did you know? Were they always the same?  John Hansen: No. Interestingly enough, NASA, when they recorded this, they had two historical recorders called HR1, HR2. Historical recorder one, historical recorder two. For each of these two recorders there's an upper and a lower recorder or a tape system; right? And the reason for that is, you know, if you're kind of recording on one historical recorder, you can't tell everyone, hey, stop. We got to switch the tapes right now. So they have two tapes. And so they'll record on the lower system. And then, when the tape's starting to run out, they'll start running tape on the other.  Pat Ryan: An overlap.  John Hansen: So there's a good overlap there. The two recorders, actually, there's some overlap in them. But there's some differences. In one of the historical recorders there's, I think three Department of Defense channels. And in the other one, there's about five Department of Defense channels, the Air Force or—  Pat Ryan: So all together maybe more than 30 channels.  John Hansen: Actually, collectively, you could look, I mean, there could be as many as 60 channels of recording of—  Pat Ryan: But not so in this case.  John Hansen: Well, so the tapes, each tape actually only has 30 tracks. Of those 30 tracks, track one is called IRIG. It's the time code. So that's the actual time that tells you, you know, for mission elapse time, exactly when things are happening. If you try listening to track one, it sounds like a squirrel is running around in your attic or something like this. It doesn't have any speech in there. So there's really 29 tracks of audio.  Pat Ryan: And did you know what those 29 sources were?  John Hansen: Yeah.  Pat Ryan: How would you characterize?  John Hansen: Yeah, so the thing that helped us a lot was because NASA's very good in documentation. And one of things they had is, on every tape, you know, there was a decal or a handwritten, you know, sticker. That basically said when this tape started. When it stopped. And then on the actual box, there's something called a heat sheet. It actually lists all the tracks. And it tells what is the code for each of those tracks. And it tells you what position the recording was done. So the position typically means the type of handset. Whether it's a head mounted headset or kind of a telephone type handset. To be honest, I don't know all of the positions of every handset but.  Pat Ryan: What I'm trying to get at I think is, did you know that, was it, for example, the crew on the moon talking to Earth on one channel? Was it the flight director talking to, was it the recording of the flight loop, the flight director's loop on another channel? Or was it people talking to each other in that control room? Or people talking to people in other rooms?  John Hansen: So each track basically is, basically you think of it as a loop; right? Now, there's typically one person that, I'll say it this way, that owns that loop; right? So there could be, for example, there's one track that's PAO. Public Affairs Office.   DOD: This is DOD; PAO.  PAO: Hi, this is Bill O'Donnell over in the news center. The name of the artist that's on the carrier is Jamieson. Is that not right?  DOD: I have to check that, sir. I believe you're right though.  PAO: Would you check it and give me call back.  John Hansen: And so that person owns that loop. And so, at least the way I say it. I don’t know if you say own it. But so you'll have other audio that's there. Another one is EECOM.  Flight Director: EECOM, Flight.  EECOM: Go Flight.  Flight Director: If we don't dump any water at all, would we be over 100 percent by entry?  EECOM: That’s confirmed flight. We’d hit at 185 hours.  John Hansen: EECOM, there's communication that's going on that loop. But while the communication is going on in that loop, there's typically other pieces that are folded into that loop. So you might have, for example, Air to Ground that's actually folded in there.   Capcom: Copy all that, Neil. And we've got a Entry PAD if you're ready to copy, over.  Buzz Aldrin: Houston, Apollo 11. Ready to copy.  Capcom: Thanks, Buzz. It’s the Entry PAD, MPL…  John Hansen: That's means, when you're talking to someone in EECOM, you're communicating with people there. But you can also hear, Capsule communicator, Capcom, talking to the astronauts. They can't hear you, but you can hear them. And so that's important because there may be something going on that you have to pay attention to. Now, that's important for the loop. It's really, really difficult for the speech technology. Because if you're attempting to try and do speech recognition and you've got Neil Armstrong, Buzz Aldrin and Collins in the background talking to the flight—  Pat Ryan: To the Capcom.  John Hansen: To Capcom, then you got to figure out, you know, who is talking to who. And where the things are. Now, fortunately, the air to ground is typically at a lower volume than the primary speakers in that loop. And so for that reason we tend to do a better job of getting just that core speech.  Pat Ryan: So I understand then, the sources, the 29 sources which might have been on either one of the two machines are the loops that are owned by the operators at the different positions in the flight control room?  John Hansen: That's correct.  Pat Ryan: Is there a conversation involved, so that would be, to use your example. The Public Affairs Officer could be talking to other public affairs people.  John Hansen: That's correct, yeah.  Pat Ryan: In their background, what they call the back room. The same thing is going on from each of the other positions. And you're recording each one of all of those positions.  John Hansen: They're all being recorded, yes.  Pat Ryan: And they're all, may have the air to ground on top of them.  John Hansen: That's correct.  Pat Ryan: They may all have the flight director loop on top of them.  John Hansen: That's correct.  Pat Ryan: The, okay.  John Hansen: So there's a lot going on. I will say that, when we first played some of the first tapes. What kind of surprised me, we picked up, I thought one that was probably PAO. And so I was a young kid at the time. But we actually picked up ABC, NBC or CBS news feed on these tapes. I didn't think that you would actually have heard that. And I heard some commercials that I remembered from 1969, you know, there. And I thought, well, this was kind of odd.  Pat Ryan: Breakfast cereals.  John Hansen: Yeah, yeah, exactly.  Pat Ryan: Dishwashing soap.  John Hansen: Smoking cigarettes.  Pat Ryan: Yeah.  John Hansen: They actually had advertisements for that.  Commercial 1: I'd walk a mile for a Camel.  Commercial 2:  If you don't buy RCA, you may be buying an obsolete color TV.  Commercial 3: [ Singing ] Take me along with you! I love you little cutie but the office is my duty!  Commercial 4:  Featuring special savings on specially equipped Fury. Valiant. Barracuda. And Belvedere models.  Commercial 5:  When you’re out of Schlitz, you're out of beer.  Pat Ryan: Well, as a PAO commentator, I'll tell you that the audio from news channels is among the different loops that people in their can listen to. So that would explain why they were there.  John Hansen: Okay.  Pat Ryan: Not making your surprise at hearing it or finding it any better. So the 30 tracks on each of these tapes are the conversations that are going on within the flight control room. As well as conversations involving flight controllers and other people who are in different rooms.  John Hansen: Yeah, back room support centers.  Pat Ryan: All that is going on at the same time.  John Hansen: Yep.  Pat Ryan: And you're finding that these reels of audio tape that have 30 tracks on them is being presented to you as, okay, you wanted it. Here it is.  John Hansen: Yeah, we got, so these were all analog tapes. And we had to figure out a way to digitize them. Once we digitized them, then we had to develop technologies that we could use to try and do what we call diarization. So I won't cover that just yet but we can talk about it.  Pat Ryan: Yeah, because I want get you to explain, to say, well, we figured out a way to digitize them and, you know, story's over. But there was a lot more to it than that.  John Hansen: Yeah. The digitizing process was something that I have to say was an unexpected challenge. Because when that came up, the fear I had was there's only one SoundScriber system that I know of. And it sits in one building, number two, here at NASA. And we didn't know if another one had existed. And so I had contacts and friends that worked in other audio spaces. The CIA actually maintains a library of all types of recording and storage systems that have existed from the beginning of storage.  Pat Ryan: Because of course they do.  John Hansen: Yeah. Well, yeah. And so I actually contacted their archive to see if they had a SoundScriber system. My thought was, well, if they had a SoundScriber system, could we rent it? Borrow it? Or somehow get it to University of Texas at Dallas. To see if we could use that to digitize them, you know, on our space. CIA doesn't have one. And so I did do a little research on SoundScriber. SoundScriber actually was an audio logging system, a company that basically did audio logging. It was primarily for police and for emergency. Like calling 911, rescue squad and so forth in the 60s. But tapes were expensive at that time. So when it got recorded, they would recycle and reuse those tapes over and over again. So it was basically a way to do a logging of the audio. NASA used it, obviously, for different purposes. It was, obviously, to capture the audio for Apollo. But what kind of, you know, really changed my perspective of things is when I went to use the SoundScriber the first time. And I said, well, how do you switch between tracks? And Greg said, well, you have this little handle. And you rotate this little wheel. And what the wheel does is it manually moves the read head up and down against the tape. So, you know, and when you rotate it, a little counter actually tells you which track the head is supposed to be on. And it mechanically changes from track two to three to four. And so you thought, okay, this was built in 1967, '68. So what are the challenges here? Well, are the motors that actually move these tapes, are they the original ones from the 1960s? What about the actual read head, is that from the 1960s? There's a little piece of rubber like a wheel that's supposed to put friction, tension on the tape.  Pat Ryan: The pinch roller.  [ding sound effect]  John Hansen: Yeah, pinch roller. And was that the original one? Because rubber oxidizes over years. So these were small little things where, you know, if you are thinking you're just going to have to develop speech technology. You don't think that you're actually going to have to roll up your sleeves and be an engineer and try to solve these things. We were concerned about digitizing only one track at a time. This was just not an option. Because I start doing some calculations. And assuming that you could digitize, you know, for a good portion of the day. Looking at, you know, maybe 30 tracks. You know, probably 10,000 hours or so. It would probably take you over 100 to maybe 150, 170 years to digitize, like, the Apollo program.  Pat Ryan: The entire Apollo program.  John Hansen: The Apollo program. And I thought, well, we don't have 170 years. We got to do this faster so.  Pat Ryan: Our grant's only for three years.  John Hansen: Yeah, it was only for three years, so.  Pat Ryan: How many tapes are we talking about?  John Hansen: So for Apollo 11, my understanding, if I remember correctly. And it's been a number of years. I think it was about 22 or 24 tapes.  Pat Ryan: And each tape had, not how much tape, but how many minutes?  John Hansen: Each tape has about 14 hours. And when you digitize, you must digitize in real-time. So that means you literally play back the tape. It takes 14 hours to play it back. If you now have—  Pat Ryan: On what, track one.  John Hansen: On track one, yeah. So now you're going to have to take that same tape and literally play it back 14 hours. So, basically, if you could digitize 14 hours in a day, it would take you 29 days to digitize one tape.  Pat Ryan: Because you don't want to digitize IRIG.  John Hansen: That's right. Right. Now, and also the thing that you have to worry about is, once you digitize it, now you've got to go back and figure out how do you actually align all those tracks? Because if you could digitize them at the same time, well, now they're automatically aligned. If you digitize them one at a time, they're not necessarily going to be aligned.  Pat Ryan: You'd have to find something that happened in each track in order to coordinate the playback.  John Hansen: Yeah. Actually would be the obvious solution that you.  Pat Ryan: Nothing, but if not the master of the obvious.  John Hansen: And one of challenges also is that it's not just the fact that you're just playing back a magnetic tape. The issue is that, over that 14 hours, you can kind of think the tape actually expands and contracts. So the playback is not necessarily exactly at the same rate. So when you, when we digitize, you know.  Pat Ryan: So that wouldn't work.  John Hansen: Yeah. So what will happen is that, if you play this back, you know, 29 times. At the end each one is going to be slightly longer or shorter than the rest.  Pat Ryan: I'm thinking that you got a bigger problem than that. You've got 50-year-old audio tapes that you're, think are going to hold up to 30 14-hour playbacks.  John Hansen: And it's quite common, I've done some work with audio archiving. We had an NSF project about ten years earlier that was called the National Gallery of the Spoken Word. So we had spent five years on that project. And it was looking at audio that had been captured from 1890s up into the, 1995 or so. And so in those types of tapes, you literally have an oven. And that was one of the things I was actually familiar with in the space that Greg Wiseman was working in where there's an oven. So if you have an analog tape, sometimes you have to bake the tape. Because there could be moisture or some other types of impurities. Or maybe the tape might stick together. So baking it actually, hopefully, allows the tape to travel more smoothly through the playback system.  Pat Ryan: So confronted with the option of 170 years worth of playback in order to digitize, you had to find another solution.  John Hansen: Yeah. And so the thing we looked for is we wanted to come up with a way of maybe designing a new read head. It was a risk we figured, well, how could we do this? So we were pretty lucky because, when we looked at the read head that was actually sitting in SoundScriber, it had a manufacturer's name on that. So from that I ended up, it was like CSI type of thing. I ended up investigating where I could go and try to find the manufacturer of that. And we kind of went through about four or five different paths. I ended up finding a company in New Jersey that actually specializes in customized recording equipment.  [ Music ]  John French: My name is John French. And our company name is JRF Magnetic Sciences, Inc. And we started this little company back around 1979. And we started off just manufacturing little components for tape recorders. And also refurbishing the tape heads.  Pat Ryan: And your business is still focused on analog recording.  John French: Almost exclusively. We service, let's see. We service recording studios. Both commercial big recording studios and also literally small personal studios that musicians run and things like that. We do a lot of service for archive facilities. One of our bigger customers is Library of Congress. We do a lot of work for, oh, colleges, institutions that have large libraries that they are archiving. Film. That's in that end of things. Then we do a lot of work with the government. We built some special machines for the FBI and the military. And custom head assemblies for film. Let's see, what else?  Pat Ryan: It's quite a range of things that you've got. You're touching in a lot of different businesses.  John French: I know. And it's basically who we are. I'm mean, we're a very small company. But, boy, we are busy.  Pat Ryan: Tell me how you and your company became involved or even aware of this deal with the Apollo mission control tapes in Houston.  John French: Well, that's, it was interesting. We received a call from a student. And I believe he was a student of John Hansen's there at the University of Texas. And when he first called, he just told me that he was trying to play back some channels on a 30-channel piece of recorded tape. And I said, well, you know, I'm going to need a little more than that. Can you tell me, you know, what the machine is? What, and so we went back and forth. And I think it probably was three or four phone calls that I finally found out that what he was really, he never did mention it in the beginning. But he told me that he was working with NASA on the Apollo tapes. Which, you know, obviously piqued my interest pretty significantly.  Pat Ryan: The tape that they were trying to deal with had 30 tracks of audio. Well, actually one was for IRIG.  John French: Right.  Pat Ryan: And their problem was that they were trying to find a way to get it to play back more than one or if not all of those tracks simultaneously?  John French: Correct.  Pat Ryan: Is that an issue that made sense to you that you got that's something I can get my teeth into?  John French: Well, so many projects, when we first start talking about them, scare the daylights out of me. But feel, because you have to consider that I don't have the machine. I have no way of testing anything. You know, projects usually don't have the budget that we can fly out to the facility and do testing and that kind of thing. So we are literally, we have to take the information that we get. And then come up with whatever solution we can work out, you know, to offer. Now, on this particular project, the initial discussion was that we were going to build a single-channel head, you know, that could play back. But they already had that, you know. I mean, that wasn't adding anything, any kind of an improvement. So what I had suggested at that time was, you know, we're probably going to want to go with a 30-channel head. I did research on other 30-channel systems. And, as I recall, I couldn't find any. So the first, the next problem was it wasn't going to be a standard head that we can pick off of, let's say a Dictaphone or one of those other systems. Because we're looking for 30 channels. And I work very closely with a head manufacturer. And I had discussed this with John about making up a three-channel head that was going to be interlaced channels. See, a 30-channel head is on a one-inch is very, very difficult. Channels are very close together. Shielding is a problem. Very, very seldom do you see a 30-channel head. Normally it would be an interlaced with 15 channels on one head being all odd channels. And 15 channels on the playback head which would be all even channels. So that was our initial idea. And, of course, we had the one track head. But we didn't know what the center-to-center spacings were. There really wasn't any information that we could sink our teeth into that, you know, we could build a 30-channel head to. I mean, that, again, would be a very expensive proposition. So what we did to start off with was we built a three-track head. Which I don't remember. I'm pretty sure it was channels 13, 15, and 17. And built that prototype head. Sent it down to NASA. And they were able to hook it up. They were able to use it. They were able to play back three channels. Which, you know, was really a breakthrough. So we had that part of it done. Next, I went back to the manufacturer. And I told them that the concept worked. And that we were going to need two 15-channel heads. Because he refused to try and build a 30-channel head. And spent about two weeks negotiating back and forth with him because there was another big expense involved with this. And that is the tooling. You need a mandrel with 15 slots for the tracks. And then 17 slots for the shields. And he said to put together a piece of tooling like that, it was many thousands of dollars. And I went back to John and told him that, you know, that I really felt like this was going to be a difficult thing to, you know, to do for any kind of reasonable price. And he said that, well, you know, get me all the pricing. And let's see where it falls. So I went back to the manufacturer and told him that they wanted to know what the total cost was going to be. And the head manufacturer said, well, on second thought, I really don't want to build that head.  Pat Ryan: Oop.  John French: I said, what? He said, John, he said, it's just too much work. You know, there's huge risk. What happens if one of these 15-channel heads fails in production? You know, I don't want to take the loss. I don't, you know, so he basically bailed out on me. And I went back to John, I said, well, we got a problem. Houston, we have a problem.  Pat Ryan: Right.  John French: And he said, well, is there anything else you can come up with? And so I told him, well, I was going to do some research. And I would let him know. And we had worked with a company over in Belgium that manufactured heads for Dictaphone. It was Applied Magnetics. And so I went to Dictaphone first. And there wasn't anybody there that could give me any information on the track placement. You know, the spacings and all that. But I went to the people in Belgium, and I told them the situation. I told them that we needed either an interlaced 30-channel head or a 30-channel head all in one. And it just so happened that he said, well, John, he said, we built a 60-channel with 30 channels on each head. They were interlaced. I said, well, what's the track format on that? And he gave me the, sent me a drawing actually.  Pat Ryan: Yeah.  John French: And the spacing on the, each channel center to center was extremely close to what we had calculated out the NASA tapes to be. So, anyway, the cost on that head, what happened was, he said, well, you're not going to believe this. But we only have one 30-channel head in stock. It's the last one. We're not building any more. And, you know, we only have one. So it's, doesn't have its mate to make it a 60 channel. So we've been, you know, he told us they'd been keeping it in case there was a system failure. And, you know, they could support it. But it had been a number of years, and the thing was still in stock. So they gave us a very good price on it. I went back to John, explained what we had found. Of course, you know, everybody was really concerned that the tracking was going to be correct. That, you know, the crosstalk. And, you know, there were a number of conversations regarding whether or not this head would actually work. So the long and the short of it is we decided to bite the bullet. And I ordered the head. The head came in. We made up a mounting base for it. It actually came with cables and connectors. And it really a real find to actually have as much of the head that we needed, you know.  Pat Ryan: Right.  John French: So, anyway, it came in. We mounted it up. I set it up, alignments, you know. So that the azimuth and all was correct in wrap and everything. Sent it down to them. And as I understand it, it just worked beautifully.  Pat Ryan: The new 30-track playback head found and retrieved from a warehouse shelf in Belgium did work beautifully. Just not right away. Hansen's team was up against another new problem in trying to integrate this piece of hardware into the SoundScriber. That's where we'll pick up next time.

                        "description": "Pat Ryan: Houston, We Have a Podcast. Welcome to the officeial podcast of the NASA Johnson Space Center, Episode 92, Apollo 10. I’m Pat Ryan.  On this podcast we talk with scientists, and engineers, and astronauts and lots of other folks about their part in America’s space exploration program, and today we’re taking another look into NASA’s past on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of Apollo 10. When President Kennedy set a goal for America to land a man on the moon and return him safely to Earth by the end of the decade, there was less than nine years left in the 1960s, so NASA had to move efficiently.  The first manned Apollo flight didn’t happen until October of 1968, and it didn’t leave Earth orbit; when Apollo 8 circled the moon that December there was only one year left to meet the president’s challenge!  The first test of the lunar module in Earth orbit came in March 1969, and then on May 18 they launched Apollo 10, the final dress rehearsal for the moon landing, which of course came in late July. Apollo 10 showed NASA what it had done right in its effort to meet the president’s deadline, and what it needed to refine to finish the job. And it provides lessons for today’s NASA as it works under a new challenge from the administration to get back to the moon in a few short years.  That was the discussion by a select panel of experts here at the Johnson Space Center a few weeks ago, which we’ve packaged up for your enjoyment, forthwith. To talk about that Apollo mission of 50 years ago, you’re about to hear from General Tom Stafford, the mission commander and the only surviving member of that crew. John Young and Gene Cernan walked on the moon later, on Apollos 16 and 17, respectively, while Stafford commanded the Apollo half of the Apollo-Soyuz Test Project in 1975.  He’s joined on the panel by Bernie Rosenbaum, who worked as a propulsion engineer during the Apollo era; by Lara Kearney, the deputy manager of the Gateway Program office here at JSC, they’re the folks developing a spaceport to enable future lunar surface missions and missions to Mars; and by NASA astronaut Randy Bresnik, a veteran of two spaceflights including a five-month tour of duty to the International Space Station on Expeditions 52 and 53. The panel was hosted by NASA’s Annette Hasbrook, a former flight director during the space shuttle and space station era who then served as chief of the spaceflight training office at JSC before moving into her current job as assistant manager for program integration for the Orion Program, which is developing America’s first deep space crew vehicle.  As we listen in, you’ll hear her asking the panel members to talk about what they each see as the lessons of Apollo 10. So, here we go!  [Music]     Annette Hasbrook: To set us up I'd like to set the environment for the panel.  The Apollo 10 mission was a pivotal mission in the history of human spaceflight and it was the first flight of a complete crewed Apollo spacecraft to operate around the moon.  The mission objectives included a scheduled eight-hour lunar orbit of the separated lunar module and descent to about nine miles off the moon's surface before ascending for rendezvous and docking with the command and service module in about a 70-mile circular lunar orbit.  Because of the success of Apollo 10 in late May 1969 humanity landed on the moon less than two months later on July 20th, 1969.  The reason we're here today is to reflect on the lessons and legacies of the Apollo 10 mission, to take a moment to note that we all have aerospace jobs that only exist because we stand on the shoulders of the giants on this stage, and in the audience today, and to recognize how these lessons can assist our future plans to go forward to the moon and on to Mars.  But first off we need General Stafford to give us a brief synopsis of how this whole program started and what the strategies were used to make sure it funded, was funded.  General?  Tom Stafford: Alright. You can hear me all right?  Good. Well, I want to thank all the people here, the Snoopy Award winners and also the Schulz family, for what the Charles Schulz did, Snoopy and the um…we named the, in fact I was one who chose the name Snoopy and then Cernan said, yes, we'll go down and snoop around moon…but, and then naturally, Snoopy, we had to have a name of the other spacecraft so Charlie Brown was a natural.  But let me take you back to how everything got started, why did we have Apollo? The new president we had there in 1960 election, Kennedy, you know, wanted to do new and forward-looking things, but he goes back before that to Sputnik, and the Senate Majority Leader was Lyndon Johnson from Texas, and when the Soviets orbited Sputnik he really came on hard on Eisenhower, Nixon his vice president, as we let the Soviets get way ahead of us, and so there's a big push in science and technology throughout the United States, at universities, to go you know really get with the science.  And also it started the ballistic missile race, and the Air Force had General Schriever aiding our efforts, who was a giant; he's like Sergei Korolev was to the Soviet Union at that time.  And so things were up and running but also President Johnson, then Senate Majority Leader, put through a bill calling for a National Space Council that could be activated and deactivated by the president, and the vice president would be the chairman of it.  Well, Eisenhower for some reason thought it would jeopardize his position so he never activated it, but Lyndon Johnson was a real pusher, he kept going and pushing on it.  Then he was vice president after the election, and the first thing President Kennedy did was to activate the National Space Council with Lyndon Johnson as the head of it, and it was like a fast-moving freight train down the track with Johnson there, believe me.  So then the next item that occurred was when Yuri Gagarin, on April the 12th 1961, did one orbit around the [Earth], and Johnson and Kennedy saw the great accolades of the world to the Soviet Union and Yuri Gagarin.  And then following that on May the 5th Alan Shepard did a little suborbital flight on a Redstone Mercury combination.  He went 215 miles downrange, flew over a hundred miles an hour. So right, within three days after that, President Kennedy went to Vice President Johnson, said Mr. Vice President, I want an answer in two and two and a half weeks, what this country can do that will put us ahead of the Soviet Union, that is very meaningful and will show accomplishments that this nation leads the world, that will put us ahead technically, economically, and challenge us.  And Lyndon Johnson was no shrinking violet; he said yes, Mr. President I'll do that.  He put together a committee that had Robert Gilruth, first director of the [Manned Spacecraft] Center, Wernher von Braun, the director at Marshall, Abe Silverstein from, the director of Ames, Max Faget, who designed our Mercury, Gemini, Apollo and the space shuttle.  This group, and so in two and a half weeks Lyndon Johnson came back to President Kennedy and said, Mr. President, looks like there’s three types of, what we determined.  Number one, there is no way we can beat the Soviet Union in a free-return trajectory around the moon—in other words a highly elliptical orbit, will go around and moon and come back, with a very little maneuvering.  And then they can say the Soviet Union has been to the moon, they flew around it, and the average person in France or Japan or China they wouldn't know the difference.  The Soviets have been to the moon; there's no way we can beat them.  And that's exactly what the Soviets started to do with their Zond program: it was a Soyuz without the orbital ball on the front on top of a Proton rocket.  Number two, we think there's only a 50/50 chance that we can equal them or maybe beat them on orbiting the moon.  But number three, if we go and land on the moon and return to the Earth, that will definitely be ahead of the Soviet Union; it'll be bigger, more expensive, and it’ll put us way ahead technically. And right away, Kennedy thought for a couple of minutes, said “we'll do that.”  Now that took courage because the launch success out of the Cape was about 40%--in other words we had about 60% failure of our boosters.  So the next, but also he was very smart politically: that evening he called in the leaders of the Congress like Sam Rayburn, the speaker of the House, Albert Thomas, the [chairman] of Appropriations who happen to be from Houston, Carl Albert, a whip from Oklahoma, Senator Kerr from Appropriations, from Oklahoma.  He called into kingmakers so the skids were greased with those leaders, and then the next day he had the joint session of the Congress and told the Congress that before this decade is out we will land a man on the moon and safely return.  So that is what started Apollo. So we had the goal; the next question is how do we go to the moon? Now that became a big fight between Johnson's people, well then the Manned Space Flight Center and Marshall.  The, what Dr. Gilruth wanted was this giant booster.  We've all seen the Saturn V here, weighed six and a quarter million pounds fully-loaded, but this thing would be about fourteen million pounds.  You'd, it’d go and drop off stages, land erect, and I don't know how it being so big how the people would get out, maybe rappel down  we'll have something out of there and then take off dropping stages and come back.  Von Braun had a different idea: he wanted to take two boosters, probably one and a half the size of a Saturn V, launch one launch the second, rendezvous in orbit even though nobody had done a rendezvous and then leave again dropping off stages, land erect and come back dropping off stages direct.  There was a top engineer from Langley Research Center named John Huebel and his team, they said no: the way to go is go do a lunar orbit rendezvous.  And he kept writing papers.  Fortunately, the deputy administrator of NASA, Dr. Robert Seamans, who had been the former dean of aeronautics and astronautics at MIT, was a very technical man and he understood it, that this is the way to go.  It would be faster, it would less cost, it would be safer, you'd do it quicker.  So anyway it was finally fourteen months after President Kennedy said go, in July 1962, it was decided and announced to the world the way that we will go to the moon is using a lunar orbit rendezvous. And so, from that, that was the decision.  I was very fortunate, I joined in the second group of astronauts who came on board about two months after that.  And so we had, it was decided we needed to train the, we need to demonstrate this, so how do we demonstrate it?  So that, we started the Gemini program after the Apollo, so…and the biggest booster we had was the Titan II booster, [ICBM] it was an intercontinental ballistic missile, and it had the Mark 6 nine-megaton warheads.  I don't know if any of you know what nine megatons is, that's nine million tons of TNT, or if you put it in pounds remember nine is, ten, megatons is nine times ten to the 6 and there's 2,000 pounds to a ton so two times ten to the third, multiply it out, it had a warhead that had eighteen billion pounds of TNT.  It was a big warhead.  And so we took off the nine megaton warhead and put on an eighteen-and-a-half foot, eight-thousand pound Gemini.  And Gemini was the first spacecraft that could maneuver in orbit, could change its orbit; Mercury could only change its attitude, it had three little solid rockets in order to give it a impulse retrograde of about 320 seconds and that would bring it down.  But Gemini we could raise and lower our altitude, change planes to some extent, and do all types of maneuvers. So we know from history now that the Gemini put us way ahead of the Soviet Union in our total sequence, and from that I was very fortunate to be assigned with Wally Schirra to demonstrate the first rendezvous in space.  But during this period of time a great team was put together.  We were very fortunate to have Dr. von Braun and about 250 of his German people from Peenemunde and he developed a great team there at Huntsville; here we had Dr. Gilruth and he brought in some great engineers like, from all over: Chris Kraft we had, so many people, like this gentleman, and, you know, to meet that goal.  It was a 70 or 80 hour work week; [in] fact 40 hours was a vacation!  [laughter]  And so we, we started like that, and but also one of the keys we brought in General Sam Phillips, he was a two-star then, but he had managed the B-52 program, and then General Schriever had recruited him and he was a program management for the Minuteman missile, was our, our, I mean he put in the ground a thousand Minuteman missiles, he started the program, and he was brilliant.  He was a fighter pilot in World War II flying P-38s, had dogfights with Messerschmitt 109s, ME-190s, lots of 88-millimeter flak around him, and he was a veteran but he had a lot of common sense.  And personality-wise we hit it off pretty good so I had a great working relationship with General Phillips. I want to relay you the way he thought.  He told me, when you look at a problem you use common sense, but also you have to think out of the box, and a good example was the Minuteman silos, you know were sprinkled around out fields, they were unattended; you'd have a launch control center with ten silos miles apart around, and, but we had to be sure they were secure.  Boeing was the prime contractor so they had written up a plan, and they had a national security company [inaudible], to do their security, so they came up with a big book had the thing all installed; this was it, certified.  Well, you know, in software you do IV&V, independent verification and validation; well, General Phillips wanted to do an IV&V on the security of those Minuteman silos, we had a Minuteman 1.  So what did he do, did he go to another security agency another techno…he went to the Federal Bureau of Prisons and said I want the best bank robbers you have that are in your prison.  And so he got eight convicts, and he said he didn't want the ones who went into the bank with a firearm, he wanted once it broke in mechanically.  So they rounded those people up, they went out to the silo with guards, turned them loose.  Now remember, this was guaranteed, nobody can get in there.  And General Phillips told me that within 30 or 45 minutes those eight convicts were done all over that Minuteman silo [laughter], in the umbilical feed rooms down at the flame trench, the whole thing.  So that's, so they pulled them out and fixed all the deficiencies they could see and then later he sent them back in, this time it took about three and a half hours to get done in the Minuteman silo; they fixed those.  So that’s how you think out of the box, and that always left an impression on me.  And from that, for every program I was on I was always thinking out of the box, and that later as I'll explain led to color TV but, I kind of used him and Von Braun as my model, that's how you manage programs.  Annette Hasbrook: Wow, fantastic.  So, Bernie and Lara and Randy can you briefly reflect on the importance of Apollo 10 and how that impacted your lives and how you believe that impacted humanity.  Bernie Rosenbaum: Oh okay—it’s on—okay, I think as the general just mentioned here each, each one was a stage, stepping-stones on, on the previous one, and every one, every, I mean we, whoever set up those overall activities of Mercury, Gemini, and then Apollo and the various stages of those really thought the thing through because each one added to the next one, no, no one was more important than the other, they were all important in series.  So I think that's what it really does, its, it really helped get to where we did one, on Apollo 11, very quickly.  Lara Kearney: I would say, you know, building on what Bernie just said, Apollo in general just inspired humanity, right? NASA was doing what was deemed impossible, in my opinion, on behalf of the world, and it was, it was that series of missions that was successful at the end of the day.  But as you guys saw in the video, right, this mission did some really brave stuff, right, to get out there and have to change orbits, to descend, to land, to find that spacecraft that you had to rendezvous with, that was like really gutsy at the time and they were brave enough to take that challenge and, and go for it regardless of the risks so, to me that's a lot of the lesson learned that I'd like to see bring back into our culture is just that really bold, brave willingness to go do stuff that you know we haven't done before.  Randy Bresnik: And as a test pilot as well, what Apollo 10 did and inspired me, and was inspirational, was the fact these guys were the consummate test flight.  They had, as flight test plan they needed to go execute, they needed to get all the data, bring it back so that the next step could happen which was just two months later, the moon landing.  And so, imagine, you know, General Stafford and Gene Cernan in Snoopy, they've come 250,000 miles from Earth and all of a sudden now they are nine miles away from the surface; I mean, if the moon had grass they could kind of reach their hand out the window kind of touch the blades, they were that close.  And you know, to not go down to the surface, you know, certainly is challenging but it’s that discipline of the flight test, executing the flight test plan is certainly what is, you know, really cognizant and a good reminder for, for all of us in executing our test plans.  And as a, as an aside, you know, I always thought, you know, there's all these stories and, about how test pilots push the envelope sometimes, maybe too much, and how the, when General Stafford and Geno were in Snoopy that it must have been tempting for them to maybe just go a little farther than that fifty thousand feet, and so the stories are, at least the ones that I've heard that, you know, the LEM was made too heavy so they couldn't do that or there wasn't enough fuel put on board for them to go down to the bottom and come back up, so they would not be tempted to do that so maybe General Stafford can fill us in on you know what the reality was at that point   [Laughter]  Annette Hasbrook: So, General Stafford, during the Apollo 10 re-entry you and your crew were recognized by the Guinness Book of Records reaching the highest speed ever attained by man, so real speed demons I've been told: Mach 37.  It's the speed record that still stands today and we may not exceed it until we bring humans back from Mars, so thinking about that what was the main difference between your training and your experience in re-entry and what advice do you have for enhancing future training for our astronauts as we go to the moon and then on to Mars?   Tom Stafford: Well, on re-entry, we knew it was also a test of the heat shield even though we'd, on one of the big Saturn V unmanned tests we had tested up close to that velocity, there really wasn't any difference between the simulator and what we did.   But we entered at nighttime over the South Pacific and you know the heat is a function of the square of the velocity, and for example, Earth orbit coming in the stagnation point on the leading edge say the shell that was about 3100 degrees; well, at that speed we came in the, our heat shield was about 6400 degrees, and so it was, but we left a flame of trail and you could see it from the ground as we came across American Samoa it was so bright you could nearly read a newspaper at night.  And we landed but we pulled about seven and a half g’s for quite a while to get subcircular.  I know we're doing 36,000 feet per second, more than that, and then we were right in the middle of the fireball, you know, maneuvering to get the vectors matched to come in, right to the aim point, and we're down to 30,000 feet per second then down to 28, we saw 25,000 feet per second we knew we were coming in, we had a capture, and coming on in. So really it wasn't any different from a simulation. One of the real keys to our success was the simulation.  We had, we pioneered simulation in the space program here, starting with Mercury which is really more of a procedure change.  The first real good procedures or simulator was the Gemini program: we had a digital simulator and how we did to rendezvous, we also had a hybrid simulator up at McDonnell Aircraft and worked out that.  But again you work out backup charts and you always think how to do something better, how can you do it faster, and so I don't know how many, fifty or sixty simulations we had for re-entry, just time and time again.  And failure modes, different thrusters failing.  So it wasn’t, it wasn't any different.  Annette Hasbrook: So, training like you fly is really a key, and we should carry that on going into the future.  Tom Stafford: I was integrated with the Mission Control Center here and it worked out super.  Annette Hasbrook: Awesome.  Bernie, talk a little bit about the design challenges on a, of the Apollo 10 spacecraft and things that impacted engineering and testing and possible impacts that could have happened and what you all did thinking about that.  Bernie Rosenbaum: Well, I mean Apollo 10 was no more unique than, than all the other systems that we developed.  I worked in the reaction control group which was responsible for the attitude control and the OHMS maneuvering systems on both Gemini and Apollo, and when we first started on that the technology status was really, really low, we didn't realize how serious the problems were.  We used two propellants that were hypergolic and these propellants as soon as you, as soon as they make contact with each other they react and at ambient temperatures you get up together in less than milliseconds you have a fire.  So they was really great.  The problem, though, was—and the flame temperature of that stuff was about 5000, 5500 degrees so you had to use special materials to avoid the stuff literally melting away and we still couldn't reach those things so we used a lot of film cooling on, on the walls to keep them cool.  And the commandents—or the Gemini and command module used ablative engines which are engines that are cooled from the inside there, basically it's a fiberglass wrap that as the heat soaks into them you gas, gas leak inside which provides a cooling to the, to the inner surface.  The LEM and command module were radiation-cooled engines, and because of the high temperature requirements those were made out of molybdenum which is a fairly brittle material, and that became a real problem for us.  This, the real serious problem is these propellants, when you look at them in a vacuum environment, if you're making long pulses the propellants come in and they react immediately because there's conditi—additional propellants coming in and things lights up and you have a nice glowing chamber there in not too many seconds.  But when we're doing attitude control, particularly like if they're trying to align for stars, you want real short pulses and we have pulses down to 13 milliseconds.  And when you look at the kinetics of what's going on, the first propellants coming in it's in a vacuum so it flashes, cools, and slows down the reaction rate.  And these two propellants will never there, mix real poorly like that it forms a material called hydrazine nitrate which is something like TNT; it just accumulates in there. And we had, I can't tell you how many times we had engines blow up: you make a series of short pulses and then all at once it would just light up and the whole thing go off like shrapnel.  And solving that problem was our biggest challenge and it took us some years to do that.  And the way we ended up solving the problem was we had to put heaters, pretty good-sized heaters, on the system to keep the, to keep the propellants from getting too cold and accumulating in there.  And the other thing is we come up with a system which, basically we called it a pre cup, it was a small engine within the main engine and it was such that the fluid dynamics whenever they would, you’d first open the valves, the fluid would go directly into the small chamber in the middle which is a small rocket engine, it would start reacting and then it would, the chamber was small enough that the pressure built up and so it made a lot less of this accumulation of this explosive material and then concurrently the propellants coming around the main manifold comes out into the chamber and the thing would go ahead and light.  And so it, those two things together really solve the problem.  Here's a section drawing of the engine—I don't know if you folks can see from back there or not—but these are the two valves that brought it in and here's this little engine in the middle we called the pre cup, and that went a long way towards solving it.  But we, we had tests that, that, we were worrying about that thing shattering and so one of the things we did was I went up to LEM, to Bethpage and got a couple panels of windows and we had a program with the explosive research lab in Pittsburgh and we set these windows up around it, and here's another chamber this is the chamber we actually used for testing, just the stainless chamber, but you can see how it's all ballooned out here, this is one where we had an ignition delay in it and when it went off it just literally ballooned this out.  So we used this in, as an example of the type of energy that was stored there so we made other test chambers like this and we put in TNT on some just tissue paper in there and they tried various amounts of it on several stages to get this same type of deformation.  He said okay, that's probably a pretty good calibration of it, and then we took a real chamber like this, put the same TNT mixture inside and detonated it against the windows and the windows did not break so that gave us confidence that we, we had that problem pretty well solved.  Annette Hasbrook: That is truly amazing, and for kids who are growing up, you do get to blow things up when you're an engineer, so that's awesome.  Study hard in school. [laughter]  So, General Stafford and or Bernie, during the Apollo 10 you know we understand that the launch trajectory was so precise that we only had to have one mid-course correction so, and this was done in the time before what we call, you know, the heavy computing capabilities that we have today, the era before modern computing.  So what lessons should our Orion and Gateway teams learn from, from this for calculating trajectories as we go on to the Moon and Mars.   Tom Stafford: Well today, with our computing efforts, I think we have it down cold what we can do as far as going into Earth orbit, and then JPL has done such a fantastic job over the years on understanding the exact trajectory of the planets, what it takes to get there.  You see the New Horizons has gone past Pluto, all that, so it's, I don't think we have any problem as far as the trajectory out there.  The main thing is systems reliability and the protection from radiation.  And I got involved…one thing I'd like to bring out is, leadership starts at the top.  And like President Kennedy said, we'll go to the moon, and that was followed through, and Johnson, and Nixon finally stopped it but, it wasn't smooth all the way.  After the tragic fire we had there in January of 1967, in the Senate, led by Walter Mondale was a senior senator from Minnesota, later the vice president to Jimmy Carter, he led a big fight to kill the Apollo program.  He was going to take the money he said put it in education.  And I got my first involvement in talking with both houses: Jim Webb, who was probably our greatest administrator, sent three of us.  Wally Schirra would be the commander of the first Apollo flight after the fire—we rearranged the crews—I was a backup commander and Frank Borman was on the accident board. He sent us individually around and we talked to the chairmen of the key committees around.  I won't use the word “lobby,” I'll use the word “educate” the good elected representatives of the United States people. [laughter] But we really worked that, and of course Lyndon Johnson had a lot of horsepower, he came in and argued.  So, Mondale didn't stand a chance, but him and a small group of senators tried to kill Apollo; they were swept aside.  But that was the first thing.  And then, President Nixon started the space shuttle, and then we had Skylab come in between as a follow-on, and the, President Reagan started the space station, under his…but then President George [H.W.] Bush said on the 20th anniversary of the first lunar landing, where we had a big event at the Air and Space Museum and a barbecue at the White House South Lawn, that, after, we’ll complete the space station—had to be redesigned, but—after the turn of the century return to the moon, and he said this time to stay, and then the second decade perhaps an expedition or two to Mars.  Well, that was great except the two houses were of the opposite party and then when President Clinton came in he, right away he said, hey, that was Bush's program that's not my program, mission is dead.  So we had to, the space exploration, that's when I really got involved with a lot of volunteer work, I was asked by President Bush, Vice President Quayle, to head this study, it's called America at the Threshold, we had eleven months, I had two floors of people over in Crystal City, George Abbey was my deputy, who was a great center director here.  George is somewhere here—thank you, George—let’s give George a hand.  [Applause]   And we use, like in our designed the components out of the Saturn V upgraded engines, but where the Saturn V would put than 300,000 pounds to low Earth orbit and a hundred thousand pounds after translunar injection on the way to the moon, this would put 550,000 pounds to low Earth orbit with the increased engines, nearly 300,000 pounds on TLI or on out to Mars.  But as soon as Clinton came in he killed it.  So if the president isn't behind it, you're not going to go anywhere.  So for eight years exploration was absolutely zero.  In fact I talked to Dan Goldin, the administrator, and said we can't even talk about exploration. Well, after Clinton left George W. Bush came in and after about three years—he was tied up for the first three years with conflict in Afghanistan and Iraq—so but after three plus years he set kind of the same goal as his father, not to the same funding level but we're going to go back to the moon on to Mars.  So that started, so we had about, around five years of really going for exploration.  And Mike Griffin became the administrator, Doug Cooke, who a lot of you know, was here heading exploration but there he's associate administrator, and they had a booster—not as big as what we outlined when George and I were running the Synthesis Group—it’d put around 410,000 thousand pounds to low Earth orbit; that’s still a hefty payload out there.  And then Barack Obama comes in as president and he didn't just cancel it like that, he had a study done.  The study didn't say cancel it, but it was done with some, with Obama and the Obamaites he had batted NASA around, and that got killed.  So for really eight more years, there’s sixteen years we've had zero exploration. And now President Trump has set a goal, he reactivated the space council, which is great, with Vice President Pence in charge. So, I'm not a Nostradamus to say who will win the election in 2020, but if President Trump is re-elected we'll continue on.  He set a goal for landing on the moon.  He said boots, and he doesn't mean one left boot and one right boot, that boots, he means more than one person on the moon by 2024.  So this center has its work cut out for us and we got to do the right thing, we got to think out of the box. Let me make one more comment, too.  You know, when I was assigned Apollo 10 to be the first lunar module out there, all we’d had on Apollo 7 was a black-and-white fuzzy TV camera; we had it on 8, the first lunar orbit the George Low pushed to beat the Soviets, and 9 which is an Earth orbit with Spider and Gumdrop, the first lunar module.  So when I came off of the back up on the first Apollo flight, after October, starting mid-November, I said when are we gonna have color TV?  Well, NASA had a program that was a three, or said three or four years we will have a color TV; I said baloney.  I said a few other things that I’ll not repeat since we have a mixed audience.  [laughter]  I said we can do it, said we're better than that, we can do it a hell of a lot faster than that.  So I talked to Chris Kraft and talked to Sam, General Sam Phillips, I had a good relationship with him, said I want to really push this, said it shouldn't be that difficult.  So, we determined the videcon camera we needed was a low-light level videcon that was classified in Vietnam, so I called General Phillips: we got two of them declassified about that fast.  There was, they had five lenses in  France that had the dynamic range—I don't know why they were in France but—we got two of those, so we had that but how do you get color?  You know, the early TV sets, remember those big sets we had?  They had, they had color guns, red blue yellow, the three basic colors; we didn't have one.  And one of the groups said, hey, let's go back to the first TV set ever invented, it had a rotating color wheel of red, blue, and yellow.  So we got an old actuator about this big off a Minuteman missile driving a color wheel, so, and basically between three and a half and four months we developed this first color TV and we put it on board Apollo 10 about a week before launch, started running integrated tests with the control center, it worked good.  So we launched and then the first color TV you saw is when we exploded off the command module, came back in and docked with the lunar module to take it away from the third stage S-IVB; as we came in to dock like that you could see this thin aluminum cover on the top of the lunar module Snoopy and the resolution of that TV was so high you could see the rivets in that thing and you could see it shake as we got to soft dock, then hard dock it really shake, and then we turned around and…but see, you had to think out of the box.  So, instead of three years plus, we did it in three and a half months.  And we got to have thinking like that if we're going to get to the moon in 2024. But one funny thing that came out…we're feeling pretty high and we were sending pictures of the Earth back and by the end of the day the Earth was slightly bigger than a basketball, and so I was thinking kind of wiseass so I said, oh say I want you to relate to the president of the British Flat Earth Society in London he's wrong—you can see here it’s a beautiful round Earth, it's round.  So we went to sleep that night, put up the windows; next morning the Earth looked smaller than a soccer ball, between a soccer ball and a grapefruit.  And they're reading up the morning news and the second article was from the—a message from the president of the British Flat Earth Society, and he said he had a message for Colonel Stafford.  He said, yes I saw a beautiful round picture of the Earth; yes the Earth is round, but it's a flat disk.  Annette Hasbrook: Aw, that’s great.  So Randy, as we prepare to go forward to the moon and on to Mars, what can the employees here at JSC do to help prepare our crews and our control centers and our infrastructure for this new mission?  Randy Bresnik: Well certainly everybody needs to keep doing what they're doing.  The dedication, the professionalism, the attention to detail that got us finishing up the flying of the space shuttle program, completion of the assembly of the International Space Station, you know, nineteen years now of continuous human presence in space, everything we're doing is good.  Now, to make the 2024 goal happen, though, we got to take that experience and transition it because we can't keep doing business as usual.  We need to figure out ways to be more efficient and do things more quickly.  And so, you know, procurements, the building of the spacecraft, testing the spacecraft, has to be done more quickly and more efficiently, and so we need everybody's good ideas on that because you guys are the experts on those particular things and you know where the improvements can be made.  So the time for good ideas is not past, the time is now to bring those good ideas forward so we can make 2024 a reality.    [Applause]  Annette Hasbrook: So General, when you and Gene entered the lunar module and prepared for the undocking maneuver, what was your level of confidence that that lunar module would operate, and what was the comm between you and Mission Control like?  Tom Stafford: Oh, our confidence: 100%.  We'd been through the testing in the altitude chamber and also while it was being built in Long Island. So I didn't have any qualms at all about the thing would operate real good.  The, the only system you wonder about was a probe and drogue.  We had three little prongs, you could see it in the museum, and that was what held the, the drogue, and over on the lunar module, on the probe.  And so when you dump the pressure, well, we had a little quality control problem on the Apollo command module.  Many of you have taken engineering drawing, you look at three dimensions, and when you look where you see a hole through a thing from a different view it’ll be a dotted line; well, we had a non-propulsive vent, so when John Young turned to vent the tunnel after we were in there it wouldn't vent, so here we were hooked on, five pounds per square inch over an area about this big, the tunnel, and it held my three little probes, and we'd had a series of failures of that test, of that, of that probe, and so we're hanging on by those three little things and the lunar module started to twist a little bit.  But Mission Control said we think it should work, so okay, here we go, we undocked.  You got a little push because we had five psi over a big area.  And so the main thing was coming back in I sure hope those three little capture probes work; if not we'd have to do a spacewalk, an EVA, to get back into the command module, which would be rather a tough task, but that was the only systems problem.  Annette Hasbrook: Great, awesome.  So Lara, with the upcoming Commercial Crew flights and the first crewed flights of Orion, what lessons can we learn from our Apollo era employees on how to safely fly dynamic and daring missions?  Lara Kearney: Let's see, so I think there's probably several different aspects to that question.  I mean just from a hardware perspective, we take a lot of the lessons learned directly from Apollo: you can see the heritage in Orion's heat shield and the parachutes, in several of the systems, we certainly took a lot of lessons learned, like General Stafford said, from the Apollo 1 fire, we, we know how now to treat materials, what kind of environments are best from an oxygen and partial pressure perspective, so just technically we, we have certainly taken a lot of those lessons learned.  Culturally, again, I think it's important that we kind of start thinking a little bit more like they did.  You've heard both Komrade and General Stafford talk about things like fighter pilot, test pilot mentality, risk-taking mentality; I think we've kind of gotten away from that a little bit and need to get kind of a little more back to the edgy, edgy way of the way explorers think, the guys that climb mountains and go to the South Pole start thinking a little bit more like that.  You've heard General Stafford say several times leadership starts at the top; I can tell you from what I'm seeing we certainly have a lot of support, not only from the White House but down even to NASA Headquarters they are really blew, blowing and moving and going to try and make all of this work.  We have taken a lot of the lessons learned.  We, from a Gateway perspective, and I know landers are gonna be the same way, we are sitting on an incredibly diverse and talented workforce that can take the lessons learned from everything we have from space station, everything we have from Orion, everything we have from Commercial Crew, and be able to fold all of that into these lunar programs.  We just need to harness all of that and, and be efficient with how we go forward, so, we do have a lot of teams working on trying to help us with what I think a lot of us would consider things like bureaucracy and red tape, and we're trying to kind of push that down and see how fast we can start to move.  And again, I think that's a lesson learned from Apollo, again it's just the top-down leadership to try and make things possible for the workforce to be successful.  Tom Stafford: Let me bring up a point, say it’s kind of a counter philosophy.  Under the Obama administration, it was decided they would have Commercial Crew, and having been through such a great success we had, I have a dim view of it because it's basically, here, we'll build a spacecraft and come and look at it.  And I think the Orion is like we did Apollo, where Randy's out working with the spacecraft, and not like this.  In other words everything NASA did in Gemini and Apollo we bought from commercial companies, except we had NASA engineers like you and all of us working right there with them, where now under this commercial idea it’s different.  And if you want an interesting mathematical exercise, you know, fraction, the numerator over the denominator; go take a look at the dollars on the top, what we're paying for a launch of commercial cargo, divided by the pound, and see what it is.  And you go look at the shuttle it was, the shuttle ran about $450 million a launch, could carry 31,000 pounds, and you also had a plus, a crew of seven, over here on the side.  Just make a comparison; I think you'll find it interesting.  Annette Hasbrook: Alright.  And speaking of Gemini, Bernie, during Gemini 8 they had a yaw OHMS thruster that was fired erratically and it was believed due to a short circuit in the wiring, so what were the lessons of Gemini 8 that you applied to the reaction control system in Apollo 10 and 11 to ensure mission success.  Bernie Rosenbaum: Well, the problem on Gemini is that they switched the valves on the ground side; they went from the circuit breaker directly to the solenoid, back out of the solenoid, the ground wire going back and the switch was down there.  And somewhere in that section of wire either a hose clamp was too tight or wire was crossed, but that was apparently made, it was a conscious decision because they had a real weight problem on Gemini and they didn't want to have the extra wires in it that they had to, if they had put it on the other side it was going to take additional weight.  And that apparently was the reason why they had it that way.  And that was changed on Apollo so that was not there. How much more time do we have, because they're just a couple points I'd like to make that…hmm, okay, just so I'd like to like to talk about two other things.  Annette Hasbrook: Okay, go ahead.  Bernie Rosenbaum: Okay.  What I want to do is, is talk about how people can empower, how you should feel empowered when you see something that's not quite right.  Take the action and don't worry about the consequence of it.  You're out there trying to solve a problem.  And I mean, like to sight an example that could have changed history. One of the fellows, our response, our group was responsible for the pyrotechnics…igniters…and one of the fellows who had, was working in the group had worked for the Navy for a while and knew the igniters that were being used on the lunar trainer for the, for the seat ejection seats, and he was suspicious of a problem once.  So he went to Henry Pohl, who was director of our group, he went direct that same afternoon, he went to Bob Gilruth directly and they told him the problem, Bob says we are grounding the fleet until we, until Bob certifies that we have good igniters.  And I don't know how long it was grounded, because I know the crew was fussing about they wouldn't be out there training for it, but shortly after that Bob said okay, they're all okay, Neil's in one and Neil had to bail out because of a problem.  And had that had a bad igniter on it, history would've been different.  So the point is when you feel there's a problem, take action: don't wait for someone. Another example was that, we, I got a call from somebody in the program office saying that they just saw the design change come through where they changed the bolts on the, that hold the head on the hydraulic pumps from a standard bolt to a dry lube bolt, and if you have a dry lube bolt you need to change the torque spec.  So I didn't think a whole lot about it and she said I want you to go up in Abex, it was an Abex pump that was being built for the solid, the SRB, not orbiter.  So I says well, I don't think it's a prob, we don't, we have an issue with it because we're not changing ours out but I said I will go check it out.  So I go up to Abex, went up to the chief engineer's office, told the guy why I was there, he says come on, we’ll go back we're tear, we’re building pumps right now.  And they, and they rebuild them every flight, because, after they take them out of the water.  And they, he says we’re taking them apart right now, so I, we walked back and the guy had just literally pulled the top of the pump off, he took off the part that had an insert on it; they had real heavy-duty inserts, helical type inserts, in the aluminum so that, because—and there was a big [inaudible] with real square threads on it, and the thing had, was, I could look at the thing and I said, well that thing is slightly above the surface.  And long story short, I suspected we had the thing, they'd sheared the inserts because they used the old torque to tighten bolts, and it should have used a much, much reduced torque.  So I said to the chief engineer there I said, hey, be interesting to slice that thing in half and see what it looks like inside.  So we, okay, we go down the lab we do it, cut it in half, they made a photo micrograph, I sent it to Bud Castor down here who was one of the best metallurgists that I've ever met, and he looked at it, he sent it to his buddies at Marshall, which he should have, and about two hours later I got a call from director of engineering down here and saying, what the “F” are you doing up there?  He’s saying, I just got a call from Marshall and you were there directing them to cut up, cut apart our hardware.  So he says you're gonna get some visitors tomorrow, so there was a whole team of Marshall folks come up then, and long story short, had we not found that problem we could have had pumps being built and the heads come off on the SRB and potentially lose the vehicle.  And about three months later I get a letter from Headquarters saying, hey, you know, you won a, you won an award, a Quasar award, which is an award given to, to non-quality guys who solve a serious quality problem…and it had a 10K check with it so I didn't mind that either.  But my point is when you are suspicious of something, take action; don't just think, ah, I won't worry about it, it’s somebody else's problem.  Tom Stafford: In fact this is what I get back to on this commercial, the contracts, I call them, this Commercial Crew.  In Apollo and Gemini, people like you could really make an input—bang!—that would stop it and you get to the problem and you fix it right then.  You direct the contractor, he salutes smartly; and that's not the way the Commercial Crew is set up.  Bernie Rosenbaum: It’s a big difference, yes.  Annette Hasbrook: So it's really interesting, you know, it focuses on the safety and risk leadership, so in closing I'd be interested in your thoughts, kind of what you think about how do we go forward and balance risk and knowing that the, space flight’s inherently dangerous, so just a couple comments from each of you.  Randy Bresnik: Well certainly if we learned anything from the Apollo and Gemini effort it's that they were singularly focused on the mission, that we had to get, you know, people to the moon and back safely by the end of the decade.  And, you know, think about what we're doing now, we need to take that same focus.  People can't be, you know, we've been so ensconced in our little rice bowls and our little projects and our little teams that we're working in and focus on those; we need to be thinking about what requirements we have on the books that maybe don't apply or need to be modified and updated, and challenge those old assumptions.  We also need to be able to, you know, look at risk by swimming outside our swim lanes, you know, get outside of your tunnel vision on your particular project, know what's going on to the left and right and think like the, the decision-makers ahead of you, so that all of us can be systems integrators rather than just the folks whose jobs are systems integration.  And then lastly, you know, I think we have to make smart risk decisions and, and not just take risk because we're going someplace new but the fact that we are living and breathing the mission every day and that we feel that sense of urgency and we're only taking the risk that we have to take, and so if you're not going home every day feeling like, boy, I put in a full effort to try and, you know, not leave anything on the table or decisions that need to be made or work that needs to be done, that's what we need that.  And, and when Apollo and Gemini, you know, program happened and we went to the moon, they didn't know that they could do it; we thought we could, but we didn't know that it could be done until we actually did it.  We know it can be done now, so that'll, should allow us to harness all this incredible, you know, innovation and experience that we have to be able to go ahead and make this effort happen in just the five short years that we've got to show that we can do it.  Annette Hasbrook: Well let's give a big round of applause to our panelists, really fantastic conversation today.  [Music]  Pat Ryan: Pretty interesting discussion there; thanks for hanging in.

                        "description": "Dan Huot (Host): Houston we have a podcast. Welcome to the official podcast of the NASA Johnson Space Center. This is Episode 93 Space Medicine. I'm Dan Huot and I'll be your host today. If you're new to the show, we bring in the experts here at NASA to talk about all the different parts of our space agency. Recently though I got a chance to get out of the studio and head up to Comicpalooza in Houston where we headed up a live recording of the podcast in front of a live audience of a couple hundred of our closest friends to discuss the science fiction and science fact of space medicine. Joining the esteemed panel was Gates McFadden, most famously known for her portrayal as Dr. Beverly Crusher, Chief Medical Officer aboard the USS Enterprise on the TV show Star Trek Next Generation. She shared her insight into how space medicine worked in the far off future of Star Trek and how she prepared for the role and assumed the character of a space doctor. And, joining her on the panel were some actual space doctors including Serena Auñón-Chancellor, a NASA astronaut and former flight surgeon who flew in space last year and also doctor's Kris Lehnhardt and Richard Jennings. We go into detail on who they are at the very beginning of this panel. This is the first time we've recorded a podcast from outside of our home here at NASA. And, this is the biggest live audience we've had yet. So, with no further delay, let's jump right ahead to another live recording of Houston We Have a Podcast, again, with Serena Aunon-Chancellor, Richard Jennings, Kris Lehnhardt and Gates McFadden, enjoy.  [ Music ]  Host: Well, we'll jump right in. Thanks everybody for being here. This is our panel on space medicine, all things space awesomeness and also our first live recording outside the Johnson Space Center for Houston We Have a Podcast. So, thanks for being here today. All right, if you're unfamiliar with us, we do podcasts on all things human space flight. We get to talk to some really incredible people, actors, scientists, astronaut, engineers, the people doing amazing things that inspire us and are really pushing, you know, humanity into the next generation. And so, today though, we're going to be focusing on space medicine. What happens to humans when you go into space? How do we keep you healthy? How do we prevent you from getting sick? How do we really keep you going when you're up there for extremely long periods of time? And, I'm going to go down the line real quick, introduce my esteemed panel, and then we will jump right in. I'm going to go to my notes because all of these people are insanely accomplished [laughter] and I want to make sure I don't leave anything out. So, starting off, right to my left we are joined today by Gates McFadden, everybody's going to recognize her.  [ Cheering ]  Gates McFadden: Thank you thank you.  Host: And, Gates obviously famous for her betrayal of Dr. Beverly Crusher, which I must say one of the coolest name in Sci Fi history [laughter], hands down. She was the Chief Medical Officer aboard the USS Enterprise D and E under the Command of Captain Jean-Luc Picard in the show Star Trek Next Generation. So, that show aired from 1987 to 1994. Gates though has directing choreography and puppeteering experience in film, films like Labyrinth and the Muppets Take Manhattan. And, was in a number of other pictures like the Hunt for Red October, personal favorite of mine, and When Nature Calls. And then, she's taught at several universities including the University of Southern California, Harvard, the American Academy of Dramatic Arts and the University of Pittsburgh. So again, let's hear it for Gates.  [ Applause ]  And then next to her, she's kind of easy to pick out. She's the astronaut amongst the group. This is Serena Aunon-Chancellor and she is a NASA astronaut and medical doctor. She's been on the International Space Station. She recently completed a long duration stage. She was flying above all of us for about six months while she was up there in orbit. She was there from June to December 2018. So, recently acclimated back here on earth. She's has a background though in internal medicine and she as a flight surgeon before she was an astronaut and conducted a whole bunch of experiments onboard the Space Station including once impacting diseases here on earth and doing some cancer research on the station. So, Serena, thanks for coming out today.  [ Applause ]  All right and then we have Kris Lehnhardt. And this is a mouthful. He is the Element Scientist for Exploration Medical Capability in NASA's Human Research Program.  Gates McFadden: That's like techno-babble.  Host: All right, and so, he also is at the Senior Faculty with Baylor College of Medicine and the Center for Space Medicine and Department of Emergency Medicine. He's board certified I emergency medicine not just here in the USA but also in Canada and he works clinically in the Emergency Department Ben Taub Hospital here in Houston. Some of his main research interests are in medical care an extreme environments, so places like space, people in the military, and out in the wilderness. And then, he's also a pilot because again, like I said, you guys can't just have one job, can you? You have to do like 40 different things. Also a pilot, he's a Reservist in the Royal Canadian Air Force and advanced open water scuba diver. So, let's hear it for Kris here with us.  [ Applause ]  And then, finally, down on the end, Richard Jennings whose a Clinical Professor in Space Medicine at UTMB and he's a Flight Surgeon for Space Adventures and he's a member of the Safety Advisory Panel to Space X, a couple of people might have heard of them, and a Medical Consultant to Virgin Galactic. And, he also served as a NASA flight surgeon, so something Serena's also done. So, he was there from 1987 to 1995 and continued to provide care until 2013. While he was at NASA he was the chief of the Flight Medicine Clinic and Chief Medical Operations for the Space Shuttle Program and he served as the director for the UTMB NASA JC Aerospace Medicine Program as well. And, as a Lead Flight Surgeon for Space Adventures, he's actually supported five missions on the Russian Soyuz Spacecraft over in Kazakhstan in Russia. That's a pretty interesting place. And, if you can corner him afterwards, ask him a bunch of questions, I guarantee you he's got some really cool stories about that. He was also a President of the Aerospace Medical Association and currently serves on the board of the Aerospace Medical Association Foundation. So, once again, let's hear it for Richard and for our entire panel for being here today.  [ Applause ]  Okay. And, that was the, that was the abridged version of everybody's biographies, just a really let it sink in. So, before we really get into the nitty gritty of space medicine and medical technology and stuff like that, I want to start off with something that's, it's really pertinent to a place like this, at Comipalooza, and that's inspiration. A lot of people, one of the great things, if you work at NASA or you know somebody that does, they're extremely passionate about what they do and the same is true for actors and artists, they're extremely passionate and they're always driven. So, I want to know, what kind of took each of you down that road? What was the guitar in the pawn shop window moment? And starting off with Gates, what really kind of drew you to be an actor, director, choreographer and, kind of, more importantly, what drew you to something like Start Trek?  Gates McFadden: Well, to be honest, I was pushed when I was young to be a performer. I always, personally, would play in the dirt pile making cities. I was like really into the relationship of people and space. Not necessarily the final frontier but just kind of the dirt pile frontier. But, as I got older and I was performing more and more and I was learning about theater and I majored in, at the university, I graduated from Brandeis University. And then, I met a man, I took a workshop at Harvard and he changed my life. So I would say he was the catalyst. He was someone who actually came to NASA. He was invited to NASA. And, he was unknown, pretty much, in the United States. But, he was very into analysis of movement. He had started in sports medicine and then he went into theater and he was friends with some of the most famous French artists of that period. But, he believed that artists had a responsibility to help change the world for the better. And, we actually studied things like architecture, we had to understand music and had to compose music. It was sort of like, really he synthesized a lot of ideas that I had had, because I liked more than one thing. I liked the whole process of creating something. And so, when I came back to the United States, I was much, all my friends had gone to New York to try to get an agent and make it. And, I was less thinking about my career but thinking about how could I effect change in the world or how could I be part of, participate in it? And so, I started doing, you know, literally started doing some street theater, doing different things. And then, I started getting teaching positions because I knew how to teach his techniques which were very much in demand. And so, I would say, that was the catalyst that got me thinking about the world. And, it was complete chance that Star Trek happened. I was not, really, I had done a lot of theater in New York City as an actor. I performed many, many, many plays and loved it because I loved transformation. So when Star Trek came up, I had actually already auditioned for a play I wanted to do with Linda Hunt and a director name Des McAnuff. So, believe it or not, this is real, I turned down Star Trek to go do this play for $400 a week. But you know what? I loved doing the play and I had no comprehension about the Star Trek Universe. I am so humbled now because I have learned more from the people I meet who have watched Star Trek. And yes, of course, I learned watching the show and I loved when my character would be involved in the Hippocratic oath working against the prime directive. I love that conflict. I thought that's really what we need to look at things like that, you know, the ethics of things, all sorts of things. And so, I think, that’s for me, that's really how I started to appreciate more and more how crucial Star Trek has been for so many people and for me. Because now, I feel such a bond in a community to people who really walk the walk, people like, I was telling them, Jim Wetherbee who commanded several Space Shuttle missions, became a friend. And, we emailed from the Space Station. I actually was like, you know, and I asked him. I said, why are you—you're doing it, I'm just pretending. And he said, “Yes, but you're the inspiration. And I like to think I have a lot of Jean-Luc Picard in me.” And, I went oh okay I get it, okay. So, I'm Dr. Crusher, I get it. And that kind of hope and inspiration, because our show was so positive. It wasn't dystopian. It had a really, you know, we can work together as a community. I think that has been so important in my life right now to be a role model to young people both as a single parent, in the show, and also as a medical commander. And so, anyway, it's a lot of talk, sorry I talked so long. But, that, for me, since I can't really walk the walk like they do, I'm honored to be part of this panel.  [ Applause ]  Host: Serena.  Serena Auñón-Chancellor: Yeah, absolutely also honored to be part of this panel. This is really fun for me because this is the first time I've ever been here. And, it was just neat walking around a little bit prior to coming up here. But, for me, I do remember probably at the age of eight or nine watching Shuttle missions launch over and over. And, for me, that is the memory that sticks in my mind as a catalyst. And my parents used to watch me do this. My father was an engineer, my mother was a novelist. And so, my father watched me, you know, staring for hours at the television watching anything I could about the Space Shuttle. And, he said, “Do you want to work for NASA?” And, I said, “I think so.” And he says “Well then, you need to be an engineer.” And so they just, it was sort of a matter of fact. There were no questions, not doubts. They just began to push me down that path. And then, I felt like very door that's opened since then has really led me here. Now, for me, I did major in electrical engineering, and this is out on the East Coast. But then, midway through my engineering career, I had a lot of friends who were also in the premed program. And, they kept coming to me saying Serena, we think you should be premed also. We think you should be a doctor we think you'd be really good at it. And, I really pushed them away at first because I thought of all the work that was entailed with that and all the memorization. And I said that's too much work I don't want to do that. And they said no Serena we really think you should do it. So, I went home over the summer and talked with my parents and they said fantastic we'll help you do that. And, I made that shift. And honestly, it was the best decision I have ever made because I am still a practicing physician. I absolutely love being a physician. It is my passion. And then, as I was training through medical school, I was still thinking how was I going to work for NASA? I didn't know how this was going to work. So, I just went on the internet and started looking up things and found this really great rotation at Johnson Space Center about aerospace medicine. It was a clerkship that was offered and I was just a few months away. So, I applied and came down and learned all about the facets of aerospace medicine, space medicine, the effects on the human body. And then really, I met this man, Dr. Richard Jennings, that you'll see down on the left. He has really been my great mentor throughout my entire career. But, he is the one that really introduced this field. And so, I applied to get into this special training program after medical school for both internal medicine and aerospace medicine. And, he was one of my program directors. So, Richard and I have know each other for a very long time and he's really meant quite a great deal for me in this path. Once I finished training, I became a flight surgeon and began looking after astronauts and their families and spent most of my time in Russia. So, I got a little bit of a taste of what it was like and then applied for the Astronaut Corps in 2009 and was honored to get in. It was a long journey to my first flight, almost ten years, actually since coming in the corps and finally flying. And after landing almost four months ago after 197 days, people ask what it was like and it's almost hard to describe unless you're up there. Just the beauty of the earth, but really, more importantly, the science that we did. I was highly impressed at the caliber of science now that impacts everyone down here including every person in this room. So, it's great to be back, number one, because I get to be here with my family, do events like this, and smell the earth again.  [ Applause ]  Host: All right, Kris.  Kris Lehnhardt: It's going to sound a little corny, but, my path to being here started with Star Trek. I remember being a little kid, lying on the floor in front of the TV watching reruns of the original series with my mom. And, I was a little kid in Canada and, if my accent had not already given me away as a Canadian, I really loved the idea of doing something in the space sector. But, Canada's a pretty small country and we have a space program, but it's a pretty small space program. And, I thought I wanted to be a vet. I liked animals and I wanted to take care of animals. And, I met with a high school guidance counselor who said to me, “Don't you really like space?” And I said “Yes.” And, he said, “Well, how are you going to do space stuff if you're a vet?” Well, NASA has actually selected veterinarians previously to be in the Astronaut Corps. But, not for a long time. And so, I just switched species. [laughter] I became a medical doctor and I did that because there was a Canadian astronaut by the name of Dave Williams. He was an emergency physician. And, I thought, that sounds like a cool job. Maybe if I do that, I can be an astronaut. Well, I'm sitting beside an astronaut, so, that's pretty good. But now, I get to help design medical systems for space exploration. And so, if you can't be there then being part of the mission is the next best thing. And, it's been a real honor to do this job and to be up here on this panel.  Gates McFadden: Incredible.  [ Applause ]  Richard Jennings: I'm not sure why, if you have two susceptible individuals and they both get exposed to an infectious agent why one gets it and one doesn't get it. But, in 1955, I saw the movie Conquest of Space and then in 58 we had Explorer 1 images on our bulletin board in class. And, I got extremely interested in space and I followed every launch, every scrub getting up at 3 in the morning listening to Shorty Powers from Mercury Control talking about that. And then, later on, there was a TV series. And, there's a real power, I think, with television and movies that effect people. And, I saw Men Into Space which starred William Lundigan. Chuck Berry from NASA was a consultant on that show actually. And then, eventually, I decided I wanted to be Bill Douglas or Chuck Berry. They became people that I wanted to be. I wanted to be taking care of the doctor—be a doctor taking care of the astronauts in the Space Program. And, in college, instead of writing on the Beowulf and it’s imagery or whatever, I got to write about the medical aspects of the Space Program and I've been doing it now for the last 50 something years.  Host: All right.  [ Applause ]  Host: All right, we're going to jump right in. We are going to take questions at the end, in the last 15 minutes or so, so start thinking now. But, let's jump into kind of what we're doing in this day and age. So, Serena, you were a flight surgeon, you were an astronaut. What does the medical picture look like? How are we preparing people to go to space right now and how are we maintaining them while they're up there and once they come back?  Serena Auñón-Chancellor: Yeah so, that's actually pretty complicated. Most, there's not, so, the preparation to go into space, most of that involves training of Space Station systems and, you know, we of course stay health and get as much exercise as we can. But, once you're in space, you're in space, you're in microgravity and we can't stop microgravity. It's going to effect the body and does it in multiple ways. For me, the first few days, you just don't feel that good. Your stomach doesn't feel that good, your head feels a little big, you have this massive fluid shift that's occurred. So, you feel really stuffy and full. And, of course, you're floating everywhere. So, you're desperately trying to grab onto hand rails with your hands because you haven't learned to use your feet yet and you haven't learned to really move like a monkey. And that's, we got really good at that towards the end of the mission. And, of course, immediately the things that are occurring that you don't feel, your bones, you muscles. You're no longer loaded by gravity. And so, those start to, in essence, break down almost immediately. You don't feel it. But, after six months, if you don't do anything to counter it, you'll know. And so, we actively try and keep our bodies as healthy as we can. For example, we lift weights every day onboard the Space Station. And, people say well how do you do that? Well, we have a special device that creates a load using vacuum tubes. And, we're able to do squats or bench press and all kinds of exercises. We run on a treadmill where we're wearing a special harness that loads us down. We don't get our full body weight but we kind of gradually move up. So, we've gotten to be pretty good at countering a lot of these changes. Now again, that's really for only about six months in low earth orbit. So, the game really does change as we move on towards Mars, have a service day and come back. And we're still working on many, many ways trying to keep ourselves healthy all the way there and back. Because now, you've got other things that kick in like space radiation, extended stays away from family. You can't see the earth anymore. There's so many aspects to preparing the human for exploration missions. It'll boggle your mind. But, that's really what we all work on most of the time.  Gates McFadden: That's amazing.  Host: And, we've gotten here after, you know, 50 years of exploring. Richard, kind of take us through the Genesis of all that. When we were starting to launch people into space, we didn't know what the heck was going to happen when they started floating around. I mean there were wild theories about some stuff. What were those kind of early days like?  Richard Jennings: This July the 16th will be the 50th anniversary of the launch of Apollo 11. And, I'd like to get back to Apollo 11. But, what is really remarkable about the Apollo program and Apollo 11 is that a very young president—a very young president, after a 15 minute suborbital flight said that we should send a man to the moon and bring him back safely and do it in this decade. I don't think he pronounced it decade. But, nevertheless. So, you can't look at Apollo 11, I don't think, without considering the flow that occurs through Mercury, Gemini, and then Apollo. And, a lot of people aren't aware that there was a huge controversy with regard to Mercury. Mercury was where were going to send our first astronauts into space. Allen Shepherd was the first one, John Glenn was the first to orbit. But, there was a roaring controversy where a lot of the scientists I the country did not think we should do it that we would kill them. And, in fact, a Wiesner Report was filed on January, early January given to Kennedy that we shouldn't do it, we should be doing animals, doing robotics and those sort of things. And, because of that, one we protected ourselves a little bit by taking astronauts who had to go through a five phase selection cycle they were extremely fit, extremely health, and shorter. They couldn't be over, 5 foot 11 was the highest they could be and they were all in their 30s. And, sometimes we give up our youth and our health to get the money like to day the spots that people are doing now for $40 million. But, they were very healthy. And so, because of this report and other problems, at the end of January, the last day of January we launched Ham, a chimpanzee on a flight, which was, a lot of people don't talk about it. But, it was sort of a semi-disaster. He ended up experiencing 15 G's and he also almost, the capsule almost sunk before they could get it out of the water, took in 900 pounds of water. But, that gave people some confidence we could launch Allen Shepherd. And, we previously launched a squirrel monkey and a rhesus monkey Mable and Ms. Baker earlier. So, we had some pretty good confidence. The Russians had launched Belka and Strelka. But, they had a big meeting in March and they said okay let's go do it. Unfortunately, what happened on April the 12th of 1961, we weren't the first. Yuri Gagarin orbited one time then. So, finally, whenever Allen Shepherd flew, it was May the 5th, we had delayed long enough that he wasn't the first into space. But, the whole idea of the Mercury Program was could humans survive and would they be an effective crew member inside the vehicle? And they were. They did very well. The flights were limited, the first two were suborbital, two five hour flights and then a sixth rev flight and then a 34 hour 22 rev flight, very limited. The only medical thing that came out of that, we only did pre and post flight physicals, not much during the mission, was that they had a little tendency, when they stood up to get light headed and have a fast heart rate.  After Mercury, Gemini came along and that's the one that, both from a technical and a medical standpoint, led to Apollo 11. Two thousand man hours of time were accumulated in space. They had, because we were going to do lunar rendezvous for our landing on the moon, we had to learn how to rendezvous and dock. And, we also had to learn how to do EVA. And so, that was critical and it was done in Gemini. But, from a medical side, most of our lunar missions were going to be 12, the longness was going to be 12 days. So, they needed a little margin there. And so, they started making the flights longer. And, Gemini 4 was 4 days and to be cautious, they just doubled it. Gemini 5 was 8 days and then Gemini 7 was 14 days. And, during those missions they did this in counter measures and other things. But generally they were doing pre and post flights except for those kind of flights. It was a huge success. The program was a huge success. We did find that people do have a little bit of loss in blood volume, they lost some weight. EVA had a real high load, really, work load was much higher than anticipated. They had cardiovascular de-conditioning. And, the orthostasis, passing out when you stand up, got a little bit worse. But, overall, the feeling was, we could go to the moon. And, we didn't have to do a whole lot of testing during the Apollo program. Some of the things we learned early in the Apollo program was the Russians had had motion sickness when they launched. In fact, their second flight, with Titov they had motion sickness and we got into that on Apollo 8 and Apollo 9 because we had a bigger vehicle and they were moving around. We also learned the value of the Health Stabilization program, quarantine before the flight because we had sickness on Apollo 8, sickness and a delay of the mission on Apollo 9. And, Apollo 13, you're all familiar with the measles exposure. And so, after that, they came up with the Health Stabilization program. But, Apollo 11, when we got to Apollo 11, they felt pretty comfortable at that point. Apollo 10 had been a real similar mission. Just from a medical standpoint, they did not have a lot of things on board, for example, no dental equipment, none whatsoever and just a few medicines because they were so concerned about weight. To give you an example, when Armstrong and Aldrin landed on the moon, they had six Band Aids I their kit. They did have 12. But, they took out six Band Aids because they were too heavy.  Gates McFadden: Oh my God.  Richard Jennings: And, they were really trying to make the kits, you know, lighter and lighter. And so, there's some really big constraints on what you could take. And, each of the astronauts had to test those drugs so we wouldn't have an untoward, you know, an untoward reaction to them. When we did the mission, this one went fine, probably less medicines used on Apollo 11 than any other flight. They did use some aspirin. It's interesting, Mike Collins had had knee problems and pain in his knee on Gemini 10 and he had it again on Apollo 11, he never told anybody about that until he wrote his book later on because they usually don't want to tell the doctors that something that might cause problems with a future flight or something. But, he did have that. When they decided to get into the lunar module and land on the moon, they did take medicine to make the GI system slowdown called lowmodel. They did that, they used two of those. And then, when they got ready to land, they used scopolamine dexatrimine. Because a spacecraft like a capsule, and we're finding this out, you know, now with the capsule we're using landing on water, they're great in space but they're really bad in boats. And, when you land in the water and the moving around, people really get sick. But, they did not use too many and they had a really great flight. One thing that people forget though is we were worried, after Apollo 11, about back contamination, in other words, them, not us bringing something to the moon but something on the moon that was deleterious to humans. So, when they came back before they got out of the capsule, they put on these biological oscillation garments that they wore then they went into a mobile quarantine facility, which is kind of like a air stream trailer. And, that trailer was brought to Houston and put in the lunar receiving lab which is also in isolation and all the spacecraft and the moon, the materials were put into that. And, they had to stay I that for 21 days from the time they launched from the surface. But, overall Apollo 11 was a great mission built on a lot of work from really hundreds of thousands of people. And, based on Mercury, Gemini, then Apollo.  Gates McFadden: Can I ask a question? A couple. I wanted to know if an astronaut has had some surgery that they have any piece of a metal screw or anything inside, are they, would they be prohibited from doing a mission? Or, the second part of that is what has been the most serious illness that has required some sort of intervention that has happened?  Richard Jennings: You're talking about in space.  Gates McFadden: Yeah.  Richard Jennings: We had, the United States hasn't really had much.  Gates McFadden: Okay.  Richard Jennings: We've been lucky. There's a reason, it's not lucky, truthfully, it is somewhat. Things can happen to people. But, for the most part, like, to give an example, let's go back to the Apollo. They have a selection physical which is unbelievable. They have annual physicals. Then, for Apollo, they have physicals, fairly extensive, L minus 30 or F minus 30 they called it back then, 30 days before the mission, 15 days before the mission, 5 days before the mission, and they're really looking at things. Like, we don't carry dental equipment. But, they don't allow any dental restorations for example.  Gates McFadden: They don't okay.  Richard Jennings: And, three months before the flight, because new restorations are the ones most likely to cause problems. We have not had any. We, back to the Apollo program, on Apollo 15 one of the crew members had cardiac dysrhythmia.  Gates McFadden: Okay.  Richard Jennings: And, they thought it was due to potassium and it may have been. But, it turns out, this particular person had extensive coronary artery disease. This was before you could do calcium studies or—  Gates McFadden: Okay.  Richard Jennings: CT angiograms of coronary vessels. And he had extensive disease and, within two years of the flight he had a cardiac arrest due to a heart attack. The Russians have had some. They've had kidney stones, they've had some things happen. But, in general, we've been extremely lucky.  Gates McFadden: And what do they, like with the kidney stone, what happened, what did they do?  Richard Jennings: Well, you, for men you give them something to make their prostate smaller. You might hydrate them a little, use pain medication.  Gates McFadden: Pain medication.  Richard Jennings: Then you wait.  Gates McFadden: Yeah, yeah, but no one's performed any real surgery.  Richard Jennings: Well, we do on animals some using a glove box. And, it's been practiced in zero gravity and zero gravity airplanes. We've done laparoscopy, we've done cystoscopy, laparotomy, we've done all the things we can do but you did it in 22 second increments not in space.  Gates McFadden: Interesting.  Richard Jennings: Yeah.  Gates McFadden: Thank you.  Host: And so, Gates, kind of, we heard a little bit about what the very beginning of space medicine was like. In your world, that you played in.  Gates McFadden: Yeah Dr. Crusher was much more advanced.  [Laughter]  Host: She was much more advanced.  Gates McFadden: I had quite a few degrees and yeah, right.  Host: Building on the legacy of people like Richard Jennings. But, what are some of the really kind of fantastical technologies that stood out for you that you got to interact with?  Gates McFadden: Well, I loved when, you know, we were replacing spines. And, first of all, the triquarter is just such an amazing machine. And, people have developed the triquarter now, it's not out there, but Xprize actually had from all over the word, teams develop a triquarter. I mean, how fantastic is that? Because to be able to diagnose quickly and to be able to take the readings of everyone's you know what's going on in their body, you would know if someone had the heart arythmic thing. And so, I think there were so many fantastic things that that we were able to do in theoretical, you know, on the spaceship. One of the things that I really found I think about this quite a lot actually, is we had, so we had Data, all right. And he was android, so he's the machine creature. But now, I know that, even in medicine, we put parts of the brain in that can make someone who's had an arm amputated, it can make it so that they can function with a, you know, a new arm that's there, a bionic arm. And, I think about things like privacy and how do you, what happens when..? We haven't really done anything, I don't know, I haven't done it but, in, with the brain where there's some sort of technology where they're trying to deal with something like depression without, and I'm not talking schedules, but literally, you know, you have your own private thoughts. A computer doesn't have their own private thoughts. And pretty soon, you know, it's like what happens when the blend, do we ever get to that point? And, what are the ethical questions about that? And, I'm fascinated by that. I don't know if I'm totally speaking, you know, asking something stupid, but, I'm interested.  Host: Well, I mean, Kris I know you're involved in some of those kind of futuristic technologies. Things like a triquarter might be around the corner in space. I mean, what are some of the things that you’ve seen that you're working on that kind of get you really excited for the next couple decades?  Kris Lehnhardt: It's very fascinating working in NASA and looking at the way that we care for people in space because you would think that we have the newest and greatest technology in space to take care of people. But, what we actually have are things that are very well tested, tried and true things. And, we haven't really been pushing the boundaries of what space medicine or space technology could look like in the future. And, that's because we've been working right now, for the last 20 years on the International Space Station. And, the goal, in terms of medical care for the Space Station is send up extremely healthy people, send up medicine and equipment you could use to manage things, day to day kind of things like aches and pains. But, if you have an emergency, a true emergency, then, there's enough equipment up there to stabilize someone, and then, the plan is to get them home as quickly as you can. And, thankfully, we have not had to do that because, as has been said, we send really healthy people to space. Now, in the future, we're not going to be able to evacuate people, if you are three months on the way to Mars and something bad happens, you are not coming home again. So, what we're working on now, in the future are developing systems that try to allow us provide more capability in space. So, testing out ultrasound machines that are basically the size of my fist and plug into a phone and developing x-ray technology that's extremely small and portable and can be used in space. Or even developing new computer technologies so we can transfer data around and move information better. Right now, we don't store medical data on the Space Station, we send it all to the ground because it's super easy to do that. But, when you have a communication delay, you're going to Mars and it takes 20 minutes for information to move back and forth, sending every little piece of information back and forth is just not efficient. So, how do we manage that on the spacecraft? And then, hopefully, when someone does get sick on the way to Mars, you're going to have a doctor with them who's going to access all that information and all those new technologies and they're going to be able to use those to take care of people in space. And so, that's the ultimate goal.  Gates McFadden: Do you work with cryonics at all, I mean do you work with the idea of getting people like, theoretically, if you're sick and you can't really treat it but you can take their temperature down. Is that something that you all even talk about?  Kris Lehnhardt: So, there is actually a NASA project that is looking at advanced concepts. And, one of the concepts that they're looking at is something like that, they call it TORPOR. And, basically it's the idea of, can I slow down someone's metabolism and essentially preserve them for longer because we've done that? And so, those are concepts that we still look at and we're very interested in, in the future. But, we can't even do that on the ground very well right now. So, NASA doesn't like to fly things into space that we haven't tested ad nauseum on the ground. And so, that one's still many years away.  Gates McFadden: Thank you.  Host: And so, one of my favorite things about Star Trek and a lot of science fiction is actually the myriad of alien disease and things like that we end up running out to on the final frontier. Because, I mean, right now NASA, we're mostly worried about people bringing stuff from Earth, with them, you know? That's why we do the quarantine and stuff, things like that. Gates, what are some of the really memorable, you know, viruses or plagues that you guys had to combat that, you know, really stand out in your mind.  Gates McFadden: Well, of course there was the Naked Now, that makes you just kind of nicely drunk, I guess, that one was always very fun. But, its, and also what that actually brings up is, so if everyone has, is affected by this virus, how does the medical team, in spite of the effects of this virus, figure out, with the computer, what's going on and how to solve it, and how to diagnose it, and then how to treat it? I mean, there were a lot of things like that. And, then, of course, there were invasive things that would take over your mind, and do all that. That's why I think it's fascinating, the psychological aspect of all of it, and how do you deal? I always have admired the astronauts, because, obviously, they're going to be top notch people who are driven, who know how to do their program. And, it's like the people who fly those fighter jets, you know exactly what you're supposed to do so you're not in terror. You're like, I do this, then I do this, then I have to check this, and I work out now, and I do this. And that's fantastic. But, just to be aware of, psychologically, all the things that you, that could be happening. When you said, when you can't see Earth anymore, that was fascinating. Can you talk more about that? Because, to me, that's the reason, I personally want to go into space, is so that I can actually look at Earth and get a new perspective. But once that's not there, what's that like? How do you deal with that?  Serena Auñón-Chancellor: Yeah, so I think, looking at, kind of psychological or behavioral issues that we're going to have to deal with on a long exploration class mission, are huge. I think they've been on the bottom of everybody's priority list, because they're very touchy feely, and hard to discuss, and you don't have distinct treatments for some of these things, but what do you do as Earth becomes smaller, and smaller, and smaller? What do you do when you want to talk to your family, and the time delay gets to the point where you're left with only recorded messages that you send back and forth? You know, for us, in the station, we can see the Earth all the time. We fly over continents very quickly. I can call my husband on his cell phone, pretty much, at any time that I wanted. I had that communication. So, to me, that was very important. I still felt connected to Earth. I had the internet. You know, I could look at the news online. That was important. So, how do we deal with that as we move further and further away? And there are a lot of people looking at these things. But, perhaps we have to go back, kind of, to the old explorers. And I will say that, even during our mission, there was a Soyuz that was supposed to make it up there with two more of our crew mates, and that ship did not make it. It aborted. The crew was safe, because the launch abort system worked perfectly, and saved their lives. But all of the sudden, it was just 3 of us.  Gates McFadden: Right.  Serena Auñón-Chancellor: And we though, oh dear, things have changed. Still plenty of work to do, but the entire dynamic changes up there. And, so, we had just watched a movie talking about Ernest Shackleton, and his time with his crew, and how they were stranded for certain parts. And, so, the commander, at the time, of, on board the space station was Alex Gerst, from Germany, and so we decided to do some of those things. We threw a Halloween party. It was just the 3 of us, but you know what, we had a small party, we had costumes, everything.  Gates McFadden: Well, it's creative.   Serena Auñón-Chancellor: Absolutely.  Gates McFadden: And I think, see, I think that's the part, and if I can?  Serena Auñón-Chancellor: Yes.  Gates McFadden: Like, again, it's with Star Trek, because to be creative, you're using parts of your brain, and you are imagining things. And just to engage the imagination, so that it's not only scientific. I mean, obviously, you have to be imagining in order to be scientific. You wouldn't even come up with the idea that you want to prove. But, I think, sometimes it's getting away from it, totally, being out of your comfort zone, that you really can discover something about yourself. And discovering something about myself makes me much more engaged in the world. Like, oh, I didn't realize I would be like that if I were doing this, or whatever. You learn about yourself. You're interested in yourself, and less worried about being interesting. You're interested, you know, in—  Serena Auñón-Chancellor: Yeah, and I think, one of the things we also did, just because the station is a very sterile environment, right? There are no smells of earth, there's no wind, there's no rain, you had the same people that you're with. And, so, the one way we could make station more human on the inside was music. And I didn't realize how important music, I mean, I listened to music down here, in my car, or wherever, but up there, we had music all the time. And depending on which module you were in, you could be listening to Queen or to Mozart, it just depended on who was working in that module at that time. But that, for me, made the Space Station so much more human, and it just felt like we belonged there, and this was ours.  Host: Well, so, so far we've only had to really worry about a limited number of people in space at any given time. Like, you only have 6 people, typically, 7 sometimes, on board the space station. In the future, we're going to be in situations like Dr. Crusher was, where you have entire star ships worth of people, and entire colonies worth of people, especially as we have commercial companies starting to fly people into space. What do you guys see, kind of, over the horizon, and even, kind of, longer term in the world of space medicine?  Richard Jennings: Well, I'm really excited about commercial space flight, and the commercial crew program. I know how to count seats, and there's a few more seats in those vehicles than just for the astronauts. And, so, we'll be flying some other people. And there'll eventually be free flyers in low Earth orbit, and colonization of Mars. Hopefully we'll become a multiplanetary species. I'm excited about it. Up until now, all the people have been selected, pretty much, by agencies, bureaucracies, that sort of thing. And commercial space flight can be much more agile. Finally, it'll have some nontraditional people flying up. We've had 8 that flew to the International Space Station through Space Adventures. And you have computer experts, you have artists, all different kinds of people, and that's great. We need different people flying in space. One of the other things is that, back to going to the long duration flights, we're going to have to learn how to take care of medical conditions that do develop, like Gates was talking about. We don't have much experience in that. Well, where can we get it? Commercial space flight. Just like I said, you give up your youth and your health to be able to afford one of those flights, and it's a little bit self-serving, for me, because I always have to get these guys approved to fly, but we ought to require that they have something wrong with them. Where else can we learn, unless we do that? And, so, I'm very excited. I'm excited that the numbers are going to increase, that we'll have nontraditional crew members flying. I think the biggest issue will not be medical. It gets back to what you were just discussing, is the psychological aspect. And that's why, I do think, a nice 6 month training program is a good deal. And if there are going to be problems, they'll tend to come out. Most anybody can be on their best behavior for a couple of weeks, but if you put them in a stressful situations, teamwork, over 6 months, if there's a problem, you're going to find out about it. But I'm terribly excited about commercial space flight.  Gates McFadden: One of the, I went to Gene Roddenberry, my first year, I said, can I base a lot of my character on Dr. Oliver Sacks, who was this amazing neurologist. I had read all of his books up to, and he, you know, even now that he's passed, he still has books that'll come out. The most amazing things, because it's all about neurology in the brain, and it's such a burgeoning field, right now, as is radiology, which is enormous. But, it's fascinating, just on earth, all the things the brain does. And when we go up in space, and all that we don't know, and when it changes your entire perspective of the, of the universe, right? Your, my perspective would be completely changed. I'm not looking up like that, I'm looking around, and I'm either seeing nothing, or seeing the Earth small. That has to be profound. That certainly is something that would drive me, should I have the money, ever, to go up into space. I think that would be amazing.  Host: Well, Gates, I'm happy to pool my money with yours, and we can go together.  Gates McFadden: Alright!  Host: We did get—we're going to have to end a little early, so I want to start questions now, if you guys have questions. We have a mic, here, in the center, so if you want, go ahead and line up, and we can start taking some questions for our panel. And if you know who the question is to, just go ahead and ask them.  Audience Member: Well, the first question I have is, are there any plans on cross training? Because right now, I see it as there's just one doctor on the station at a time. What happens if the doctor gets sick?  Host: Good question.  Serena Auñón-Chancellor: So, actually, all of the astronauts that fly to the station are trained to, about, the level of a basic EMT. They get training in hospital settings, in ER's, they learn how to suture, they learn how to put in Foley catheters, they are familiar with almost, pretty much every piece of equipment that we have up there. And, in fact, we do joint training's as a crew for, what we call, bad events. We do have a defibrillator up there, as well. And, so, our folks are pretty well trained when they get up there. That being said, you're right, we don't have a doctor with every crew. I wish we did. That would be more flight opportunities for all of us docs out there. But, we rely on the training of the crew, and then the flight surgeons on the ground, who are looking out after us. Now, that's a benefit we have, only being in low Earth orbit, in that we can talk to the docs real time, we can show them live video, they can help us walk through and talk us through anything that might happen. But, yeah, cross training is definitely something we do.  Audience Member: Okay. My daughter is 13 years old. Your show is her favorite show. And you're the one who made her want to be an astronaut. So, my question is, for a 13 year old girl going to high school, and everything, from a small town, what advice would you have for her going forward on a career path line?  Gates McFadden: Is she talking to me?  Serena Auñón-Chancellor: Both of us I think.  Gates McFadden: Me, both, or which one?  Audience Member: All of you.  Gates McFadden: No, you go ahead.  Serena Auñón-Chancellor: What, so my big thing that I would say, because I think this tends to happen with young girls, especially when they're in their early teens is they see something that they're really interested in, but they're afraid to ask about it. Or they see somebody that works and does a really cool job, and they think, that person doesn't have time for me. They're not going to have time to answer my questions. And, so, I really encourage kids to bother, meaning go up and talk to that person, find out what they do, ask if you can spend time with them. And, also, remind them it's okay to change their mind. So, I started off, in my college career, as an engineer, and initially I was just going to continue on with engineering, until friends and outside forces pushed me towards medicine. And, so, I was a little afraid, thinking, wow, can I change my mind right in the middle of college? And it's totally okay to do. It's okay, because you're going to find out what you’re passionate about, and that it's all going to work out just fine. So, give her, though, for me, those two pieces of advice, I'd say, she's going to find something that she's passionate about, and whatever it is, just to stick with it.  Gates McFadden: I will say that I meet, every time I do a convention, I meet so many extraordinary, young women. I mean, really, the kids that come up to the table who are interested and know the show, they are sensational. I am a person who happens to believe that if these children grow up, and they become the people who are, you know, taking care of me in the old age, we're going to be fine. Because they are interested in all sort of things, and I do feel that there's too much pressure, I think, dealing with anxiety and having to do everything. That's the one thing I noticed, more from being a teacher for 35 years on the university level. There's way too much pressure on kids to know what they want to do so young. I mean, if you peak when you're, you know, 7, what are you going to do for the rest of your life? So, I think that, I would advise not to push, expose children to a lot of different things, and see what they are drawn to. And then, if they're drawn to it, then okay, then you can, sort of, guide a little bit more. But I feel having to make decisions of what they're going to do, in their preschool years, is, it's ridiculous. Because I have, some of the best people I've ever taught didn't know what they were doing, and then they suddenly got passionate, and wow. It's because they wanted it. You know? So, I think it's both. It's listening to advice, people say hey, you're really good at this, listening to advice, and speaking up and asking questions. But I think it's also, sometimes, for the parents to just, parents, just love them, you know, just love them. Yeah, great. Great.  Audience Member: All right. So, at the early start of NASA, there was talk about having a limited amount of weight you could have on the flight up. With having the Space Station and everything else, and well you mentioning how important music is, are people, are astronauts able to bring up, now, instruments, or some other personal items to be able to play in space, and just, kind of, let off steam?  Serena Auñón-Chancellor: Yeah. I mean, we've had several instruments. We have keyboards, we have two guitars, we have a saxophone up there, right now. We had a pan flute, and 3 recorders on my most, on my last, on my mission here. So it was amazing, one of our cosmonauts seemed to pull every musical instrument out of his crew quarters.  Gates McFadden: Fantastic.  Serena Auñón-Chancellor: I didn't think it was even possible that he had any more in there, but he did. [laughter] And we would gather, often on Friday and Saturday evenings. Because two of our guys could play guitar, and everybody liked to sing. And we tried to play the recorder, it was awful. [laughter] But it didn't matter. It was something we could do together, as an international crew.  Richard Jennings: On thing I'd mention is that, we're kind of at a changing point, though, with some of the large items on the International Space Station. Our counter measures that we have, the medical counter measures, work great. The resistive exercise device, the treadmills, the bicycle odometers, these sort of things, they work really well, but they're just too big to go to Mars with. So, one of the things we're having to look at, not only the counter measure things, but the enjoyment things that you're talking about, they're going to be much more limited for exploration class type missions. And, so, we're, there's a lot of work going on in that area right now, to get things a little smaller, and what do we really need to support exploration class missions?  Kris Lehnhardt: So, maybe, no guitar, but a ukulele, I guess?  Serena Auñón-Chancellor: Yeah.  [ Laughter ]  Gates McFadden: They need a holodeck, I think, but that's a ways off. That's how we used to blow off steam, right?  Audience Member: My question involves nutrition, and I know that nutrition is something that's almost in the medical field. But, as important as music is, also good eating is important. So, I was wondering if these long missions to Mars, if the people would have any culinary excitement that they could take with them.  Kris Lehnhardt: We are studying that, right now, at NASA. And I can tell you, it's—food is a real problem for Mars. So, how do you make nutritious food that doesn't spoil, that lasts for more than 3 years. It's really difficult. The other point you brought up, though, is interesting food. And, I'm sure we could make a very unpalatable bar that everyone could eat, every day, all the time.  Serena Auñón-Chancellor: I've eaten them.  Kris Lehnhardt: Yes. And it's, you don't realize the power of food, I think, until you don't have the variety. And, Serena, I think, can certainly talk about this. When fresh, fresh fruit arrives on a spacecraft, it's pretty magical. We're trying to grow vegetables in space, right now. And, so there's lettuce that we've grown on board, and we're working on other vegetables, as well. But, in the end, we're going to have to do a significant amount of research to find out how we can make the food last, keep it interesting, so we keep the crew healthy. An uninterested crew is not a good crew, psychologically, and they're going to, then, have trouble achieving their mission, and that's our primary objective. So, in the end, nutrition is going to play a more and more important role in space flight, both psychologically and physically.  Audience Member: So, hi. My name's Natalie, and my question was for the people that are medical doctors. So, what do you do when you didn't want to study at all? Personally, right now, I'm still in my premed years. I haven't taken the MCAT yet, and I'm taking organic chemistry soon. So.  Serena Auñón-Chancellor: Sorry.  Audience Member: Yeah. To be honest, I should be studying right now, instead of being here.  [ Laughter ]  Serena Auñón-Chancellor: Yeah, so you know, you're going to have those times. Don't get me wrong, I didn't fly through medical school loving every day, and thinking that every class was fantastic, and certainly not organic chemistry. And, so, but what was important to me were the creative things I'd do on the side. What hobbies do you have? I engaged in sports a lot, and martial arts a lot. So, you always have to have things that, kind of, engage the other side of your brain, to give yourself a break. We do the same thing on space station. We work very long hours during the week, and then most of the time we have weekends off to go do things to give ourselves a break. A lot of times, it's photography, it's looking out the window, it's talking to our families and friends. Because when you start to feel that burn out, that stress, what that tells me is you need to take a step back. Because it's not that you don't like what you're doing anymore, but you need to make sure and engage in other things that really let yourself decompress and let your batteries recharge.  Gates McFadden: I mean, I think there's even, I'm not speaking, now, for any astronaut thing, but I have a son who's a violinist, and he, I mean, when, at certain points it was like, you have 100 pages of music you have to learn. And, I mean, it's 9 hours of practice. And he, for years, he almost over practiced. And as he's gotten older, and better and better, he's learned that it's better to just take a step back, do something totally different, even if it's a type 20 minutes, and then you go back to it, and you actually plan how, you get more organized. That he actually is now, spends more time just creating, this is what I have to do in order to get to that concert. And he always plans in the breaks, and when he's, you know, and he actually condenses, now, his practice time, and he sounds better, which is really fabulous. I wish I had known that.  Host: All right. I think we have time for one or two more.  Audience Member: Hi. I've been reading some of the research that's come out from the study of the Kelly Twins, and the mutations from the extended period in space. How are we going to deal with that on the extended time you'd have in space on a mission to Mars?  Gates McFadden: Yeah, it's tough.  Kris Lehnhardt: Thanks for that hard question.  Gates McFadden: Yeah.  [ Laughter ]  Kris Lehnhardt: It's a, it is a real challenge, and I think that one of the things that the Twins Study showed us is that people do come back from space different than they went. And one of the things that we talk about a lot in space medicine is that there's many, many things that happen to us in space that are, we think that they're bad, but they're actually just adaptive processes. And we're getting used to a new environments, and humans are extremely adaptable in that respect. There are other things about the space environment, though, that have a significant negative impact on us, and radiation is one of those. The way that we're going to deal with radiation, right now on the International Space Station, you're still very close to the Earth, and the Earth actually provides you with protection from the radiation of deep space. And, so now, as we push out to the Moon, and on to Mars, we're going to have to deal with that deep space radiation environment. And the way that we're going to do that is through newer, and better technologies. We're going to have to be able to shield spacecraft, as well as possible, to try and prevent the radiation from getting in. But, then, we also know that there's radiation that will pass through any shielding that we have, and that's, in that respect, we have to be able to, then, provide counter measures to the astronauts so that they don't get sick. And those are going to be nutrition based, they may be medicines, as well, exercise may play a role in that. There's many different ways that we might be able to prevent some of those changes. But, at the end of the day, everyone who goes to space comes back different. And we have to accept that, and there is a certain level of risk associated with that. And if the mission is important enough, then the risk is worth it.  Host: All right. We can do one more question.  Audience Member: I married up, didn't I? Gates, I can't think of a single character anywhere in the Star Trek universe with a higher sense of personal integrity than Doctor Beverly Crusher, so I thank you for that portrayal.  Gates McFadden: Thank you, very much.  [ Applause ]  Audience Member: Doctor Auñón-Chancellor, if you could snap your fingers, and live to see your greatest dream, your greatest space exploration dream, living, working in space, what would that be?  Serena Auñón-Chancellor: If I could snap my finger, right now, I'd say what I'd love to see would be colonies on Mars, fully functioning, producing our own food, small cities, towns being built, schools being built, and a huge, diverse group of people, with maybe some of the first children being born on Mars, as well. And it may not be as far off as you think, but certainly along with that, I can't see us sticking with current means of rocket technology, and it taking us that long to get there. And those ideas are also being developed. Ion propulsion, how fast, can the trip be much shorter, can you go visit your aunt on Mars? Could that be possible? Absolutely. And push on past Mars. What other planetary services, or bodies, could we land on? So, if I were to think about that, right now, you know, protection of the human really is at the forefront of my mind. Can we keep the humans safe from radiation, and everything else that we've talked about here today? And, at first, all of these problems seem impossible, but every time we seem to overcome them. I mean, people ask me, wasn't it fantastic looking out at the earth? How did your perspective change? And I'd say, sure the earth is beautiful, no question, but what really got me excited, where I really had to stop and say wow, was watching all these vehicles, cargo vehicles pull up, like it was every day business. They'd come out and say, hello station, we're bringing cargo, perform certain maneuvers, and precisely come in and park, just like they're parking in a parking lot. Now, there's a lot more work that goes on behind the scenes for that, but it became so commonplace, and I could see these vehicles just out the window, and I thought, look how far we've come. So, to think that we'll have colonies on Mars, that day's probably coming a lot faster than you think.  Gates McFadden: And I just pray, though, that humanity can, maybe, start to learn from our mistakes, instead of repeat them.  Serena Auñón-Chancellor: Yeah.  [ Applause ]  Host: All right. Unfortunately, that's all the time we're going to get, today, so I just want to thank our panel one more time, Gates, Serena, Kris, and Richard, for joining us today.  [ Applause and Cheers ]  And thank all of you beautiful people for being here, as well. I hope you enjoy the rest of Comicpalooza, and go listen to us online, Houston, We Have a Podcast. Thanks.

                        "description": "Gary Jordan (Host): Houston, we have a podcast. Welcome to the official podcast of the NASA Johnson Space Center, Episode 98, Soldier, Physician, Astronaut. I'm Gary Jordan and I'll be your host today. If you're new to the show, we bring in the NASA experts to talk about all the different parts of our agency. Sometimes we get lucky enough to bring in astronauts to talk about their story. So today we're talking with Andrew Morgan, goes by Drew. He's a U.S. astronaut who is about to launch to the International Space Station this July 2019 for his very first spaceflight. We discussed his journey from moving around in a military family, his education to become a medical doctor, his time in the military as a flight surgeon, and parachuting out of planes, and his training that has prepared him for his extended stay in space that will take him through three expeditions over just about nine months. That's a long time to be away from family. So joining us is his wife, Stacey Morgan, to talk about how she and their four children are prepared for Drew's mission. So here's the story of NASA astronaut, medical doctor and U.S. Army colonel, Andrew Morgan. Enjoy.  [ Music ]  Host: Drew and Stacey Morgan, thank you so much for coming on the podcast today. I really appreciate your time, especially this close to launch. I really appreciate you guys -- having you both here today.  Andrew Morgan: Well, thank you for having us.  Stacey Morgan: Yes, thank you.  Host: All right. So, Drew, I wanted to start with -- I wanted to go back and just get your story really. And then, Stacey, how you're interwoven through this, because really, I mean, we are coming up on a launch here soon. I mean, we're talking about the 20th anniversary or the -- sorry, 50th anniversary of Apollo 11 that you were launching. And you're going to be up there for a while. So there's a lot of family elements here. But taking it back all the way to your childhood, you were born in Morgantown, West Virginia. I got to ask, it's not your town. Right?  Andrew Morgan: No, it's certainly not. I was born into a military family. My parents are from Western Pennsylvania originally. And at the time I was born, my dad was finishing dental school at West Virginia University. And then he was commissioned in the Air Force. And that began my life of moving around every couple of years. We lived anywhere from -- in one location maybe two to four years at a time. Lived in California, lived in New York, lived in Texas, lived overseas in Great Britain, lived in Delaware. So that was a big aspect of who I was, was being a military brat that moved around every couple of years.  Host: Yeah. Did you get kind of used to it after a while? Just, \"All right, we're going to pack up and move again. I guess I've got to make new friends.\"  Andrew Morgan: It's all I ever knew as a child was moving every couple of years. And that kind of reset and starting over in a new location became very routine. And I think it made me and both of my brothers very adaptable. And it was something, obviously, that I enjoyed enough that I thought, \"I'm going to have a military career myself.\" And I wanted the same thing, you know, now that I have my own children, was expecting we'd move every couple of years. So it definitely was something I viewed as very positive.  Host: But you said that Western Pennsylvania is your home base.  Andrew Morgan: Home base -- I consider myself -- my hometown to be New Castle, Pennsylvania, which is where my parents and my grandparents are from. But I actually never lived there. It was just where I would return to in summers, for vacations or for holidays. So it's important as a military family to have something to call home when you move around so much. And so it's still part home, but it's just never a place that I actually lived for any duration of time.  Host: I can absolutely relate. Western Pennsylvania for me, too, Cranberry Township.  Andrew Morgan: Really?  Host: Is home base.  Andrew Morgan: Yes. Very nice.  Host: Yeah. Not too far away.  Andrew Morgan: Oh, wow.  Host: But, yeah, my dad was a manager and we moved around. Mostly around the Pennsylvania area. So I was born in Eastern Pennsylvania. And then we moved around. I went to New York as well. But we -- but I guess, you know, Cranberry Township is sort of home base. When I go there, that's where my friends are and everything. But, yeah, I absolutely get it. And I get the value of moving around a lot that it really helps -- especially with me, and I'm sure for you, adapting to new situations throughout your life.  Andrew Morgan: Certainly, adapting to new situations, understanding different cultures, just different parts of the United States. But the European travel that I was able to do as part of living over there, it just really formulated my mind in a way that was very positive, and something that I thought was valuable enough to want to do the same thing for my kids.  Host: And that's kind of where this military career. So it seems like pretty early on you kind of knew you were going to go with the soldier route.  Andrew Morgan: I definitely was interested in being in the military from early on. I have always had an interest in space and aviation and the military, or the combination of all three. But I would say that the -- certainly, something that I viewed as very achievable for me was to be in the military. And I considered all the branches of the service. As it was, I chose to go to West Point, and was commissioned as an Army officer. But I can't remember a time that I didn't want to be in the military.  Host: Now, what about space? Where did that come from? You said there's always been a time. I'm guessing there was some moments in your life where really this kind of had a background, this idea of space.  Andrew Morgan: Yeah, definitely. So because my dad was an Air Force officer and we were around Air Force bases quite a bit, there was that element of aviation that I was always exposed to. And I, certainly, was intrigued by that. At one point we lived in Texas for about five years between Austin and San Antonio. And this was the height of the space shuttle era. And at that time shuttles were launching fairly regularly. And they would be ferried across the country from California to Florida on the shuttle carrier aircraft. And I can remember both when we lived in Austin and San Antonio seeing it fly over on the back of the 747, and also seeing it on the ground, and just remembering, aware of the launches going on that time, the Challenger tragedy occurred while I was living in Texas as a fourth grader. So those things definitely etched in my mind. And space was very much on my conscience and something that I was very interested in. I also often tell the story about when I was a fourth grader in San Antonio during the celebration of the Texas Sesquicentennial, and we all wrote to famous Texans. And I chose to write to Apollo astronaut Alan Bean. And I got a lithograph back from him signed by him. And I was super excited to receive that. And I gave it to the school as part of the celebration. And I often say that that was kind of the seed that was planted at that time when I got that letter back from NASA with, you know, NASA letterhead. It was very exciting. And a special significance since now I'm going to be flying on the ISS for the 50th anniversary of Apollo 12, Alan Bean's mission, and, as you know, he just passed in the last year or so, this is -- it's really unique. And I'll be flying actually an Apollo 12 patch with me, because that was so meaningful to me.  Host: Wow. Yeah, all these images as you're telling them, I'm picturing in my head. Yes, they're going to be images that you're not going to forget. The shuttle on the back and Alan Bean. These are very significant moments. But it was later I think you went to -- you went to West Point. And I think you went for environmental engineering. Right?  Andrew Morgan: I did. I was always interested in math and science. And West Point being a really great engineering school, I thought I should probably major in engineering. And I was able to combine a couple things that I liked. I liked physical geography, I liked engineering, I liked math, I liked biological sciences. And those all combined very well in environmental engineering. And so -- and that was kind of my thinking at the time drew me to that conclusion. Knowing that I was probably interested in going to medical school, I thought it was an interesting supplement to a medical education to have an engineering degree.  Host: Yeah, I can understand that. It's this degree that's broad enough, where you get to explore different elements, and then, you know, you have something subtle in the back of your mind like, \"Yeah, I might go that route, but let's check it all out first, and let me see what I'm really interested in, and then I'll kind of find my focus.\"  Andrew Morgan: Yeah, a unique aspect of the education at West Point is whether you're interested in engineering or not, you will get a fair amount of it, so you might as well just embrace it and finish the degree in it.  Host: Well, so is West Point -- actually, Stacey, this is where -- this is where you come in. Right?  Stacey Morgan: That's right.  Host: Where'd you meet Drew?  Stacey Morgan: We were both cadets together at West Point. I like to think I made his final two years there a little more exciting.  Andrew Morgan: She certainly did.   [Laughter]  Stacey Morgan: But, yeah, that's how we met.  Host: Okay. I guess you met and then, you know, you stayed together, because after West Point --  Stacey Morgan: That’s right.  Host: I think you went to -- Drew you went to Maryland.  Andrew Morgan: I went to Maryland. I had applied to medical school. I got into Uniform Services University, the Health Sciences, in Bethesda, Maryland. And Stacey was finishing her degree at George Washington University in Washington, D.C. So we were nearby each other while she was finishing her degree and I was just beginning medical school.  Host: Okay. Yeah. So you were close. I mean, you were going your own career path, but it was close enough where you can maintain that relationship.  Stacey Morgan: That's right. So we stuck it out, dating for about three plus years, and then got married after I graduated from undergrad.  Host: All right. Three years of distance.  Stacey Morgan: We tried to keep it close.  Andrew Morgan: I mean, we were near. We were very -- it was just a couple minutes away. So it wasn't too far.  Host: Oh, okay. Yeah, that's not really -- yeah, that's not really distance.   Stacey Morgan: A few minutes away.  Andrew Morgan: Yeah, yeah.  Host: Yeah. A few minutes. Okay. So you got married I guess was it -- I guess while you were still in school in Maryland?  Andrew Morgan: I was still in medical school about halfway through when we got married.  Host: I see.  Andrew Morgan: And then Stacey had finished her degree. And we lived in the Gaithersburg, Maryland for the first two years of our marriage while I was finishing up medical school.  Host: Okay. So medical school, you went for emergency medicine. Now, I know there's different paths in medicine that you can go. And I've talked with -- and specifically the one that's coming to mind is Serena Auñón-Chancellor. She went for I believe internal medicine. So there's always -- there's a choice I guess when it comes to the type of medical work that you do. Why'd you choose emergency medicine?  Andrew Morgan: You know, I actually started medical school thinking that I wanted to do emergency medicine. And there were a couple aspects of that. One was there's a strong team component of working in the emergency room. And I always thought that was really neat the way that doctors, nurses and medics worked together to deal with chaos that walks in through the door. I liked being very broad, knowing a little bit about every specialty, kind of being able to deal with anything that walked through the door. That was also really important to me, because I knew that I wanted to do operational medicine, medicine in the field, as a physician of soldiers. And emergency medicine felt like the best preparation for doing that for the career that I wanted to have.  Host: Yeah. You were going -- it seems like -- I mean, for me, this is -- just listening to this, I'm all stressed out with the emergency medicine thing. But even before hand, while you were in West Point, you were actually parachuting with I think it was the Black Knights. Right? So even jumping out of planes. So, Stacey, I mean, how -- I guess you enjoy the danger. Right? You were looking for the --  Stacey Morgan: Well, it was certainly exciting --  Host: Yeah.  Stacey Morgan: To have a boyfriend jumping out of helicopters every day. But, yeah, I mean, ever since I met Drew, he's always been a part of teams. And I think that's part of who he is. He works well in teams. He seeks out teams, high-performing teams, teams that take risks together. And so, I mean, --  Andrew Morgan: Calculated risks.  Stacey Morgan: Calculated risks. That's right.  Host: Calculated risks.  Stacey Morgan: Not irresponsible risk. Yeah. So, I mean, when I first met him, he was on that team. And even, like he said, through medical school and as he was -- we were kind of figuring out what specialty he was going to choose, it was not a surprise that he would choose emergency medicine, both for that team aspect, but also because since the day I met him, you know, I knew -- like, he is a soldier at heart, and he wanted to be back with his soldiers. And so, you know, you kind of have a choice as to whether you're going to try to stay more in the hospital, or you're going to be out more in the field. And I knew -- I always knew he was going to be out in the field with the soldiers. And so that wasn't a huge surprise. And that's kind of been a theme really through his whole life. It's team, it's sacrifice, it's service.  Host: Did you keep up your parachuting skills while you were in the Uniformed Services University?  Andrew Morgan: I would say I took a several year hiatus where I would just occasionally jump, you know, if I was getting together with old teammates. But from the time I left West Point until I finished medical school and residency, I didn't really start jumping again until I went back to the operational army and was in an airborne unit doing static line jumps, where you jump out and the line pulls the parachute out for you. And then I also developed a relationship with the Army Parachute Team, the Golden Knights, and started freefall jumping again. And then eventually went to the Military Freefall Parachutist course, and continued jumping operationally. And so there was a period of time there I wasn't doing it regularly. I usually viewed it as an aspect of my job more so than as a hobby that I did on the weekends. The military enabled me to do it for free, so it was hard for me to pay for that on the weekends when I can do it as an aspect of my job.  Host: Right. But you said -- Stacey, you said that teams were really important to you, Drew. And it seems like, especially when you talked about the Golden Knights parachuting, this is when you were in North Carolina at the Womack Army Medical Center, if that's right.  Andrew Morgan: I was. I was -- when we moved to Fort Bragg, North Carolina I had a couple of different jobs there. And I was a staff physician at Womack Army Medical Center. And I was then the battalion surgeon of a couple of different types of special operations, Special Forces units where my primary responsibility is to take care of the soldiers and the families in that organization.  Host: And that's kind of where I was going with the whole teams' thing is I think while you were, you know, with the Golden Knights you were also a physician. So you had that kind of ability to connect with the folks that you were tending to, if that's -- am I getting that right?  Andrew Morgan: Yeah, absolutely. I mean that was -- my medical skillset always -- always felt like it could always be a contributing member of any team. They definitely saw value in being able to reach out and touch a physician easily, get a hold of me at any hour. My relationship with the Army Parachute Team, but also my relationship with the unit that I was in at the time, Third Special Forces Group, being that -- being available to them, like that was extremely important. And participating in the operational skills, like jumping out of airplanes, diving, flying in helicopters, basic soldier skill types of stuff, to be able to do that well alongside of them gave me a lot of credibility with the soldiers. It felt like that they could confide in me in a different way than they could with a -- if their physician was somebody that they couldn't necessarily relate to. And being alongside them and experiencing those things with them made me approachable, and it made me -- it helped me understand them and their mentality better, and integrate in a different way.  Host: And I'm guessing you took those skills with you on the next thing, which was I guess for the next few years, you were kind of all over the place, but there was this area of deployment I think as well. Right?  Andrew Morgan: Absolutely. Of those five years that we were in North Carolina, I spent over a year deployed overseas between Iraq and Afghanistan, and some short trips to the African continent as well. So my family, at this point was -- you know, we were having -- our family was slowly growing at this time. And so I was deploying, gone frequently and our family was growing on the side. So it was a -- it was a very dense time in my career of trying to balance family with the operational requirements of a very busy army.  Host: Oh, very true. And, Stacey, it's not a walk in the park for you either. It was definitely a busy time.  Stacey Morgan: Yeah, it was very busy. It felt like we would get pregnant, he'd deploy and come back, and a month later we'd have the baby.  Andrew Morgan: Yeah.  Stacey Morgan: So it was like, \"Welcome home. We're about to have another baby.\" Yeah. It was -- but it was good. I mean, what could have been a very challenging time on paper, you would wonder, \"Gosh, how does a family, a spouse get through that many deployments?\" Plus, he went to a number of different schools. There were a lot of more kind of high-risk schools. And, of course, that's more months, you know, cumulative away from the family --  Andrew Morgan: Military schools.  Stacey Morgan: Military schools, yeah. But the key was I was surrounded by other spouses who, you know, understood what -- we were all in the same boat together. We all understood service and sacrifice kind of in a more intimate way than maybe the average person. And so that really made all the difference. What could have been a really hard time actually those five years were some of the best of our army life, even though it was challenging in many ways.  Host: Yeah. That idea of a community. You have a support group --  Stacey Morgan: Yeah.  Host: And have made all the difference.  Stacey Morgan: Yeah.  Andrew Morgan: I mean, I would add to that, I would say that we really thrived. And that's where we developed the skill of being apart, and doing well as a family as a result of that. And not just being apart, but also in very dangerous environments. You know? When Stacey and I met, I was already on the parachute team. She's known that I've been a calculated risk taker [laughter] from the moment she met me. And she knows that's an element of who I am, of being a part of a team and taking these calculated risks as part of that team. That's something that's been a thread throughout my entire career. And she's always been extremely supportive of that. And that goes all the way back to the beginning. And her understanding of that has helped me become the person that I am.  Host: And I'm sure that it's going to transition nicely into you becoming an astronaut. At what point did you decide this is something that I want to pursue, I want to -- I'm going to just start applying?  Andrew Morgan: Well, I mentioned that I had this early on interest in aviation and space. But I never planned my career around how to become an astronaut, clearly, because the pathway that I followed, it was not one that's well known for becoming an astronaut. But I knew that -- I said I -- I always told myself I should apply, I should at least give it a shot. And I didn't have mentors or anybody that had gone that pathway. So I really wasn't sure how I would -- how to pursue that even. I watched the last space shuttle launch in 2011 with my son, who was then seven years old. And I thought when the space shuttle launched that there would be no more astronauts selected. I didn't -- I really didn't know. And then in 2000 -- just within a couple months of that I think, just a few months later, they announced that they were going to select a class in 2013. And I was at a good point in my career at that point, where I thought maybe this is the time to apply. And I remember telling Stacey about it. And I said, \"I'm going to apply and I think --\" I mean, you can speak to it. You can be -- I told her that there's no way I'm going to get selected, so just let me apply. What's the big deal?  Host: Right.  Stacey Morgan: Yeah. Well, like anybody knows, I mean, astronauts when they are selected are usually, you know, obviously, doing extremely well in whatever career field that they have chosen at that point. And usually if you've reached that level of success, you are -- you're all in. You know, you have to be all in. And that includes your family. And so we were all in with what we were doing in the Army. We were about to move to Germany as a family. Literally, the movers had been scheduled. You know, everything was packed up. I was already looking for rental homes online, and getting pretty excited about a couple years of a European experience with our kids. And he said, \"I want to apply.\" And I was like, \"Um… really? Okay.\" And he said, \"Well, don't worry, we're still -- I'm sure we're still going to get our European experience, because the likelihood of me being selected is very low. They've never selected an Army physician before.\" You know, if nothing else, you know, our joke became no matter what, you'll always be a NASA applicant. So we will cherish the rejection letter forever. You know? The problem was he kept making every gate.  Andrew Morgan: I started making cuts along the way. And then it started to -- you know, like Stacey said, I mean, my career was in a good place, I was very satisfied. I often say that if I had not been selected as an astronaut, I would have been very, very fulfilled to continue on the path that I was. I loved my career. I had the dream job I believed. And I still think that it was a dream job. But as I made cuts along the way, it started to become a little more of a reality. And I think Stacey started to think, \"Wait a minute here. You know, I thought you said there was no way this was going to happen. This is really changing how I thought the next aspect of our career, our lives together was going to look.\"  Stacey Morgan: Yeah, that's right. I mean, it went from thousands -- you know, don't worry, there's thousands of people applying. And then it went down to hundreds. And then a hundred. And then a handful, you know --  Andrew Morgan: Still a long shot.  Stacey Morgan: It's still a long shot. Don't worry.  Host: Even at the handful point.  Stacey Morgan: Even at the handful point, you know, you knew -- we knew it was going to be a small class. We knew the likelihood of it was still very small. Drew had met all the other, you know, candidates down at different interview processes. And he'd come back and tell me about these amazing people who he had met, and they are so accomplished and they're so well-spoken and --  Andrew Morgan: And there's no way they'll select me.  Stacey Morgan: And there's no way he's going to be chosen. So don't worry, we're still going to Germany.  Host: Yeah.  Stacey Morgan: Don't let cancel the movers yet. But --  Andrew Morgan: But, nevertheless, in June 2013, I got a phone call from Janet Kavandi, who's now the center director at Glenn. And she was running their selection board and she called and said, \"Would you like to come down and be part of our team?\" And I know those words resonate with me very well. I will -- you know, I’ll admit that I choked up. You know, I cried. I mean, it was unbelievable. And I remember coming home, I didn't call Stacey right away, I actually turned my phone off. I wanted to get home and tell her in person. And she was pulling into the garage, you know, after a busy day of running the kids around --  Stacey Morgan: Well, I wasn't home.  Andrew Morgan: Yeah.  Stacey Morgan: You came home and I wasn't home.  Andrew Morgan: Oh, yeah, I said --  Stacey Morgan: Surprise, surprise. Right?  Andrew Morgan: Yes.  Stacey Morgan: Like, I'm sitting at home waiting. I know. I was out grocery shopping. Which is what most, you know, moms are doing in the middle of the day.  Andrew Morgan: And she pulled into the garage and I told her -- I said, \"I have some bad news and some good news. The bad news is that we're not going to get that European vacation,\" because we were just at this point a week out from shipping our car to Germany. \"But the good news is I'm going to be an astronaut.\" And so --  [Laughter]  Host: How did you react?  Andrew Morgan: I guess that's good news. Right?  Stacey Morgan: I mean, I was -- I think at that point -- when we had reached that point, I was starting to mentally prepare myself that I may have to turn off all of the logistics for a European move, and switch it to Texas, that we may need to adjust our mindset a little. So, yeah, when he -- he called me when I was at the grocery store and he said, \"You know, where are you?\" And I said, \"I'm at the grocery store. Where else would I be?\" And he said, \"I need you to come home.\" And I thought, \"Well, it's either, I mean, obviously, really good or really bad news.\" And when I pulled in and he was waiting in the garage I knew something was up, that he'd gotten the call. And, yeah, I mean, it was a quick turnaround. It was a very quick turnaround from getting the call to needing to actually be down here. And at that point, you know, we had four kids, so, you know, you've got to think about when school starts and having a place to live, and turning off everything for Germany. You know, like Drew said, we were literally a week away from putting our car on a barge to send to Germany. And we had to turn all that off, switch it all to Texas.  Andrew Morgan: And a mentality switch, you know, that we're no longer going to be a military family that's going to move every couple of years, and that we're getting -- you know, going to see the world with the military moving us around now to we're going to go live in Houston for, you know, potentially decades, and really grow a deep taproot here. And so that was kind of -- it really rattled our sense of who we were and where we were headed.  Host: Yeah, it was not only a logistical challenge, because I'm sure a move to Germany was not easy, it wasn't just a couple of days, weeks. I mean, this is a lot of planning --  Stacey Morgan: That's right.  Host: That you just have to chuck --  Stacey Morgan: Right.  Host: And say, \"All right, well, let's start -- let's start and go to Houston instead.\" But that -- yeah, that mentality of basically switching the definition of how you defined your family thus far, now you're going to have roots, roots in Texas. I'm sure even at this point now, do you feel like you have stronger roots in Texas being here for as long as you have?  Stacey Morgan: Well, our kids definitely consider themselves Texans.  Andrew Morgan: Texans.  Host: Texans, nice.  Stacey Morgan: Yeah. I mean, I grew up in New England. And so the thought that I would live in Texas for most of my life is just something I'd really never considered until I got down here. But, yeah, I mean -- but this -- I did not move around a lot as a kid. So this feels familiar. You know, having all your kids graduate from the same school, and have friends that they, you know, meet in kindergarten and graduate with from high school. I'm familiar with that. That was kind of a new thing for Drew to wrap his mind around. There's pluses and minuses to both lifestyles. And so it was that transition from, you know, finding the positives of this new way of doing life.  Andrew Morgan: And six years is a big portion of a child's life. And so at this point, only our oldest two maybe have some memory of living in Virginia and living in North Carolina.  Host: Yeah. But otherwise Texans.  Stacey Morgan: They are Texans.  Andrew Morgan: Yes.  Host: They're going for the Tex-Mex and --yeah.  Stacey Morgan: That's right.  Andrew Morgan: Absolutely.  Host: So tell me about some of your -- some of your first days. You know? Because you were an astronaut candidate for two years. That's a lot of training. Tell me about when you first got to NASA and hit the ground running.  Andrew Morgan: Yeah. There were several aspects of astronaut candidate training. I think one of the most jarring for a lot of us was we got thrust right into Russian language training, which is quite a challenge. We got started on that pretty quickly. For those of us that -- you know, in my class of eight, six of us had military backgrounds, and five of us had some sort of aviation backgrounds as well. And I, along with two of my classmates, Jessica Meir and Christina Koch, because we weren't rated military aviators, we were sent to Pensacola where we learned kind of the fundamentals of being aircrew through the Navy. And as luck would have it, the two -- the three of us spent two months together early on, and kind of built a very strong bond early on. And I'll be flying on the International Space Station with both of them at one point, which is great.  Host: That's awesome.  Andrew Morgan: So flying was an important part of our training. Then from those basics that we developed in Pensacola, we came back and learned to be crew members in the T-38, which is our supersonic jet trainer that we use for what we call Space Flight Readiness Training. And it just helps us hone those skills of good crew interaction using checklists, and working in an environment that is actually quite dangerous, and has that element of risk that we are constantly mitigating. We learned systems on the International Space Station. We learned the fundamentals of robotics and operating the robotic arm. And then a big part of what we do also is just bond as a class. And, you know, I continually come back to that team concept, and what we call in the astronaut core expeditionary skills, those skills that build good teams and make you a good teammate. Because living onboard the International Space Station for months at a time, being a good teammate, has been proven time and time again as important as the technical skills. And so we did things like went on geology trips where that involved camping, or we participated in short expeditions, you know, through the National Outdoor Leadership School, NOLS. My class went to Wyoming and did a nine-day trip. And those things stand out in my mind as much as any of the technical training, is getting to know and function in a team. You know, sometimes the chemistry is not -- it's not perfect. And you learn how to work through tough times together. But I can say that my seven other classmates, the eight of us together, we're like family now. And we're all assigned to flights right now. And at one point I'll be on board the ISS with -- there will be four from my class alone on board the ISS together. We could never have imagined that that would be the case. And because we forged those bonds so many years ago and have built these family-like relationships, the ISS program is going to benefit from the fact that we -- you know, that we know each other so well, and that our families know each other so well.  Stacey Morgan: Yeah. I'd add that in those first two years, we spent a lot of time as families socially together --  Andrew Morgan: Yeah, absolutely.  Stacey Morgan: Which is very important, not just for the spouses, the spouses of the other fellow eight-balls are some of my best friends, but for our kids as well. You know, it's a good thing when sometimes they forget how unusual it is to have a parent who is an astronaut. They really don't always fully comprehend how unique that is, because they have so many friends in their own schools, in their neighborhoods, down the street that they play with, you know, almost every day, whose dads and moms do the exact same thing. And it's no big deal. It's, \"Oh, yeah, your dad's in Russia this week? Yeah, my mom's in Japan. And they're going to be on the space station together.\" You know? Like, no big deal. It could be anything. Which is great, because it helps balance out what could be very stressful times. You know, there are times when people want to talk to them, and ask them, you know, \"How do you feel about this? And isn't this crazy that your dad's going to the space station?\" And sometimes they don't even know how to answer that question, because it's kind of an adult question, but also it’s they haven't thought of it as being super unusual, because they have 15 friends --  Andrew Morgan: Yeah, they have peers that --  Stacey Morgan: Whose parents have already gone --  Andrew Morgan: Yeah.  Stacey Morgan: And will be going next year. You know? So it's not a big deal.  Host: Man, this area just blows my mind. That is a normal thing around here. Just, \"Oh, yeah, your dad's in space? Oh, yeah, mine's going to go in a couple --\"  Stacey Morgan: Yeah, mine's going up next week.  Host: Yeah.  Stacey Morgan: Yeah, they'll be together.  Andrew Morgan: We're also really thankful for those friends, like Stacey said, that the spouses have this relationship and our children have this relationship, and they're -- you know, we're growing up. We say we're doing life together. And we support each other. It's really a unique aspect. It reminds us a lot of what it was like to be in a military unit in many ways. So it's been a fantastic experience. And just grateful for the ability to lean on each other like that.  Host: And I think that's going to be especially important for you, Drew, because you're going to spend a little bit longer in space. Right? I think about nine months.  Andrew Morgan: Yes. My mission's going to be a little bit longer than the standard ISS expedition. But I won't be the only. Christina Koch, my classmate, will be on board for even longer than I will be. And we'll get to overlap together on that for about seven months. And I know that she feels the same way, which is we view this as part of our duty. We're both very service oriented, and this is what the ISS program needs for the benefit of science, for the benefit of the presence on the International Space Station, that we stay longer. And, you know, while the announcement wasn't that long ago that we were being extended, the writing had been on the wall for a little while, and we had been prepped for it. And the chief astronaut, Pat Forrester, had been in dialogue with us for many months about it, and making sure that we were comfortable with it. So I'd been able to prepare Stacey. And Christina were able to prepare her husband, Bob, for this possibility. And so it wasn't a surprise. And they fully embraced it. And just the sense that this is our service to the ISS program, service to the international partnership, makes it very, very exciting to be a part of it.  Host: So, Stacey, do you feel -- do you feel ready? And the four kids, too, do you feel --  Stacey Morgan: Oh, I don't think you can ever feel fully ready.  Host: Yeah.  Stacey Morgan: I mean, it is such a unique experience. I've, certainly, never lived with a spouse orbiting above me. But, you know, we're doing our best to prepare in the best way that we can. And then I think having the attitude of flexibility and adjusting as we go, because I think there will be several aspects that you just can't prepare for until you get there, because it is different for every -- even though I have great relationships with other spouses who have experienced this, and they have passed their wisdom on to me, and, certainly, are supporting me as I prepare, every family situation is different, because your relationship is different, your kids are different, the time is different, different things happen while they are, you know, on board the space station. So it's hard to know exactly how you will feel, or what will happen while they're gone. But, yeah, we're doing our best.  Host: But if anyone's ready, I think -- I mean, I can say with confidence, it seems like you're ready. You have the -- you have the background of being a military family, adapting to new situations. Plus, as you said, this is a strong community group. Even you said just your class alone, but has this strong bond. But the area itself is full of people who are ready to support you. It seems like -- it seems like things are sort of going your way. But at the same time, you're right, it's not super predictable.  Stacey Morgan: No. And definitely having experienced deployments in the past, I mean, you learn how to ask for help. That is a skill that most of us don't do well, because it's hard to be independent and be able to, you know, keep your family moving while also asking for help, and accepting that help when people offer it to you. Learning how to say no, and, you know, simplify things and not feel false obligation to do things that you really just don't have the margin to do when you are single parenting for an extended period of time. Those are all skills that definitely started to learn when we were in the military. But, you know, our kids are a lot older now. And there's more of them than there were when we did deployments. And there's a -- you know, nine months Drew will be gone pretty much an entire summer and an entire school year. And that's a -- you know, that's a long time in the life of an eight-year-old. And even the life of a fifteen-year-old. You know, our son will learn to drive while Drew's gone. You know, our daughter will finish junior high, and she'll be prepared to go into high school when he gets back. And there's a lot of life. And so there's that challenge of moving life forward, which we have to do whether Drew is with us or not. But also helping him feel connected and a part of what we're doing. That's kind of the biggest challenge.  Host: So are you ready, Drew, to be away from the family for that long?  Andrew Morgan: You know, it's really hard for me actually to think about the huge piece of my children's life and Stacey's life that I will miss. But, you know, as I alluded to earlier, when I was 18 years old I made the decision to serve my country. And then I made the decision along the way to become an astronaut. And I view this as a continuation of that service. So I'm not just serving my country now, I'm serving this thing bigger than myself. And that is what is going to drive me, and keep me going. Because if I focus too much on what I'm going to be missing out in their lives, it really -- it's just -- sometimes it's too hard to bear. So really as a family, we have to focus on the service aspect. And Stacey does a good job of rationalizing that to our children. She's always very positive in the way that she speaks about it, and the importance of this service, just the way she did when I would -- when I was gone in Iraq and Afghanistan. The children were younger then. They couldn't quite understand that. But now it absolutely resonates with them. And then knowing that we're going to have really good connectivity, you know, we'll be able to talk from the phone, we'll be able to videoconference, I think, you know, Stacey and I are thinking about projects and things that we can work on together. A couple of weeks ago I got together with Scott Kelly and just asked of him about the -- you know, what were some of his lessons learned from being away for as long as he was, and what would he recommend to me. And one of the things he mentioned was trying to have a few projects that you're working on with your spouse. And so, you know, we like to do home improvement projects. And I know it sounds crazy to do a home improvement project from space, but, you know, Stacey is -- you know, she enjoys it, too. And one of the things that we like to do is kind of plan it and talk about it, and kind of go back and forth. And, I mean, we've talked about a couple things that we might even try. Maybe we're crazy if we're trying to do home improvement projects from --  Stacey Morgan: We'll find out.  Andrew Morgan: From space. But we also talked about doing things like maybe running a half marathon together, where I run it on the treadmill or something, and she does the same one, and we listen to the same --  Stacey Morgan: Yeah, listen to the same music at the same time or something.  Andrew Morgan: Same music, same playlist. So we kind of know where we're -- you know, where we are. We'll start it simultaneous. You know, we're just trying to think of little things like that that we can -- that we can stay connected, little projects that we know that we're both working on, and help drive conversation, prevent it from becoming too routine.  Host: Yeah, yeah. I like the idea of doing these nice ways to connect. But then also setting goals for the future. And I think it'll make the time fly. But I'm sure -- you know, that's a long time to be away from family and on the station. But you're going to be doing a lot. You have a very important job, as you said. A service to the space community, to science. There's a lot that you can do. What can we look forward to you doing over these nine months?  Andrew Morgan: Well, of course, the most important thing that we'll be doing on board the ISS is running science payloads. And before -- when I was a candidate, and even prior to me being assigned, the concept of science onboard the ISS was kind of -- we didn't get a lot of training in specific payloads, because they're constantly changing. And so the idea of conducting an experiment in space was strictly conceptual. But now that I'm a year and a half into my training, and I've been trained on specific payloads and specific projects that I'll be participating in, now I've got a lot of buy-in in seeing some of those -- you know, I'll be one of the last subjects for fluid shifts. And that is a really interesting study to me. It involves a lot of ultrasound, which was an interest of mine in my medical career as well. And so I'll be participating in that, and that will be quite an investment of my time while I'm on board. We also have quite a few spacewalks planned. And I'm looking forward to being able to do these spacewalks potentially with my classmates or with my crewmate Luca Parmitano. It'll be -- it's going to be really -- it's going to be an exciting time. And then then there's also the possibility that some of the first U.S. crew vehicles could visit while we're there, which will be -- that will be, you know, historic. And to see people come up, you know, that we know well. It's like having, you know, people -- and we're not sure exactly when they'll come. And when they do, it'll be really exciting to see these familiar faces come on board the ISS with us.  Host: Yeah, yeah. Definitely a busy time, an important time. You're going to be doing a lot of different things. You know, speaking of science investigations, particularly because of your background as a physician, is there anything you're particularly looking forward to or interested in? Just even curious about from your medical training about what's going to happen to your body in space?  Andrew Morgan: So I didn't have an extensive background in space medicine prior to being selected. So a lot that I've learned about space medicine has been here as an astronaut. And there's no experience quite like personal anecdotal experience to talk about things like how you adapt to space, and how you do just basic functions. And so I'm very interested in doing that. From a professional perspective, that I'll be able to speak about it much more intelligently now after I've gone through it. And not just gone through it, but gone through it for a long period of time, and talk about the aspects of the body changing.  Stacey Morgan: And then changing back.  Andrew Morgan: Yep, and then changing back after you come home.  Host: Then changing back. Stacey, do you have -- do you have plans for how you're going to carry through these nine months? I mean, besides the connection with Drew, and, of course, the home projects?  Stacey Morgan: Oh, yes. Well, I mean, personally, I like to have projects to do. And I always like to try to find the positive. I mean, it's never fun when your -- you know, when your best friend is gone for a long period of time. So you have to focus on the positives. Like I'm sure I will binge watch tons of shows that Drew doesn't want to watch. And I will make whatever I want for dinner without asking any other adult what they're having. You know, there are tiny little things you can do that just help the time feel a little less painful. But, yeah, it'll be the creative connection things that we'll try to do that will make it, you know, worthwhile. Our kids are terrible phone talkers. You know, none of them -- kids don't talk on the phone anymore. They text each other, they FaceTime each other. But talking on the phone would be the primary way that we will communicate with Drew. And so a big task is going to be training my kids to talk on the phone, which I think is something that any parent can, you know, understand. Like, kids are just -- they're just terrible. So that's going to be a big skill we have to work on.  Host: Yeah.  Andrew Morgan: We're going to ask them to journal a little bit, to kind of think about the things they want to update me on, so that we do, you know, make sure that they --  Stacey Morgan: That's right.  Andrew Morgan: You know, that they all have their opportunity to speak to me one-on-one, and talk about the things that they would otherwise forget if they hadn't written them down in their journal.  Host: Well, okay, so there's -- it sounds like you have a lot of plans to stay connected, which is very -- going to be very important over these next nine months. In terms of being in space, any tricks you've gotten from some of your colleagues, any tips on what to do? I mean, even you said Scott Kelly especially for the length of time. But just adapting to space or anything that really sticks in your mind?  Andrew Morgan: Yeah. So I've been in communication with Nick Hague, Anne McClain and Christina Koch, who are on board right now. And as I mentioned, they're my classmates. And so it makes it very easy to send them emails and talk on the phone. You know, we've talked multiple times, and email exchanges almost daily as they're preparing for our arrival. But hearing it from their perspective is so much more meaningful than talking to a senior astronaut who's done it multiple times. You know, like Scott Kelly's flown and been in space for, you know, 500 some odd days. And so hearing it from him is very different than hearing it from my classmates, who are just experiencing the first couple of weeks. And so that has a different value for me. The other thing that really helps is that when they communicate to me, they reassure me the training is excellent. You have, you know, everything you need to know. We just want you to get here. We have everything ready for you to go. We'll have everything set up. We'll teach you to do everything that can't be taught on the ground. Don't worry about a thing. And getting those types of messages and phone calls from them is -- that's the value of having a classmate on board the ISS, to know that I'm going to be welcomed and that I'm going to see familiar faces that I love, and that I know that they're going to take great care of me and teach me what I need to know. It just makes it comforting for me, makes it comforting for my family to know that my transition will be smooth.  Host: Yeah. See, your connection with teams and your desire to be part of a team I guess extends even off the planet, on the planet, between off and on the planet. You know, you're going to be connecting with your family, connecting with your crew base, having these strong bonds. It sounds crucial to get through these nine months. It's going to be -- it's going to be very interesting. Drew and Stacey, thank you so much for coming on the podcast, and telling your story. This was absolutely fascinating. And, Drew, Godspeed on your mission. I really am looking forward to seeing your mission over these next couple of months.  Stacey Morgan: If there's just one thing I could say --  Host: Oh, please.  Stacey Morgan: Because I don't often have the opportunity to speak to this audience. But I just wanted to personally thank all of the NASA employees. I know there are thousands of employees and contractors who show up every day, and they do their job with a level of dedication and diligence and precision that most of us cannot even comprehend. And those all add up to mission success. But for me personally, for our family, mission success is really -- it's so much more than science and exploration. For us, ultimate mission success is the safe return home of my husband, my best friend, the father of my four children. And I just want to thank sincerely all those NASA employees for what they do. On behalf of my family, on behalf of our extended family, and really on behalf of all of the astronaut families who have launched in the past and will launch in the future, you know, you hold our heart in your hands every day that you do what you need to do. And we value you so much. So in all sincerity, thank you so much on behalf of all of the astronaut families.  Host: That's wonderful. It takes a village.  Andrew Morgan: Well, and thanks, Stacey, for saying that, because I don't think I could add anything else to that, because that expressed all the gratitude that I could possibly muster. And thanks for having us both here to talk about the unique aspects of a mission coming up. And I appreciate -- just really appreciate the time.  Host: I appreciate your time. Thanks. Godspeed.  [ Music ]  Host: Hey, thanks for sticking around. So today we got to talk to Colonel Andrew Morgan and his wife Stacey Morgan just right before his launch coming up this July. So if you want to watch it, go to nasa.gov/NTV, and you can tune in on the 50th anniversary of the Apollo 11 moon landing. That's July 20th, 2019. He's going to be launching with his crewmates, Luca Parmitano and Alexander Skvortsov. He's going to be launching to the International Space Station for nine months. And while he's there, he's going to be with a few of his classmates, as he described during today's podcast, that he graduated with, or at least were selected with, in the class of 2013. We've interviewed a couple of them before. If you want to check out Episode 65 to listen to Nick Hague's story, and Episode 82 to listen to Christina Koch. Both will be on the same time as Colonel Morgan. Now, as I said, this is the 50th anniversary of the Apollo 11 moon landing that Andrew Morgan is launching to the space station on July 20th. We've done a couple episodes here on the podcast dealing with the Apollo 11 50th anniversary, so for all things Apollo, we have a collection for you. It's at nasa.gov/Johnson/HWHAP/Apollo50th. You can also go to nasa.gov/podcasts for all the other podcasts that we have through the NASA Johnson Space Center.

                        "description": "Gary Jordan: Houston, we have a birthday. Welcome to the official podcast of the NASA Johnson Space Center, Episode 99. I'm Gary Jordan and I'll be kicking off this discussion today. Two years ago, this week, we launched the very first Episode of Houston, We Have a Podcast and what a ride it has been. We've brought in so many scientists, engineers, astronauts to talk about a huge variety of topics, and to share some of their incredible stories. So, to celebrate another great year of Houston, We Have a Podcast, the podcast team is going in front of the mics once again to talk about our favorite moments from this past year of Episodes. Today, I'm sitting down with producer an audio engineer Alex Perryman, as well as producer and host, Pat Ryan, and host, Dan Huot. So, if you're new to the show, this should give you some great perspective on some of the conversations we've had so far. Happy birthday to us! Let's jump right ahead to reminiscing with the podcast team. Enjoy.  [ Music ]  Gary Jordan: One more year down, guys. We are two years into the podcast. How's everyone feeling? Alex, how you feeling two years in?  Alex Perryman: Feeling good.  Gary Jordan: You were one of the original people that actually helped to start this off. Does it feel like two years?  Alex Perryman: Yeah, it feels great, you know, it feels nice to be the -- the OG in the group.   [Laughter]  Gary Jordan: That’s true -- well, you -- you definitely -- it was me and you definitely from the beginning. Dan, you actually were part of Episode 1, which was more like the introduction to let's see if we can do this.  Dan Huot: Yeah, let's -- let's see how bad and we are make sure we can actually do this and then try to fix it.  Gary Jordan: That's why the first four minutes of that Episode do not exist.  Dan Huot: They never, ever saw the light of the day.  Gary Jordan: Well, that's what it was, it was us trying to figure this out. And then we got where -- I feel like this is like a regular thing now, we're doing it -- we're doing it weekly and now we have --Alex, you're part of the regular team. Pat, now you're part of the regular team and have been for over a year now?  Pat Ryan: Probably -- yeah, a little over a year.  Gary Jordan: Okay, and we have Norah who's behind us snapping pictures.  Pat Ryan: Hi, Norah.  Norah Moran: Hi.  Dan Huot: She's pointing bright lights in our eyes.  Gary Jordan: All right, so today, I'm going to do -- remember how what we did last year, basically, just sat down and sort of reminisced, pulled out our favorite clips. I've pulled out some of my favorite moments and I hope you guys have done the same, and just want to go from when I guess the day the -- the week -- sorry -- after the last birthday Episode. So, starting with that week, Episode 53 was Stan Love.  [Transition Music]  Stan Love: And by the way, the toilet is part of your water and oxygen supply, just --  Gary Jordan: Ah, so if the toilet breaks, that also means that you're going to be able to --  Stan Love: Yeah. Yeah, what a way to die, right? I was going to be the brave first explorer on Mars and I died because the toilet broke, that's not going to look good.  [Transition Music]  Gary Jordan: And actually, I looked online, this Episode -- sorry, Dan, beat the Episode 1 with you.   Alex Perryman: Yep.  Gary Jordan: This one now has the most downloads of any Episode that we've ever done.  Pat Ryan: Well, it is Stan Love.  Dan Huot: Now my life is meaningless.  Pat Ryan: Now?  [Laughter]  Dan Huot: Thank you, Pat.  Gary Jordan: A lot of love in this room.  Pat Ryan: Now you’re paying attention.   Gary Jordan: But interestingly enough that one was actually -- almost didn't happen because Stan Love, we were supposed to record for two purposes, one was to try to see how much time we had and maybe we can get another Episode out of him. But really, Stan Love was supposed to record extra audio clips for the hazard series we were doing with human research program because we got together all these different people that they laid out, that they wanted to talk through these five hazards, and Stan Love and Mike Barratt were going to add to that from the astronaut perspective. I forget exactly what happened. Alex, help me remember. I think like we were supposed to record in this room where we are Studio A.  Alex Perryman: Yes.  Gary Jordan: But I think everything -- everything was doubled booked.  Alex Perryman: Everything that could go wrong went wrong that day.  Gary Jordan: Yes.  Alex Perryman: It was to the point where I think I was double booked as being the audio engineer.  Gary Jordan: What were you supposed -- what were -- what were you doing instead?  Alex Perryman: There was a -- I think there was like an in-flight event going on, so there was like a live event going on, and in some kind of way, this room got double booked and we were the smallest thing on the chain, so we got kicked out of this room. And then we ended up having to go into a closet that's next to a bathroom.  Gary Jordan: Well, we have -- we have -- we have this studio, right? We have Studio B, we have another studio, and we have a sound booth, and all three of those were taking up.  Alex Perryman: Yes. Were taken.  Gary Jordan: So we ended up going literally into a closet next to the bathrooms. Actually, if you listen to that Episode, you can hear a little bit of foot traffic in the background of people going back and forth because we had to get jammed to do that -- but what was interesting is Stan Love absolutely loved recording that Episode.  Alex Perryman: Yeah.  Gary Jordan: He's -- he had another conflict that he was backed up right against to record this Episode and he goes, don't worry about it. He goes, I can -- I can spend another 30 minutes. We recorded an extra 30 minutes, got everything, got this solo episode and all the clips used for hazard series and at the end, he's like, if you ever want me to do this again, like let -- just let me know and I'll -- and I'll come out and come on and do that again, so we have to have Stan Love back.  Dan Huot: And that -- it doesn't surprise me that he's one of the top episodes because he's such a good storyteller.  Gary Jordan: He is.  Dan Huot: He’s been giving the talks about why going to Mars is so hard and things like that for years and it's captivating.  Alex Perryman: Yeah.  Dan Huot: Because he takes something that's just obviously one of the hardest things humanity could ever do and he boils it down into oh, I can actually understand how why this is so freaking hard to pull off.  Gary Jordan: And actually, if you go online, the reason that -- while I had him for this hazard series that I wanted to focus on this specifically is because he's done a lecture. Just like you said, he's been doing the same lecture, but there's like a 40 minute online thing you can find on YouTube somewhere, where he goes through why Mars is hard. And what I did was I organized a sort of topic based script. And wanted to hit as much as I could to replicate what was in that -- that talk but I couldn't hit everything because I had such a short amount of time with him, so we'll definitely have to have him on. But that's where we kicked off the hazard series, that was -- that was part of it. Working with Mel Whiting and the human research program. Mike Barratt was the same way too.   Alex Perryman: Yeah.  Gary Jordan: I recorded him in the studio. We did his -- same thing, I wanted to do an episode solo with him, and I wanted to do some clips for the hazard series, but we ran out of time. And he goes, you know what? Just schedule more time with me, I'll be happy to come back, and we -- and we'll redo this. And I sent him the new script and he -- and he literally did more research on each of the hazards to make it as good as possible.   Pat Ryan: Gee.  Gary Jordan: So, that -- so that episode, the one with Mike Barratt is -- the first half, where we were talking about his story, was the first time we recorded. And the second half, which is just the five hazards, was the second time we recorded, where he researched all of the different things, and they're back to back, and I think that was one of the longer episodes we have, like an hour thirty. But those also did pretty well in terms of downloads, all of the different hazards, Zarana Patel, Tom Williams, Erik Antonsen, when we recorded with those guys, Peter Norsk, Brian Crucian, those actually performed a lot better than some of our other stuff.   [Transition Music]  Gary Jordan: Yeah, and -- and if -- and if I'm going to the dentist and they're going around the corner when I'm getting blasted with x-rays, I'm sure no one is really going to sign up for -- to get blasted with, you know, radiation as to find out what happens in your body.  Zarana Patel: Yeah, no one -- unfortunately, we cannot irradiate people.  Gary Jordan: You say that from a scientific perspective.  Zarana Patel: Yes. Yes, of course. So, we rely heavily on animal and cellular models to gather the evidence we need to characterize the risk from space radiation and to do -- evaluate countermeasures.  [Transition Music]  Gary Jordan: And that's why I think why we continued with more and more series after that one.  Alex Perryman: Yeah.  Gary Jordan: Because this was sort of a pilot. This is when we did like the going back in time for the International Space Station Begins for the 20th anniversary of the first element launches and stuff like that. Going through, I'm just kind of hitting these different highlights right now. But Episode 63, that was an interesting day because Pat, you were trying to dedicate that day to recording John Hanson for the Heroes series. But we got -- again -- kicked out of everywhere. But this time, it was –  Pat Ryan: Starting with this room.  Gary Jordan: Starting with this room that we're in right now but it was not something that we could undo because the Vice President, Mike Pence, was coming here.  Pat Ryan: Yeah.  Gary Jordan: And Jim Bridenstine, the administrator had a whole day planned. So, Pat, what did you have to do to accommodate John Hansen?  Pat Ryan: Well, the week before, my interview that we had scheduled with Hansen -- and he had agreed to fly in from Dallas to come down and do the whole thing. And the week before, we found out that the Vice President was coming, it was a big surprise, I mean, you know, secret at the time, but we couldn't be in here. This Studio A is only a couple hundred feet from the auditorium where the Vice President was going to be, so the Secret Service had commandeered the room. And we were made to look someplace else in a different building. And we ended up in a -- in a conference room in the astronaut office, over in the astronaut office building. And that was okay, but that was a room that we couldn't even get into without somebody's help because we -- we didn't -- none of us have the -- the clearance to get into that building. But on Monday morning of this week, we were going to do the interview with Hansen on Thursday afternoon. After we'd been told that we couldn't come in here, even after we had shifted the time, on that Thursday morning, we were told that the administrator needed to move his podcast, which had been in the morning, to that afternoon to the same time that our interview with John Hansen was going to be. So, at 8 o'clock in the morning, I'm emailing Hansen in Dallas saying, can we move this to another time. And he said, yeah, sure, but I got to go now, I got to go to the airport. So, that left us in a room that we couldn't really access without the help from somebody who was actually in that building. We went over there in the morning and set up to do an interview with Mr. Bridenstine and the JSC Center Director Mark Geyer, and then had to leave because everybody had other things to do for the whole Vice President Commercial Crew Palooza that was going on. So, the -- by the time we went back over to the other building in the afternoon for you to talk to Mr. Bridenstine and Mr. Geyer, Dr. Hansen was showing up in what was the middle of that interview, so he got to come -- actually come into the room and see the end of that, which was something that we hadn't planned for him. And because we were there later in the day, when we left, we get to go down in the elevator with Doug Hurley, who is one of the Commercial Crew astronauts, who had just been announced that day, so that was kind of a treat for Dr. Hansen too. But it all happened in a way that was not the way we had it carefully planned out, shall we say.  Alex Perryman: Do you know what? That was also the same day that me and Norah had to go do another shoot with the administrator in another building and it was scheduled right after the podcast ended that shoot was supposed to start. So, me and Norah were trying to book it out of there to get to that building before he got there, and hopefully, everything was still set up. And we were -- we were the first ones out the -- out of the room, but they grabbed the elevator before us so we had to like kind of patiently wait and then run to beat them in. And we beat them by like maybe like 30 seconds. And then like the administrator just kind of looked at me and Norah, like I just -- I just saw you guys. And then he’s like wow, you guys got over quick.  Pat Ryan: Stop stalking me.  Alex Perryman: And I looked at him, I was like, do you believe in magic? And then he was like huh? And everyone just started laughing. And I was like, I'm a wizard, that's why they call me the audio wizard.  Gary Jordan: That's true. A flashback to a year ago where I think I first called you the audio wizard when I think it was John accidentally deleted all of the files and you had to resurrect -- literally resurrect the files from out of nowhere, so that's why you are the audio wizard.  Pat Ryan: That's a story that never gets old.  Gary Jordan: Yes, it is. That was -- that that was interesting too because for the Jim Bridenstine, Mark Geyer podcast, we scaled it up a bit, so there was -- it wasn't like this. Like right now, we're kind of scaled down a bit. We have a portable audio recorder, we have microphones, but this is -- we had like the whole set. We had -- we had --  Pat Ryan: It was on video.   Gary Jordan: It was on video. Yeah.  Alex Perryman: Exactly.  Gary Jordan: So, we scaled it up a bit to make that happen.  Pat Ryan: And now it's on YouTube, so you can see it.  [Transition Music]  Jim Bridenstine: Yeah, as we've talked about sending American astronauts on American rockets from American soil, all of that is fantastic, but these commercial crew providers, in many -- they have seats, they have seven seats on their space craft, which means we could be flying tourists to the International Space Station.  [Transition Music]  Gary Jordan: Episode 64 is where we have Norah Moran come on. [Cheers] Yay, Norah! Guys, if you're looking at -- if you go to Houston, We Have a Podcast, the pages on nasa.gov and see all the cool pictures all throughout some of the different shoots and different moments that we've done, that is all Norah making that happen, even gifs and stuff on the last one. I remember the splash was, it's Spaceship Crash Testing, you put a gif in there, that was pretty cool. So, welcome to have Norah on the team. Bill Stafford was a great help as well. Episode 65 with Nick Hague, that was an interesting episode.  Alex Perryman: Yes.  Gary Jordan: Because what we do to record astronauts is, we have a certain amount of time that we try to get a bunch of different products. We try to get astronaut moments; we try to get all these -- mostly video products but have recently introduced the podcast. And when Nick Hague came on, we knew that his wife, Catie Hague was going to come and we had this idea, maybe we should bring her on the podcast. Problem is, we didn't tell her. We didn't give her the heads-up that she was going to come on the podcast. So, when you hear Catie Hague come on, that is her genuinely reacting to, oh, okay, I guess I'm doing this because she literally had no idea. But she handled it like a champ, she's a public affairs officer herself, so she -- I think she's very much used to all of that.  [Transition Music]  Nick Hague: But it was eye-opening because of that stark difference.  Gary Jordan: Eye-opening and cold. You seem to like cold places.  Nick Hague: I've changed that now, right?  Gary Jordan: Yeah, now being in Houston a little bit differently. At what point did you meet your wife, Catie?  Nick Hague: Speak of the devil.  Gary Jordan: Hey. Catie, you want to come here?  Catie Hague: Sure.  Nick Hague: You can participate.  Catie Hague: Do I have a choice?  Gary Jordan: You don't have to.  Nick Hague: We're doing a podcast.  Gary Jordan: Yeah.  Catie Hague: Fun.  Gary Jordan: So, was this -- did you guys meet during your bachelor's or --  Nick Hague: Yeah, so at the -- at the Air Force Academy, at the Air Force Academy. We both graduated in 1998, so we were in the same squadron the last two years there. It's kind of funny, you know, we had lunch together every day for two years.  Gary Jordan: Really? As friends?  Catie Hague: Right.  Nick Hague: We didn't -- we didn't get married until two years after graduation.  Gary Jordan: Oh, really? Okay.  Nick Hague: So, yeah, it was just --  Gary Jordan: So, what were you studying? Were you studying -- were you similar programs?  Catie Hague: I was studying law.  Gary Jordan: Law? Okay, so not similar.  Catie Hague: Not similar.  Gary Jordan: But just same kind of --  Catie Hague: I am not as smart on the technical side, let's put it that way.  [Transition Music]  Gary Jordan: But what's interesting about that, Dan, is this sparked a whole series of episodes with astronauts and their spouses, that's when you recorded was with Christina Koch.  Dan Huot: Yeah and it's cool to get the spouses in there too, just because it helps you get kind of the full encapsulation of their story. Astronauts are -- I mean even for us here at NASA, almost these mythical beings, where they're all steely eyed missile men, or insane scientists, and all of these super accomplished people that you forget, like, these are people. And so, having their spouse on and just you learn about the strength of the family that surrounds a lot of these people and the support that they get, and it's like the support that anybody else out there in the world relies on, they're just the same.  Gary Jordan: Yeah, that was huge. I think talking with astronauts, I absolutely love the privilege. I know that was a big theme for the most recent episode, Drew Morgan's podcast, where Stacey came on. My favorite though was Episode 74, Anne McClain. I remember earlier that year, every year, my family does a family reunion around July timeframe, and I ran into an uncle there that actually doesn't normally come to those things, so it was kind of cool seeing him, my Uncle Mike Jordan. And he is a helicopter pilot for the Army and happened to bring up Anne's name, like, you wouldn't happen to know an astronaut named Anne McClain, I'm like, yeah, I think, I think I do. And he said, tell her I said hi. And I go, okay. And in my mind, I knew later that -- a couple months later, I was going to be recording this with Anne McLain, did not tell her at all that I was going to bring up my Uncle Mike, so again, genuine reaction when I brought her up that she was going to be doing that.  Pat Ryan: Yeah, well, you couldn't see it on the podcast, but her eyes got real big when Gary said, do you know a guy named Mike Jordan. And she goes, how do you know him? [Laughter]  [Transition Music]  Gary Jordan: All right. So, I'm going through the different types of aircraft and I'm definitely not going to list them all, but one of the ones that stuck out to me was the C-12 -- is it Huron King Air?   Anne Mcclain: Mmhmm.  Gary Jordan: King Air. Did you -- were taught by a pilot, Mike Jordan?  Anne Mcclain: How'd you know that?  Gary Jordan: That's my uncle and he says, hi.  Anne Mcclain: Really?  Gary Jordan: Yeah.  Anne Mcclain: I was. That's very funny and it's funny that -- because I was actually just talking about him, you can tell him that.  Gary Jordan: Really?  Anne Mcclain: Because he has this incredible way of teaching, where he is very charismatic.  [Transition Music]  Gary Jordan: I think another thing we did pretty well this year was trying a bunch of different live shows.  Alex Perryman: Yeah.  Gary Jordan: If you remember Episode 67 with writing excuses, that was actually months in the making to try to make that happen. We got a tip from actually some engineer who happened to know one of the authors, knew they were coming on, and we just kind of scaled this thing up to eventually, it became a podcast and an internal event where we did everything on stage.  [Transition Music]  Mary Robinette Kowal: That has just come out as a book.  Dan Wells: As a book, yes, it's called How to Invent Everything. And the idea is that if you accidentally get thrown into the past, you will be able to recreate electricity, and penicillin, and all these other things, so that's a pretty nice one to have.  Howard Tayler: So, that book wrapped in a towel.  Kjell Lindgren: All right, so from personal experience, I would say a spoon.  Dan Wells: Now we'll tell you the real answer.  Kjell Lindgren: This is for low Earth orbit, I'm not saying planetary, you know, a spoon is important.  [Transition Music]  Gary Jordan: A fun fact about that one. Actually, I'm -- I actually still talk with Mary Robinette Kowal, she's actually --  Alex Perryman: Really?  Gary Jordan: Yeah, she's actually -- yeah, she's a really cool person and always is interested to find out what we're doing even now and is still an active listener of the podcast. But interesting part about that live performance is I -- or performance -- but live presentation, I was kind of nervous that the crowd wasn't going to react because I was -- in my head, I built up this like grand event and we probably -- we probably got I say a hundred people at the -- at the Teague Auditorium, which is better than I think I was expecting, but it was still like I imagined 700, right? So, before we recorded the podcast, I said, hey, everyone, if you can give a big warm JSC welcome for this podcast, that would be amazing. Okay, we're going to start recording now. Hey, everybody, welcome, to the first live recording of Houston, We Have a Podcast, and the erupted.  Dan Huot: Yay.  Gary Jordan: Yeah, it was great. I know, Dan, when you did the Gates McFadden one --  Dan Huot: That's what happened. [Laughter]  Gary Jordan: When you did the Gates McFadden one, they erupted, and I think you had the benefit of having Gates McFadden there, a highly recognizable character. As soon as you said her name, the crowd went nuts.  Dan Huot: Definitely, definitely helped. And we had -- I don't know if we ever got the final count, but it was a couple hundred, but I mean that was at a big public event.  Gary Jordan: Yeah.  Dan Huot: That wasn't just a kind of NASA employees thing, that was at Comicpalooza here in Houston, so you could had a captive audience of thousands of people in a giant convention center who were crazy about comic books, and sci-fi, and science, and things like that, so we picked a pretty good spot to go do a great big live one.  Pat Ryan: They put us in a room where they said seated 1,500 people and it was half full.  Dan Huot: Yeah.  Pat Ryan: So, there was a good 7-8 hundred people  Dan Huot: We went on right after Wilmer Valderrama.  Pat Ryan: That's right.  Dan Huot: Which was really -- it was really cool to see him. He was talking about '70 Show and stuff like that, but we went on right after and that was -- that was just an incredible panel of people. You had Gates McFadden, who -- accomplished actor directors, done choreography, a million different things, and was on Star Trek, you know, one of the most iconic sci-fi series. You had Serena Auñón-Chancellor, NASA astronaut, who was just on board the space station, she's also a medical doctor and has done all kinds of insanely cool, and interesting, and unique things throughout her lifetime. And then we had two medical experts at NASA, one of which who's kind of on the leading edge. And one of the things that came up repeatedly during their introductions was none of these people only had one job in their life. Every single one of them was, you know, Gates, actor, director, choreographer, all these. Serena astronaut, doctor, and this guy was doctor, and he was a pilot in Canada for the Air Force Reserve. And then our final panelist was somebody who's been doing space to life sciences for astronauts since Apollo, so just the breadth of knowledge, the experience. And then I'm sitting there, like, hi, I'm Dan. [Laughter] I make funny videos sometimes.  Pat Ryan: Intimidated much?  Dan Huot: But then we had a couple of hundred people and it went fantastically, I mean it was in the middle of one of the Houston monsoons, so we all had fun getting into the center. I parked maybe five minutes away and then Ubered. A five-minute walk and then I Ubered because it was just pouring down rain, but it was a blast.  Gary Jordan: Wow, do you know what? I think -- I was sad to miss that one, but it sounded like a really good time. And I know just listening to it afterwards, I think what was great is that the panel was engaged with each other, they were sort of bouncing off -- and even Gates I think was really -- she was like genuinely curious.  Pat Ryan: She was asking some of the best questions.  Gary Jordan: Right, she was. She was doing great.  Dan Huot: She looked at me 2 minutes in and she's like, hey, can I ask questions? Is that okay? I was like, by all means. Go, make it so.  Gary Jordan: Alex, you've had your fair share of recording podcasts. I guess that was the first time you recorded that podcast outside of here.   Alex Perryman: Yeah.  Gary Jordan: But you've recorded an episode of Gravity Assist and you've talked to a bunch of people about recording the podcast, what's that been like?  Alex Perryman: It's been a blast. You know, working on Gravity Assist, I felt, you know, like I was cheating on our podcast because I was like, oh, how -- how can I do this? How can I record someone else's podcast? But it was a lot of fun.   Pat Ryan: Traitor.  Alex Perryman: I'm not a traitor. I came back.  Pat Ryan: You could’ve made a mistake.  [Laughter]  Alex Perryman: Well, no, it's been a blast doing it, and just talking to people who aren't in the NASA community about our podcast and seeing how excited they are about it. So, back in May, I went back to Full Sail University where I went to for their Hall of Fame week, and it's this huge week. This year was the 40th anniversary, and it was the 10th Hall of Fame, and I'm standing there looking at all these amazing people who have Oscars, and Emmys, and Grammys, and what they're doing, and I'm like, oh yeah, I'm the NASA girl here, but you know, I was still excited. And then I had one person walk up, his name is Gary Rizzo, and he just won an Oscar last year for his work for sound mixing on Dunkirk.   Gary Jordan: Oh cool.  Alex Perryman: And he walks in and he goes, hey, I wanted to talk to you about the podcast, I love it. And he started talking about his favorite episodes, and I'm like, what is going on here? I was like no way. Are we really talking about my podcast? I was like, well, I know another Gary who would be very happy to hear you say that.  Gary Jordan: I am very happy, that is awesome. That's really cool. Yeah. Yeah, so what's it like mixing the podcast? What do you tell people about how you actually do podcasting? I guess versus -- that versus like the other stuff you're doing for space.  Alex Perryman: Well, see, you know, it's really interesting because a lot of the people that I talk to when it comes to mixing, they're off into mixing music, whether it's -- mixing music live or mixing it, you know, for TV. And then they ask me, so how is it mixing at NASA and trying to do a podcast? And I was like you have to remember, mixing is mixing, whether you're singing or talking, right? So, some of the same tips. But our environment is a little bit more unique than others, and so I think that's what makes it more exciting and that's what gets people, you know, outside of our community -- our NASA community excited about what we're doing here is that it's like, wow, Alex is mixing, and there's astronauts on here, and there's -- she's talking to all these amazing people. I'm like, but you just did a show with a -- you know, a superstar.  Gary Jordan: Yeah.  Alex Perryman: A packed house and you want to talk about me doing a podcast that one of them I had to record in the closet.  Gary Jordan: Well, I think that's the best part is that we're reaching like different folks, you know? Like, just with Gates McFadden, right, we're reaching like the comicpalooza category, and with you, we're reaching like the audio engineer, like people who are in film, and wouldn't normally be exposed to like space -- spaceflight and stuff. Episode 68, we recorded with some headquarters folks, Bob Jacobs, Bill Barry, and Bert Ulrich. And at that time, they did a couple interviews at the Cape with people of the First Man.  Alex Perryman: Yes.  Pat Ryan: The cast members.  Gary Jordan: Yeah, the cast members, that's it, cast members, and crew, and director, and like all that. And we pulled those interviews in and got some -- got a little bit of Hollywood into the way that we're doing stuff.  [Transition Music]  Bob Jacobs: You know, they said, oh, we have these air conditioned tents, and I got into the first tent to interview Ryan and Claire and noticed that these huge tubes of AC were pointed at the actors.  Bill Barry: Not at the interviewers.  Bob Jacobs: The rest of us -- the rest of us had nothing.  Bill Barry: I had one of those tubes pointed at me, Bob, I was okay.  Bob Jacobs: And it was -- it was hot.  Bert Ulrich: It was horribly hot.  Bob Jacobs: You know, and it's hard enough talking to these people without sweating, so let's just add, you know, the Florida climate on top of it, and it was just a hot, miserable time, but everyone was really good about it.  [Transition Music]  Gary Jordan: I love kind of tackling all these different things and doing stuff a little bit differently. Pat, I feel like this is a good time to bring up the hero's podcast.  Pat Ryan: Master the segue.  Gary Jordan: That is right.  Dan Huot: On another note.  Gary Jordan: Yeah. We've been doing --  Pat Ryan: Meanwhile --  Gary Jordan: Series and -- and different audiences and stuff, this was just a completely different way of doing stuff. Tell me about the inception of this idea.  Pat Ryan: Credit for the start of it goes to that man in the corner, Greg Wiseman.   Gary Jordan: That’s right.  Pat Ryan: Say hi!  Greg Wisemen: Hello.  Gary Jordan: That’s right.  Pat Ryan: Greg is engineering this recording so Alex can sit up here, but Greg is another audio engineer here and he mentioned this story in a meeting that we had and I thought it would be real interesting. And it hit me as a fun thing to try to do. The story I thought was going to require talking to a number of people, not just one or two people, and that made me think of the podcast Serial, and I really liked that in the way that they talked to dozens of people and then find a way to weave those different interviews together in order to tell one story. I think that's really cool and I decided I wanted to try it. Why not? We can. So, Greg helped me contact all the people that had pulled off the trick of rescuing the audio from the Apollo 11 mission control center and set it up -- and set up interviews for all those people. Then the main character we referenced earlier as John Hansen, he's a University of Texas at Dallas professor, and an expert nationally in the field of speech recognition and speech technology. We went through that whole soap opera that we talked about a few minutes ago about finally getting it set and doing that interview with him. And I sat there with him -- we talked for about an hour and a half to try to get him to tell me the whole story of how he became aware that these tapes existed, and how they went through the process of getting them, and then trying to play them and finding out that they couldn't. There was only one machine in the world, apparently, that would have been capable of playing these tapes that contained 30 separate sources on each tape. It's a machine that's right here in this building but it didn't work, and they had to figure out how to make it work. And once they did, then they realized that they had no way to digitize those recordings and to do it in a way that would keep the recordings all linked to one another in time, in terms of when they happened in relationship to the other recordings that had happened. They went through and they finally figured all that out and it's been very successful research from an academic point of view. The National Science Foundation folks were -- crowed about it to us when we interviewed them. We talked to Hansen, we talked to a couple of his students that were involved in it, the National Science Foundation. Some people just out of history that had somehow dropped in on the story through Greg, as well as this long interview with Greg, and he's still getting fan mail from that.  Gary Jordan: All right.  Pat Ryan: Yay! Yay! Yay! So, it was fun, it turned out. I got to talk to -- we used eight different interviews. And oddly enough, the time when we finally -- when I finally got the time without anything else going on to be able to concentrate and pull the pieces together and write the script was during the furlough when civil servants were gone, contractors were still here, and we were allowed to do work on things that did not require direct supervision, wasn't much else going on, but there was that. And that was a task that was entirely up to me at that point, so I got to do it, and it took about a week. But I was able to knock out a script that we then -- with Greg's help, Greg and I were able to mold around and then and take all the interviews and find the pieces that fit together in order to tell the story and in a -- in a cogent fashion, and I think an interesting one. So, yeah, I had a great time doing it.  Gary Jordan: We've definitely had a lot of positive feedback from that whole series because it weaves -- like you said.  Alex Perryman: Yeah.  Gary Jordan: I think that style did the story itself justice because there are so many different elements to it. You're not just talking about restoring this ancient piece of hardware to actually play the tapes, but then there's this whole project to actually digitize them and then eventually do the research. But what NASA got out of it was digitized audio tapes that would have otherwise been sitting on the shelf for who knows how long, but it actually worked out.  Pat Ryan: Well, and two follow-ups on that, if you will, I did not listen to all 19,000 hours of the tapes in order to do this, but I think John Hansen did or pretty nearly. He listened to thousands of hours and when he talked about it with me, he was really -- I found really endearing in the way that he relayed just how cool this was to him to be able to hear all this stuff and to talk about some of the unusual things that he heard being said. One that I really liked was at one point in the conversation, he told me about the great surprise to him when he was listening to audio from Mission Control but heard television commercials from 1969 being played on there, including some for [gasp] cigarettes, it's almost the way he said it. And Greg and I thought that was pretty cool so we went and made a montage to provide listeners with examples of what TV advertising in 1969 sounded like.  [Transition Music]  John Hansen: So there's a lot going on. I will say that, when we first played some of the first tapes. What kind of surprised me, we picked up, I thought one that was probably PAO. And so I was a young kid at the time. But we actually picked up ABC, NBC or CBS news feed on these tapes. I didn't think that you would actually have heard that. And I heard some commercials that I remembered from 1969, you know, there. And I thought, well, this was kind of odd.  Pat Ryan: Breakfast cereals.  John Hansen: Yeah, yeah, exactly.  Pat Ryan: Dishwashing soap.  John Hansen: Smoking cigarettes.  Pat Ryan: Yeah.  John Hansen: They actually had advertisements for that.  Commercial 1: I'd walk a mile for a Camel.  Commercial 2:  If you don't buy RCA, you may be buying an obsolete color TV.  Commercial 3: [ Singing ] Take me along with you!  I love you little cutie but the office is my duty!  Commercial 4:  Featuring special savings on specially equipped Fury. Valiant. Barracuda. And Belvedere models.  Commercial 5:  When you’re out of Schlitz, you're out of beer.  [Transition Music]  Pat Ryan: And we played that back and that appeared in the episode and it was great, and it was fun. And it was -- that's another example I think of the fun we were able to have with it and not take ourselves too seriously, sometimes NASA does, but we tried not to. I was working through the script in the second Episode and we got to a section where we were talking about how to rehabilitate the sound scriber, this great big machine that, at that point, didn't work, but had to work in order for their thing to be pulled off. I realized that Greg and another guest, Larry Vrooman kept repeating a technical term, we got to do something in order to explain to the listener what that means. I got an idea about how to do it and I said, okay, why not? Just do it.  [Transition Music]  Larry Vrooman: And I tripped over an article in there about Greg. They had interviewed Greg about his project. And back at that time, he was struggling with, for example, the pinch roller.  Pat Ryan: Wait a minute, there's that phrase again. He was struggling with the what?  Larry Vrooman: Pinch roller.  Pat Ryan: I feel compelled to pause here. What is a pinch roller? And why does it matter?  Larry Vrooman: Well, the rubber is a compliant tacky surface. And the capstan, the metal machine, the capstan is not. So the capstan is rotated at a speed that the surface contact with the tape achieves the desired tape speed. And then the pinch roller simply ensures intimate contact. And the pinch roller actually does the pulling of the tape.  [Transition Music]  Pat Ryan: And after I let Larry finish explaining what a pinch roller was, we resumed. I went back to, and now on with the countdown. We'd conveyed the information that we wanted to, we had fun at it. And then later on when people said pinch roller, we added ding, so we had -- we had a good time.  Alex Perryman: I like that.  Gary Jordan: I like listening to that one.  Alex Perryman: Yeah.  Dan Huot: I mean I would just kind of pile on top, if you haven't gone through, go listen to that series just because it's almost like a national treasure story to me. It's -- when you talk about Apollo and everybody's going to hear about it every single day for the next two months, it's this event that -- it's this crowning achievement in human history and as such, it's just been studied, and dissected, and talked about ad nauseam for 50 years. So, when you find something that has just kind of been unearthed, this hidden treasure and then you get to tell the whole story of how this monumental undertaking just to make it so the entire world can enjoy it, that's really cool, and that's not something that we get to do very often.  Pat Ryan: No. And in this case, what we all -- in the process of doing that, we all -- we unearthed another aspect of those tapes that applied to actually another one of our episodes, the recent episode about the restoration of the Apollo Era Mission Control Room. Greg had explained to me that those Mission Control tapes from Apollo 11, the speech in them was understandable when they started playing it, but it wasn't clear, it had what's called wow and flutter. Alex, you know.  Alex Perryman: Yes.  Pat Ryan: That's just -- it's just distortions, right?  Alex Perryman: Right.   Pat Ryan: And the speech was understandable. Anyways, out in the world, there's a guy named Ben Feist who had worked with Apollo audio in the past, he had his own website where he posted all of the audio from Apollo 17, from the last mission to the moon. But he became aware of John Hansen's research and got together with an audio engineer from Europe and they wrote a computer program to correct those errors in the sound of the tape. They broke it down -- I had to ask him this question three times before I could really understand it. They broke down the audio from the Apollo 11 Mission Control Center into sections that the computer could look at and make corrections based on a reference from a timecode signal. They broke it down into 11 -- I'm sorry 8,000 frames per second.  Alex Perryman: Wow.  Pat Ryan: And corrected each of those frames, 8,000 of them per second for the whole however many thousands of hours it was in -- just for Apollo 11 to compensate for the wow and the flutter, that audio was used in John Hansen's project. It's the audio that we used in the podcast, and it's also being used in the actual restoration of the Apollo flight control room. Visitors to go in there in the future are going to be presented with a -- you know, as if you're sitting there really during the mission and the audio that they're going to hear is the audio that Ben Feist and this other guy fixed, if you will, so that it sounds like people were sitting in the room right now, it's -- it's amazing.  Gary Jordan: Yeah, I love that, that whole -- that whole thing. And you can check them all out at exploreApollo.org.  Pat Ryan: ExploreApollo.org.   Gary Jordan: That's right and that's where you can -- you can hear everything. And how all of it is being used in different products, I love that story so much. And I love the fact that we're going back and doing more Apollo stuff. Norah put together a cool page on all of the Apollo content that we're doing. One of my favorites actually was when we did Apollo 8, that one was actually -- there was a gap between part 1 and part 2 because like Pat was saying, that was that time where civil servants were on a shutdown and some of us couldn't work, so we couldn't post the podcast. But Apollo 8, I specifically remember, it was -- I guess more than two years ago at this point, I flew out to Billings, Montana to go interview Frank Borman, but it was for Apollo 1 at the time that was passing the 50th anniversary back in 2017. And when I was there, I got to record some -- an interview with him that was actually put together with a series of people because we didn't actually have the resources to go out and send a whole crew out to interview, so it was just me doing the whole thing, but I remembered that and pulled it for the Apollo 8 Episode, which we recorded with Jennifer Ross-Nazzal, who I'm happy to have on here soon again and for -- for the Apollo 1 actual event that we did and we pulled that from the archives as well. And that's what I think is cool about doing this podcast, as you were saying, you know, we have this format, why not try new things? Let's try the series. We've been doing the live episodes on stage. Dan, you did the one at Comicpalooza. We did them on stage here a couple times. We took panels that were not podcast but would otherwise be cool content anyway and turned them into a podcast, we're just trying different things and I like that. I think one of my favorites though was Shinedown.  Alex Perryman: That was awesome.  Gary Jordan: That was really cool. Thanks to Jeannie Aquino and Leah Cheshire for that one because that -- we all pulled that together. That -- I think we were trying to get Shinedown here, but just the timing didn't work out, but it was still a good conversation that we wanted to have about mental health and it's a topic that is often unexplored, I think, something we don't normally talk about.  [Transition Music]  Mark Vande Hei: But there was times when, on a Saturday morning, I might be feeling a little worn out. And I would just be there. I had a laptop in there. I'd start watching a movie. And that was a nice way to just decompress.  Gary Jordan: Just time by yourself. But you had the weekends. Guys, I don't think you have weekends when you're touring.  Eric Bass: We generally have, you know, 2 shows on, 1 day off, 3 shows on, 1 day off, 2 shows on, 1 day off. Occasionally, we just got done with 2 days off in a row, which never happens. Which we really enjoyed.  Brent Smith: But we can go get a hamburger.  [Laughter]  Eric Bass: We can go get a hamburger. And we’re—right, yeah.  Brent Smith: We can’t—we're not up there.  Eric Bass: Actually, I have a question for both Mark, I think it's for both Mark and Dr. Jim, there. You can both probably chime in on this. So, for me, one of the issues that I have being on tour is my hobbies. So, my hobbies that I love to do, and the things I love to do, really aren't conducive to being on tour.  [Transition Music]  Gary Jordan: So, I was really happy to have those guys on and really open up. And I think what's great about that one is after that podcast ended the guests I had there in the studio, Mark Vande Hei and Jim Picano paused for a second and they kind of are like, wow, thank you for letting me be a part of that. They're like, I didn't expect it -- I don't know what they expected, but they were, like I didn't expect it to go that way, and thank you for having me be a part of that, that was -- that was really, really cool. Guys, this is Episode 99, we're coming up on 100 next.  Pat Ryan: What's next?  Gary Jordan: What's next? Pat, what are we doing for Episode 100? What is the -- what's coming up?  Pat Ryan: Truth of the matter is we're still figuring out the exact composition of what the episodes 100 and 101 will be about, but they are both around the 50th anniversary of the first moon landing -- of the first humans to land on the moon. We have got -- we've got a historical discussion in -- in the plans. We have another interview with the NASA Administrator to talk not only about the past but probably a good bit about the future. I think that that's probably what Mr. Bridenstine wants to talk about mostly. We are also in the midst of producing a second episode in which the voices of the people who are leading the human space exploration effort today talk about how Apollo 11 influenced them in their current careers and their thoughts about what we're going to do next, about returning to the moon slash going forward to the moon in just the next few years, and then going beyond the moon and going to Mars, and God, who knows where else? We've talked to some folks from headquarters and a lot of people from here in Houston, since Johnson Space Center is the home of human spaceflight in America, thank you very much, that -- we're going to have those two episodes on July 12th and 19th in recognition of the big anniversary.  Gary Jordan: All right, a lot of great stuff coming up. I think what -- again, I'm going to reiterate one of the best parts about doing this is we get to try new things and explore new themes. We've done a bunch of -- we've done series, we've done live episodes, we've done video episodes, we've done episodes from space. That was fun when we did that back in like Episode 6.  Dan Huot: Yeah, that was fun.  Alex Perryman: Yep.  Gary Jordan: And we've recorded panels.  Pat Ryan: You know what we haven't done?  Gary Jordan: What haven't we done?  Pat Ryan: A musical.  Alex Perryman: A musical?  Gary Jordan: Dan, how's your -- how's your singing voice?  Dan Huot: Ha ha ha. So – that’ll be the end of the podcast, though right? We'll are on board with that?  Gary Jordan: Okay, we'll go out with a bang.  Dan Huot: Go out with something.  Gary Jordan: Yeah, but honestly, I do like checking out some of the reviews that we get, it's mostly positive and I think we've sort of tweaked the way that we do things and try new things along the way. But if you have a suggestion for the podcast, please make sure to say so, #askNASA, leave a review somewhere between I think five and five stars is the best place to rate this podcast and provide any suggestions on what we should do or what we're doing well and what we're doing not well, the more reviews, the better. We absolutely love doing this. If you want to hear more Pat, because Pat has been hosting a lot more. And --or if you want to hear more Dan because Dan has been hosting a lot less.  Dan Huot: Yeah, I'm realizing that as I got through this. I’m like man.  Gary Jordan: The idea was to phase you out but we had you here.  Dan Huot: I can take a hint.   [Laughter]  Gary Jordan: Yeah and special thanks to you, the listener, the reason that this has gone on for two years is because we've been receiving great feedback from you so far that this is an important thing to do so we will continue to do it. So, thank you so much for listening and downloading and please let us know if you have any more suggestions. I have a cake here that says Houston, We Have Another podcast, let's dig in, guys.  Alex Perryman: Yes.  Gary Jordan: Here's to another year.  Pat Ryan: Yay.  [ Applause and Cheers ]  [ Music ]  Gary Jordan: Hey, thanks for sticking around. I hope you enjoyed us reminiscing here on what we've done the past year. It's been a great ride and I really hope we continue this for as long as possible. Again, please leave us a great review, or any kind of critical reviews if you want us to do something a little bit different, or explore more series, or more live stuff, whatever you want, it would really help us to think about what we're going to be doing and what we're going to focus on in the future. Nasa.gov/podcast is where you can go to find all of the NASA podcasts, we're just one of them, otherwise, you can just come to our site, nasa.gov/Johnson/HWHAP, as in Houston, We Have a Podcast.

And if you haven't yet, check out NASA's newest podcast called NASA Explorers Apollo from NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center for all of your Apollo 11 50th needs. We'll leave you with this quick teaser.  [ Music ]  Narrator: July 20th, 1969, the day that changed our place in space forever.  Radio Voice: The Moon is there, in all its splendor.  Narrator: When Neil Armstrong took his small step and our giant leap, the whole world was watching.  Voice 1: You know, it was kind of like hard to believe that this was really happening in front of our eyes.  Voice 2: I remember that my parents were huddled around the television.  Radio Voice: We have a liftoff. 32 minutes past the hour. Liftoff on Apollo 11.  Narrator: Coming soon, NASA Explorers Apollo is a special NASA audio series that tells lesser-known stories behind the missions that took humans to the moon. We examine the things you might not have considered and asked questions like, what are we still learning about our Moon? What happened to the lost data of the Apollo Era? And how are we now preparing to go back? This summer, you can listen to NASA Explorers on Apple podcast, SoundCloud, and Google Play. Until then, you can help NASA tell the story of Apollo by sending us your memories. Visit nasa.gov/ApolloStories to learn more."

                        "description": "Gary Jordan (Host):  Houston, we have a podcast.  Welcome to the official podcast of the NASA Johnson Space Center, Episode 58, Isolation.  This is Part Two of our five-part series on the hazards of human space flight.  I'm Gary Jordan, and I'll be your host today.  On this podcast we bring in the experts, NASA Scientists, Engineers, and Astronauts, all to let you know the coolest information about what's going on right here at NASA.  So today we consider another hazard of human space flight, isolation and confinement.  We're talking with Tom Williams, Element Scientist for the Human Factors and Behavioral Performance in the Human Research Program.  He focuses on areas like habitability and behavioral health and performance risks to space flight in addition to many other areas.  He leads a research team that looks into the hazards of human space flight including isolation.  So with no further delay, let's go lightspeed and jump right ahead to our talk with Dr. Tom Williams.  Enjoy.     [ Music ]    Host: Okay, Tom.  Thank you for coming here today to talk about the second of our five hazards.  This one's on isolation.  I appreciate your coming on.    Dr. Tom Williams: Very glad to be here.  Thank you.    Host: So this one, this one's interesting.  And this one is a lot of -- when I think of isolation I think of a lot of songs, you know, like David Bowie.  You think of Space Odyssey , right?  Out there alone in the universe.  What am I doing?  But this is an interesting -- it's an interesting concept because I don't know if there's any place on Earth where you can be potentially as far away from Earth as you are with exploration and space travel.  It's a huge consideration.  So just sort of going through the isolation.  What is isolation and what have -- what do we know so far about what isolation does to the human body?  What do we know?    Dr. Tom Williams: Yeah.  So when we think of isolation, it's probably important to think about what in essence it does to us as human beings because we're very adaptive organisms.  I mean we're very resistant and adaptable to different changes in our environment.  And what isolation does is sort of remove that context of adaption because, when we're isolated, we're not being able to engage our environment in as many different ways as we are when we're not isolated.  And so, therefore, some of the things that we depend on to help us adapt to the different challenges that we may encounter are now removed from that.  So it sort of creates that barrier to allow us to kind of be that adaptive resilient human being that we know we can be.  So it's good to think of isolation as sort of three different areas.  There's a social disconnection because when you're isolated you're not around other people.  It also challenges our ability to self-regulate because we typically learn to respond to our environment by the manner in which other people may react to us.   And so there's an important component to that.  And then long-term, our mental representations of how we interact with our environment are often determined by how well we feel we're being successful in interacting with our environment.  So in an isolated environment, you're in a monotonous area, in an area, an environment that doesn't give us kind of that challenge and that feedback on how things are different each day and how we get to adapt to those differences.    Host: Yeah.  So there's no room for correction because nothing is correcting you.  So you're [inaudible], you can sort of spiral into any direction, really, without any sort of guidance.    Dr. Tom Williams: Yeah, it's a great point because oftentimes we like to think about the fact that, well, we wish we had less demand in our environment, but then when you get less demand in your environment it's not as interesting and we don't get to basically see how far we can go with some of the demands and challenges that we have in life.  And if you think about what we ask a crew -- we tend to look for really high-achieving, high-performing individuals who are used to taking on significant challenge, and then you put him in an isolated and confined environment where there's fewer demands placed on them.  They may be more extreme, but fewer demands over time in a long-duration mission, for example.    Host: So it kind of sounds like these fewer demands are almost kind of leading you -- if I'm in an isolated environment, it almost would want me to -- it's almost like I'm bored, right?  And so there's not as much demand on me, not as much feedback, so because I'm not getting that response, I create a more maybe exciting environment.  Maybe that's why the behavior -- is that a reason for it?  Has there been studies on that?    Dr. Tom Williams: Well, you know, when you look at some of those social deprivation, kind of the sensory deprivation experiments that were done in the '60s where they put individuals in a completely isolated chamber, removing all sensory stimulation.  So they're in a tank of water, no light, no sound, and people can't last in that environment very long.  And they started to have vivid imaginations, vivid like almost hallucinations.  The mind wants to be engaged.  The mind wants to be experiencing different stimuli, so it is important to keep that constant interplay between what's inside us and what's going on outside us, and to get feedback on how effective we're being.  And so I think that's part of that consideration for how do we make sure that we keep crew focused, engaged in meaningful and relevant activities so that they feel as though they're being successful on a long-duration mission where there may be fewer things to do.    Host: So is that some of the results that come from these studies in the '60s?  You realize that there needs to be some sort of stimulus, so you give them activities to do, but they have to be maybe a kind of specific activity to make sure that they are stimulated.    Dr. Tom Williams: Yeah.  One of the things we saw -- Shannon Lucid, when she was on Mir Station, one of the things she emphasized was the need to stay engaged in something that you enjoy doing because you would have periods of time.  So one of the things she did that was really fascinating is she took 100 books with her to read to her children.  So she recorded these books.  Now the problem, of course, on a long-duration mission, we may not be able to have the -- can't afford the weight that would be required to take large numbers of books.    Host: Right.    Dr. Tom Williams: We'd have to do it electronically or something of that nature.  But that shows you where she was proactively thinking ahead about if you're going to have periods of time where you're not going to have something to do, really high-achieving, engaged people will find something.  And so being planful about those type of demands helps you be prepared for it.    Host: See, in that instance, you have to be engaged, but not just with yourself.  It sounds like she was connecting to the ground.  She was down-looking to the ground to connect with another person.  So she's planning ahead, not just to stimulate herself, but to connect, to be with other people, and to have that sort of communication.    Dr. Tom Williams: Exactly.  Exactly.  And that's an important observation because that's what we need to characterize and understand.  And we know on station today, crew can, when they have time, and they're kept very busy on the station obviously every day with Sundays they attempted to give them off-time.    Host: Right.    Dr. Tom Williams: But they can do a connection straight down to their family on a voice-over-internet telephone, satellite phone, and so they can facetime as well.  So that's an important connection.  What we have to think about is how will that differ?  What impact will that have when there's a time delay --    Host: Oh, yeah.    Dr. Tom Williams: -- and you can't have that instantaneous feedback, that social connection that we know is important for human being.    Host: Yeah.  Definitely, once you go farther away from Earth, it's going to be harder to communicate.  So I want to jump away for just a few minutes to share this clip from my talk with Dr. Mike Barratt, a space traveler himself, and a medical doctor who has had experience with communicating with Earth from space, but reflected on continuing communication out into deep space.    Host:  Well, we'll start with this.  We'll start with -- is there a certain level of communication that's needed to maintain the crew's health and feeling like they're still connected and not so far away from Earth?    Mike Barratt:   I think that as we move towards exploration of deep space we have to actually look backward, not forward, for the answers to some of these problems.  Now, if you were to look at what I consider one of the greatest voyages of discovery of all time, Captain Cook's circumnavigation aboard Endeavor, where they were lucky to find a merchant ship or a whale ship that might be going to their home port maybe years into their voyage.  The crew would draft some letters, hand that to them, and hope that the ship would make it there safely sometime in the next year.  And that's -- that letter-writing campaign was kind of how things were done.  If you were to tell them, hey, look, we got a system where, given a few minutes to several hours, you can get a message back to Greenwich and then they can communicate with you before the day is out, they wouldn't have believed you.  So, basically, what we have is a revolutionary capability compared to the means that supported exploration missions for centuries.   And so, can we do it?  If course.  We have.  We can do that.  Now we have to crew and we have to design accordingly, and really move towards more mission autonomy.  And we've spoiled ourselves in a way by having such broad bandwidth and real-time communication for the station.  But the station is a laboratory, and it is designed to produce as much science as possible, and that really depends on real-time communication.  Whereas heading to Mars and some of the other deep space destinations, we're not in that paradigm.  We are really all about exploring and what we need to do in maintaining the ship and maintaining the crew and supporting the mission.  Most of the responsibility has to really be given to the crew.    Host: And that's a big one, right?  The Space Station -- there's -- it's pretty close to no delay whenever you're talking, and that's why you can have back-and-forth real-time communication with the ground.  But as you go further out into space, now that signal is taking extra time to travel back and from Earth and Mars.  Depending on where the Mars and Earth are positioned in the solar system, it can be up to a 40-minute roundtrip, right?  Twenty minutes out, 20 minutes back.    Dr. Tom Williams: Right.    Host: So are we planning for that?  Are we making sure that communication, even if it is delayed, is a regular part of living on another planet?    Dr. Tom Williams: We are.  And part of what we're looking at is more autonomous systems that allow for the individual to be able to carry out the activities without the constant interplay between Mission Control and ground on getting feedback.  So some of the things that starts to help us anticipate is if there are training requirements that - do we need to train crew differently if there's no Mission Control that they can reach back to to make the procedure they're about to engage in is the right sequence of procedures.  So part of our research program looks at how do we make sure that procedures are sequenced in the right way to ensure that they're efficient and effective so that we don't add stress in that way.  Another thing that we're looking at is, how do we determine if your schedule needs to be changed?  So now the crew schedule with slight modifications by them is basically handled by ground, so Mission Control will determine what the schedule will be for the day.   On an autonomous mission, more autonomous, where there's less interplay, how will the crew determine if they want to change their schedule and what might that schedule change -- what's the impact of that over time?  So maybe they don't want to do something at that particular time that it was scheduled, and they put that off.  Well, what's the impact of putting that off and how does it then alter other sequence activities that would need to follow?    Host: Yeah.    Dr. Tom Williams: And those are important things we want to look at.    Host: Because if they get -- if they put it off, they're not going to get feedback that says hey, don't put that off for, you know, it depends, up to 20 minutes.  Somebody recognizes that they're getting -- or maybe 20/40 minutes -- recognizes that they're putting it off.  Hey, you weren't supposed to do that.  But by the time they get the feedback it's already gone.    Dr. Tom Williams: Right.    Host: So that's where that level of autonomy comes from.  So -- and that's part of regular life on station, too, right, is having that feedback.  Is -- I know the astronauts are so busy just day to day.  I mean, they have scientific experiments that they're running constantly throughout the day.  They got to maintain the Space Station, too.  So if something breaks, they got to fix it.  And then on top of that, they have to work out.  Is a lot of these tasks -- I mean, is there anything in addition to that to make sure that they are receiving this sort of stimulus and making sure that they don't feel isolated?  Where does isolation come into their day to day?    Dr. Tom Williams: I'd say the isolation is more -- because there's great social cohesiveness that exists on station among the crew.    Host: Right.    Dr. Tom Williams: So with the number that they tend to have there, there is that sense of connection with the crew.  And that strengthens over time.  But what's interesting is you'll -- you sometimes will note that crew, as the mission goes on, will tend to spend more time taking pictures and looking at Earth through the cupola.  So do we infer from that that they're missing that social connection on Earth, because one of the things we see when crew come back is sort of an increase and a sense of universalism, so they have an expanded view of the world, and part of that is probably because they've been able to see it from a distance as opposed to just on Earth as we all see it.  And the other thing that we can conjecture on that is that if they're looking more at Earth, is it because they're getting closer to their mission ending?  Or is it because they miss the people on Earth more as time goes on?   And so part of that psychological connection is part of what we need to understand as we look at some of our high fidelity analogs to make a determination what are the processes that are causing the changes in behavior.  And we had one, for example, one study that we looked at, the results of -- from -- that was run in Russia, the Mars 520.  And one of the things that was noted in the six crew members in that analog was that there seemed to be an increase in what we might call psychological [inaudible], so their energy levels were less as time went on.  So near the end of the mission they were less active, and was that less activeness as a result of being disconnected from the outside world more, was it a function of having less stimulation from their environment?  And those are things that when we see these results then we need to ensure that we characterize them appropriately to see was this a function of the individuals within that analog, or does it generalize out to potentially our crew, and then we need to better understand that.    Host: I know, I know.  Why are you cutting away from the conversation, Gary?  This is the last one, I promise.  But who better to comment on do you feel isolated than an astronaut himself.  Here's Mike Barratt once again.    Host:  Did you ever feel isolated on a Space Station or maybe because it's so close that maybe you felt pretty connected?    Mike Barratt:    I think that the only times I ever felt isolated up there was when I knew there were events going on on the ground that I really wanted to be a part of.  Mostly family events.  Other than that, not really, for two reasons.  You know, number one, all those habitability factors that I mentioned.    Host: Yeah.    Mike Barratt:    But number two, where you are is just so magical.  I mean, it captivates you.  You are mostly feeling how amazing it is to be where you are and feel what you're feeling and see what you're seeing than you are wishing that you were elsewhere.    Host: So I'm guessing there's a lot of studies, really, or maybe a few, at least, that are looking at behavioral changes on long-duration missions because that's what we're doing now.  Crews that are going to the Space Station are up there for up to six months.  So are you already looking at behavioral changes, especially in performance and how well and how efficiently they're doing their tasks, from beginning to the end of the mission?    Dr. Tom Williams: We are indeed.  We have a number of different analogs that we look at.  In fact, we just had the human exploration research analog, the HERA Mission that just ended this past Monday night.    Host: Oh, that's right.    Dr. Tom Williams: And we've had crew in there for 45 days, and what we look at, across that 45 days -- of course we do a baseline -- but then across the 45 days we're looking at potential changes in cognitive processing.  So we have them engage in a number of tasks that are space-flight-relevant.  But we're also assessing using a cognition battery that was developed specifically for astronauts because of the different impacts that we think space may have, space flight may have on the cognitive processing.  So we're looking at that across time.  We're looking at their team interactions across time, how that may change their cohesiveness, their sense of cooperation and collaboration with one another, and we're looking at how they eat, how they sleep, and with the crew that we just finished with, we also had them on a sleep-restricted schedule to determine what was the impact of that, and there are a number of different factors that we look at and then we consolidate that information, recognizing we brought four people in to do a task.   What is the impact when we give them structured tasks to do and then how does that change the way they relate to one another, the way that their mind and body starts to adapt to this demand?  And then we'll use that to generalize to what do we need to prepare for countermeasures for any of those factors that we think are impacting them.    Host: HERA is very interesting because it's just this habitat really that simulates like this is probably sort of what a Mars habitat, a lunar habitat, whatever, and other planetary habitat would look like.  And it's just living and working in this habitat.  But the reason you're doing it is exactly what you're saying, it's to study these behavioral changes.  You do these tasks and see how they react to that.  Obviously, you know, astronauts are going to be there and they're going to be working hard just like they do on the Space Station.  But whenever -- there's going to be times, there's going to be times where they're going to have so much work that they're going to be sleep-deprived.  So exactly what happens to that?  Is there comparisons we can draw?  Do you see a lot of the same things happening with the workload and the behavioral changes on the station and in HERA?  Is there a lot of crossover there?    Dr. Tom Williams: You know we've had some great researchers, Chuck Czeisler and Laura Barger and then Erin Flynn-Evans of our own NASA Ames Research Center that have looked at using actigraphy which is an indirect measure of sleep.  So when we sleep we tend to not be moving around, hopefully.  And so the actigraphy device measures how much activity the individual is engaged in, and then from that we infer the person is sleeping or not.  And in one study that they looked at in 21 crew, they found that about 29% of the time crew aren't sleeping well.  Their circadian rhythm has been dysregulated.    Host: Wow.    Dr. Tom Williams: And that can be due to a slam shift, for example.  There was a docking with a resupply vehicle or a Soyuz craft that comes in in the middle of the night where they normally would have been sleeping which then, because of the schedule, they're don't really get to catch up on their sleep.  They can't sleep in the next day because of activities or requirements.  And so -- and the research tells us that it takes about 13 hours of sleep to sort of recover after your circadian has been dysregulated, so you'll need to get extra sleep.  But we tend to see that, although it's very individual, crew will tend to average about six hours of sleep at night on station.  Now we know that's not what they need because when we measure the sleep before they go up and when they come back, they're averaging about seven hours of sleep.  So it could be a function of high workload.  It could be a function of just circadian dysregulation because of the 16 sunrises and sunsets that they observe each day.   And for here on Earth, our sleep cycle and our circadian is regulated by the sun rising and setting for us.  That's what signals us to be on that cycle.  So it's understandable if they're getting that exposure that they're now -- that's part of that challenge to the adaptation that we started talking about.  The body is incredibly adaptive as we learn if we fly to a new time zone.  In about two to three days we can adapt to that new time zone.  But 16 new time zones a day makes it more challenging [inaudible] adaptive.    Host: That's right.  You can almost call the Station the time zone of its own.  You know, there's very -- there's no places, there's no few places, there's no places on Earth where the sun rises 16 times in a single day --    Dr. Tom Williams: Right.    Host: -- in a 24-hour cycle.  But that's interesting.  You know, I'm glad you guys aren't studying me because I would be all over the place, and I like my blackout curtains, so, you know, the sun rising and sunsets does not have any impact on me.  But are you guys questioning the crew?  Are you -- you know, when you're trying to understand why they're getting less sleep, do you -- do they give you feedback?  It's because maybe at the end of the day I'm so exhausted from a day, I just want to look out the window for a little bit, and I'm kind of going into my sleep time, and to just, to look at the window, and just sort of relax for a bit.  Are they doing stuff like that?    Dr. Tom Williams: Yes.  So the crew have been debriefed, and among the reasons that they cite and in particular a good reason to have private sleeping quarters on station or on a craft, one of the reason is they may get disturbed by another crew member who gets up to go to the bathroom at night, much like married couples might experience if someone's making noise.  That noise is now causing the person to stir.  Other activities might be noise or an alarm that goes off that needs to be attended to.  And the sleep cycle itself may be interfered with by just the intense workload.  So we know that stress and the demands that are placed upon us during the day will cause the sleep architecture to shift and then make us more vulnerable to being awakened, and some of that goes back to the evolutionary time where in our evolutionary past those humans that were more alert to potential danger in the middle of the night were the ones who passed their genes on later.   Those who slept deeply through the fact that a saber-toothed tiger may be coming in the cave that they were sleeping in, they tended not to survive.    Host: Yeah.  Natural selection and -- yeah.  It -- you're not going to survive a saber-toothed tiger for sure.  Now we're talking about some studies to recognize these behaviors, to understand what is happening and why it's happening.  Are we also looking into these countermeasures to see -- we understand a little bit of what's happening and we've come up with these methods on how to maximize crew performance.    Dr. Tom Williams: Yeah.  We've looked at a number of different countermeasures, some of which are sleeping medications.  So, for example --    Host: Oh.    Dr. Tom Williams: -- looking at what is the best dosage level of a sleep aid that allows you to wake up in the middle of the night and respond to an emergency situation.  So that was one great research project that was done that basically allowed us to then determine if someone is awakened by an alarm, how responsive can they be on which dosage level so that we ensure that we've got the right dose and the right medication so that, although we want you to sleep, we don't want you to sleep through an alarm that may have needed your action to save the process that was now being threatened that the alarm was alerting you to.  So that's one approach as a countermeasure.  The other is to teach some of the good classic [inaudible] behavioral skills that allow you to self-regulate, that allow you to be able to go through a series of relaxation processes, being mindful about what are the things that are stressing you and then self-regulate those in such a way that the stress levels don't raise as high as they would have without that, that then helps modulate some of that reaction to stress that would rob us of our sleep.   So a number -- and then other factors are to basically look at what within your private crew quarter area, for example the lighting system, just like on our iPhones, we can adjust the settings to ensure that we're not getting that bright blue light at night that would stimulate our awakening, we've changed the lighting around the private crew quarters on station.  And we have a lighting effects study going on now that's looking at as these lights are adjusted, does that have an impact on the sleep cycle of the crew members?    Host: You know, after learning about that, that lighting effects study, I purposely downloaded a blue light filter, so that way, if I'm looking at my phone at night, it get's that warm screen because I recognized that that is something that really can affect your sleep and, therefore, your performance.  And that's actually a good bouncing off point is we're talking a lot about sleep and how it affects performance and behavior which is a huge part of isolation, too.  It seems like getting more sleep can maybe help with some of those feelings of isolation and behavior changes.  Is there a correlation there?    Dr. Tom Williams: Well, there's probably a happy balance that you get because sometimes when people are isolated they sleep more --    Host: Hmph.    Dr. Tom Williams: -- but they sleep more because they're becoming more depressed or they're becoming --    Host: Oh.    Dr. Tom Williams: -- because of that lack of engagement in their environment, there's fewer stimuli, they're becoming more bored, it's more monotonous, and people who are bored in a monotonous situation tend to doze off and tend to -- because of the lack of stimulation.  So there is unhappy balance that we have to find.  And we know that sleeping too much can be as bad as not sleeping enough.  So finding -- and the interesting thing is there are great individual differences that people have in terms of how much sleep they really need.  We pretty much know that almost every human being needs at least four hours of sleep at night just to maintain their ability to do things.    Host: Right.    Dr. Tom Williams: But when you're not getting that sort of optimal level, you're going to notice differences where they might have little periods of microsleep or doze off for just a moment.  They might not even be aware of it.  But the optimal is seven for most people.    Host: Hmm.  Four hours is just to survive.  Beyond that, that's where, you know, that's where the behavioral performance and making sure long-term health is maintained.  That seven is good.  You know, we're talking a lot about station and we're talking a lot about space flight and sleep.  I kind of want to take a step back and think about, you know, beyond space flight -- space flight is a great example of isolation because you're literally in a capsule far away from everything.  But it's not the only place where isolation can be studied.  Are we polling some studies and data from other instances of isolation?  Like where else could humans be isolated that we're getting this information?    Dr. Tom Williams: Well we certainly use our analogs a great deal.  We also look across at, for example, submarines, and we know that individuals will be out on a submarine for anywhere from six to nine months on occasion.  So what we get from that is what it's like to be isolated, but it's not a perfect analog for us because most of the crew on a submarine are much younger than our average age astronaut of about 42.  The crew on a submarine are going to be primarily much younger in that mid-20 range for most, and then you'll have a small contingent of maybe mid-30s.  And they have more variety, more recreation, more opportunities to interact because there's a larger number on a submarine than the small crew of four or six --    Host: Right.    Dr. Tom Williams: -- we might have.  And then when we look at, on an oil rig, for example, same thing.  We've got -- there are certain similarities -- they're isolated, they're sort of away from most of the social connection that might be there, and you tend to get high-achieving individuals who have -- they're working in an extreme environment, so they have to be vigilant and attentive, and there's stress and there's new technology that gets introduced, and so they have to be adaptable to those demands.  But, again, they -- and they will get some sleep cycle adjustments because of the shifts that they have to pull.  But what we find is that they're not the perfect match.  And so we take pieces of each of these analogs and these different groups and we put together into this sort of a mosaic that says we've got some understanding of what human beings are like in this environment, and we can generalize to this level.   And we get some in our high-fidelity analogs, and we get a little bigger understanding.  But the best analog is the Space Station itself because there we've got the full complement of adaptations that have to be considered and that is the altered gravity, the other for-space flight hazards that you're series is focused on.    Host: Right.    Dr. Tom Williams: All of those come together into the human.  We have to understand the full complement of how those may be impinging on each of those areas.  So is isolation in confinement much worse when you're in an altered gravity environment --    Host: Oh, yeah.    Dr. Tom Williams: -- at great distance from Earth?  And that's part of what we're looking at.  And some of our research is we're looking at when you have a stress condition in altered gravity that gets irradiated, is that worse than just being isolated, just being stressed, or just being irradiated?  So we've tended to focus more on the individual risk.  But we know our crew are going to experience in an integrated potentially synergistic way.  So how do we anticipate that?    Host: That's very interesting.  Yeah, it does make sense to just focus on one thing because that's not what the environment is.  The environment's going to throw at you altered gravity and radiation and all and being far away.  All these different hazards have to come together, and you have to make sure performance is maximized.  And you're not just, all right, we fixed the isolation thing.  Oh, yeah, what about radiation?  What about, you know, change in gravity, all those kinds of things?  So what element -- let's pick on oil rigs for a second.  What elements or oil rigs and the folks that work there are we looking at and taking to space flight and how we deal with isolation?    Dr. Tom Williams: Some of what we look at there is some of the occupational surveillance that gets done with oil rig workers.  So how does their sleep get interfered with by the demands of their schedule when they have sleep-shifting?  So just like we have on a slam shift on station when a Soyuz docking comes in.  If they have some event that occurs that alters their sleep, what's the sleep cycle changes that we see?  We also look at -- they tend to be sort of high-performing extreme environment individuals.  How do they handle the stress?  How do they -- and they're gone for periods of time and then reintegrate with the family.  So there's a multiple kind of context of different things that we can look at with them that help inform us about if they've got an effective countermeasure.  Then we look at how might we adapt that to our circumstance.    Host: Yeah, that's big.  I mean just -- you're not just going to let someone just go on an oil rig and say all right, 'bye, have fun.  It's the monitoring aspect that really helps you to understand what's going on throughout the whole time they're on an oil rig, and that -- and you translate that directly to a space flight.  That's why we're doing it.  That's why we're actually paying attention and monitoring these changes over time.  And that's a huge element that I think is important for astronauts, too, you know.  Astronauts -- I always look up to them because they're such amazing human beings, just physically, mentally, just unbelievable what they can endure.  And that's different from just me going out on an oil rig or up there because they are just superior human beings.  And I think that's having that as an element, as a factor for understanding isolation is pretty big.  You have to have high-performing individuals.  Sure, you as a researcher can control some things, but ultimately you've got to have the best of the best that are going out there.    Dr. Tom Williams: Agreed.  Which has been -- and we do make great efforts to make sure that individuals who apply fully understand what it is they're asking to be a part of --    Host: Right.    Dr. Tom Williams: -- and then they go through a very demanding process to make sure that they reflect those characteristics that are going to position them for success, to be honest.  I mean, we want to select people who are going to be successful operating in the extreme environments that we're going to place them in.  And so there's great demands that will placed on him, great achievements that are possible.  How do we align the capabilities and aptitudes with those demands?  And that's part of what our selection process looks at.    Host: Mm-hmm.  You know, I just realized we've been talking a lot about we, we here at NASA, and we're talking about a big broad thing.  But you have a very extensive yourself.  So how did you officially come to NASA and what's your background in that led you to start studying isolation?    Dr. Tom Williams: So I have a PhD in Clinical Psychology from St. Louis University, and that was probably, in part, the foundation that helped me find myself here because of the great connection between the science and practice that the program offered there.  And part of what my background was was in running an executive health program for executive leaders and developing leader development strategies and approaches and 360 feedback tools for them.  And in 2009 I was asked to come and help with astronaut selection and found that really an exciting opportunity and decided if I ever had the opportunity I wanted to come and be a part of NASA's mission because of the importance of it, the strategic nature of it, and because of the contribution that it makes to our nation and to the world to be honest.  So I found the opportunity in a position that became available that someone here at NASA made me aware of that they felt I would be an appropriate person for that.   And I have not been disappointed in the opportunity.    Host: That's awesome.  You know, I didn't realize you were part of the selection process.  You know, thinking about it from your psychology background, and when you were looking at these individuals and maybe interviewing them, what about their personality qualities about them did you really look for to know that they were going to be able to handle the stresses of space flight and be able to handle isolation instance?    Dr. Tom Williams: Well, just like you might imagine.  You're looking for individuals who have demonstrated that they've been able to handle challenging experiences, challenging demanding occupational backgrounds, and shown an adaptability to these differing demands that we know we're going to place on them.  So it's the adaptability, it's the achievement orientation, it's the resiliency.  You don't have to be the perfect individual, but you have to be the individual that has demonstrated that you're able to learn from, adapt, and grow stronger as a result of the experiences that you've encountered and the demands or the different challenges that you've overcome.  So just like explorers of old, the people who planfully look at what has to happen, take steps to prepare themselves to do those adaptations, those demands, to meet those demands, are those individuals who are going to be successful.   And that's what we're looking for is -- you now, it's -- there's an old strategist, Colin Grey, who once said, \"We're always going to be surprised by different events.  We just can't afford to be catastrophically surprised.\"  And so what we want are individuals who allow us to avoid being catastrophically surprised.  So we want the right people with the right mix of skills, with the right abilities, who can handle those surprises that are going to come up that we can't anticipate and plan for every possible outcome.  But with the right, resourceful, adaptive individual, they can handle those situations and make sure that we achieve success.    Host: And you know because based on their resume, they have already handled that situation.  I know just in our 2017 class I believe either two or three, I believe, of the astronauts that were selected had Antarctic expeditions.  I just just in that small group.  So you know they're going to be able to handle a dangerous environment, a stressful environment.  And then that translates perfectly to long-duration space exploration.  And the further we go out, you know, they know they'll be able to handle themselves.  That experience goes miles.  So also thinking about the stuff that you've done, especially here at NASA, are there any studies here at NASA that you've done specifically that you've focused on or are related to isolation or psychology?    Dr. Tom Williams: Well, as the element scientist, I look across the portfolio of the different risks that we have basically responsibility for .    Host: Okay.    Dr. Tom Williams: So we're looking at nine of the 32 risks that are focused on reducing that risk that we need to have reduced in order to basically successfully go on a long-duration mission.  So my position identifies are are the research kind of lanes that need to be addressed, and working closely with the discipline scientist for each of those risks, then integrating and determining how best to meet those, either with a directed study, usually with a -- the default is always to go with a solicited study.  And we bring in some of the most premier researchers in the world and a lot that are focused on -- their expertise is really designed to help us characterize the risk, reduce the risk, or develop countermeasures once we've understood the risk.  And so we're very fortunate to have great researchers like -- you heard me mention Chuck Czeisler and Laura Barger on the sleep area.   David Dinges from the University of Pennsylvania and Matthias Bazner working with us closely to help identify what are the impacts of sleep and what are the cognitive changes that may accrue as a result of that.  So putting those studies, building a solicitation that helps us look out to say what are the ways in which these risk factors may interplay and how do we then design research to help us characterize the risk to ensure that we've got the appropriate understanding to prepare our crew appropriately or to develop countermeasures in case that risk gets realize in some way?    Host: So you're like a -- you're a big-picture guy.  You're looking at the whole landscape and then picking these studies.  So you're talking about nine of the 32 risks you said.  You said 32.  The 32 risks of what?  Of the human in space?    Dr. Tom Williams: Right.  So we have the five space flight hazards.    Host: Right.    Dr. Tom Williams: And then there are 32 risks that the Human Research Program has identified that we look at and know that there is some evidence that it may pose a risk to either crew health or performance, or to the mission.  And so our risks are then -- our job is to identify, well, what's the evidence that we have, and what's the gap, the research gap, the lack of understanding that we may have about that particular risk, and then how do we bring to bear an understanding that characterizes that risk, gives us a tool or technology that may help us counter it, and gives us a method to basically provide to the crew to help them reduce that risk.  So, for example, we talked about sleep as one of those risks.    Host: Mm-hmm.    Dr. Tom Williams: And then build -- basically take our capability to the extent that we've reduced the likelihood and consequence of that particular risk being realized on a mission.  And so that's our goal, is to bring scientific information to bear, and we're in an applied science program, so bring scientific evidence to bear that helps us then reduce that risk to an acceptable level.  Because of the extreme nature of space flight and just the hazards that are always going to be there, we can't run a mission without any risk.    Host: Okay.    Dr. Tom Williams: But how do we get it to an acceptable level so that we were able to successfully send and return a crew safely back to Earth?    Host: Mm-hmm.  Acceptable is a pretty subject sort of feeling, too, because what is acceptable?  What is -- what do you determine that you are comfortable with that amount of risk?  It sounds like maybe it has to do with knowledge.  You know, you've looked at the risk and you've asked a lot of questions, and answer a few of them, and understand the overall capabilities of the risk.  And maybe it's that understanding that allows you to determine that, yes, maybe this is an acceptable level that we've reached.  Is that kind of the process?    Dr. Tom Williams: It's a good description of it.  Basically what makes it acceptable is we're not going to lose crew, we're not going to harm them in some way, and we're going to have a successful mission.  So we want to get the percentage of risk down to a level that the leadership makes the determination this is now an acceptable level where we're not going to lose crew nor harm them in some way nor impact the likelihood of achieving the mission's success.  So that's what determines the acceptability.    Host: Okay.  So you talked about you're focusing on nine.  Sounds like sleep, just sleep is a category of its own, right?  Is sleep just a risk?  And then you have several studies that are looking just at that risk?  Is that how that works?    Dr. Tom Williams: Exactly.    Host: Okay.    Dr. Tom Williams: So with our sleep risk area, we have about eight different gaps that we have -- we know that we need to address.  Now sleep is one of those areas that we have probably characterized most of the risk to an acceptable level.    Host: Oh.    Dr. Tom Williams: So we know that -- we know how much sleep people need.  We know we don't get enough, and we know that we need strategies and countermeasures to address it when we don't get enough.  But some of the others are the behavioral risk factors.  So our behavioral medicine risk deals with when we're isolated and confined, what are the psychological processes that start to accrue that may potentially create a vulnerability to become depressed or anxious or to feel the lack of energy to get the job done that the crew needs to do?  And there have been little hints of that, that a crew both in analogs and sometimes on mission, you'll see evidence that something is causing a decrease in activity.  So the question is, does -- is that moving toward a condition that would concern us or is it just an adaptation that the person is making?   And we don't -- that's -- again, we don't want to be surprised in a long-duration mission by something happening.  So we want to look at that carefully, address the evidence that we have, and then develop a countermeasure in anticipation that that may happen.  So, therefore, deal with it ahead of it.    Host: Hmph.  Do you notice -- you know, thinking about this idea of maybe isolation, depression, and signs of it, maybe decreased performance and abilities to complete tasks.  You talked in the beginning of our discussion about looking out the window and how often they're doing that.  Are you monitoring how often they're doing it or for how long they're doing it?  Is that part of the study, to determine, oh, maybe this person might be feeling a little off today because they've been at the window for way longer than usual.    Dr. Tom Williams: We don't do that precisely.  We just note activity levels.  But one of the things we will monitor, for example, are journaling.  So --    Host: Ah.    Dr. Tom Williams: -- in the crew journal, and they do it anonymously, but we'll make note of how many references they may make to home or to family or to relationships, and to sleep.  So what -- when they're journaling and writing about their day, what are the types of things that draw their attention?  There's a famous study, sort of referred to as Aging With Grace where they took the letters that young women would write to enter a novitiate to become a nun.  And they could predict, based on the letter that was written in the early, late teens, early 20s, they could predict who was likely to have Alzheimer's with a high degree of predictability later in life by the nature of how open, how expressive, how many details they talked about in their life, how many things they had engaged in, was predictive as to who would get Alzheimer's later in life.   So when you take evidence like that and you say, when someone's journaling, how rich is the content?  What can we discern from the pattern of expressions?  And do they change over time?  So how did they start?  And how did they change over time?  Or did they stay consistent?  And you can use that to infer that there's been a change in the adaptability because they started a certain way.  What has now operated on this individual that has caused them to now change the approach?  And then we have to infer from that certain patterns that may give us insight into what may have been the reason for that change.    Host: Interesting.  I wouldn't have thought about that.  So for the nuns it was the more detail they gave, the less likely or the more --    Dr. Tom Williams: The less likely.    Host: The less likely.  So they were more vague.  You were talking they had a better chance of getting Alzheimer's when they were early.    Dr. Tom Williams: Yes.    Host: Wow.  All right.  I'm going to start journaling and taking detailed notes of every excruciating --    Dr. Tom Williams: Exactly.    Host: -- part of my life.    Dr. Tom Williams: Exactly.    Host: It's not going to be an interesting read but I do -- yeah.  I mean, that's an awful, awful disease.  But it's interesting that you can tell it that early just based on how much detail and how much recollection you have.    Dr. Tom Williams: And if you think about what we talked about in terms of just the human's ability to adapt, what that says is they've got lots of connections.  And when you relate it back to what we talked about in being isolated and confined, we're talking about removing lots of connections.  And so what we want to be alert to is how does the mind attempt to adapt to it's environment?  And someone who's more closed off, not as expressive, isn't engaging their environment as much as the person who's very open, engaging, seeking experiences.  And from that we need to learn and identify what are the strategies that we could bring that would help counter some of the potential impact of restricting those experiences?    Host: Hmm.  So I want to look ahead.  I want to jump ahead to a mission to the moon or to Mars, a long-duration stay.  From your perspective, what are the crew doing to maintain their behavioral performance, to make sure that they are performing and not feeling these feelings of isolation and confinement?  What is part of their daily lives that will help them to be successful on these missions?    Dr. Tom Williams: That's a really important point and question because part of what we know that helps off of us feel effective is if we have meaningful and relevant things to do each day.  So part of a mission planning will have to be meaningful activities that matter, that help them feel like they're making a contribution, because we're taking high-achieving, high-functioning individuals and we're going to put them on a mission.  And we got to make sure that we keep them engaged on activities that they feel are worthy of their time, that help them feel as though they're making the contribution to the overall success of the mission, and that also help them grow, that help make those connections like we were just referring to in terms of keeping the mind stimulated, to be challenging in some way, but not to the point where it frustrates, but to the point where the mind is engaged and growing, because that's what helps us adapt each day to our environment.   And so part of what we're looking at is what type of training might we do en route as opposed to filling all the time ahead of the mission and putting all the demands on the crew before they launch if we know there's going to be long periods of time where they're just transiting from Earth to, for example, Mars.  How do we take advantage of that time by giving them the training that's most appropriate and most timely for when they have to do the task?  So that's one of the approaches that we're taking with regard to that.    Host: That's right.  So they could potentially launch from the Earth going to a long destination far away and not have all the information already packed into their brain to be successful on that mission, knowing that you have, let's just call it six to nine-month journey to Mars.  That's six to nine months of learning that you can do, that you can be training and constantly engaging your brain to learn something new, not just a refresher, but something entirely new.  That's interesting.  I wouldn't have thought of that.    Dr. Tom Williams: And it's a combination because it is -- it's a refreshing because some things we may have trained them to do two years before launch.    Host: Ah.    Dr. Tom Williams: And so how do we identify which of the tasks that need to be refreshed?  Which are the ones that need to be learned new, that it would be okay to learn for the first time about a month before you need them?  And which of the tasks that were required that you may need during the mission, during that transit time, which -- when do you need which training at what sequence?  And so that's part of what we're trying to make a determination for.    Host: Interesting.  It's good to know that we're kind of approaching this, when we're talking about the five hazards, we're approaching it from all different angles.  And I love how you said they're all integrated, too.  You know, we're talking about isolation and we're focusing a little bit on that, but in all of these studies, you know, altered gravity and radiation and being far away, all of these things are very big considerations for how to be successful in anything that you're studying.  So, Tom, I appreciate you coming on today and sharing your perspective about this idea of isolation and confinement so we can go farther into the cosmos.    Dr. Tom Williams: Great.  Thank you very much for your interest and for your time and letting us share this with you.     [ Music and Inaudible Speakers ]    Host: Hey, thanks for sticking around.  So that was Dr. Tom Williams.  We talked about isolation today.  And that was part two of our five-part series on the Hazards of Human Space Flight.  If you have been listening to Houston, we have a podcast in order.  You already listened to our talk with Zarana Patel for Radiation.  That was part one.  And then next week we'll be talking about the Distance From Earth.  If you want to know more about the Hazards of Human Space Flight, you can go to NASA.gov/hrp.  This podcast series is -- we're working hand-in-hand with the Human Research Program to produce a lot of content around these hazards.  They have a video series and their whole website dedicated to the five hazards of human space flight.  So just go to NASA.gov/hrp if you want -- for more information there.  There are actually really cool animation videos.  Otherwise you can go on social media, Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram, and NASA Johnson Space Center Accounts.

                        "description": "Gary Jordan (Host): Houston, We Have a Podcast.  Welcome to the official podcast of the NASA Johnson Space Center, Episode 59: Distance.  This is part three of our five-part series on the hazards of human spaceflight.  I'm Gary Jordan, and I'll be your host today.  On this podcast we bring in the experts, NASA scientists, engineers, and astronauts all to let you know the coolest information about what's going on right here at NASA.  So today we consider another hazard of human spaceflight, the distance from Earth, with Dr. Eric Antonson.  Dr. Antonson is currently the element scientist for exploration medical capabilities and the assistant director of human systems risk management at the NASA Johnson Space Center.  He's also an assistant professor of emergency medicine and space medicine at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, Texas -- a lot of medicines.  And clinically he works as an attending emergency physician at Ben Taub General Hospital.  His focus lies on the intersection between medicine and spaceflight.  And he's currently tasked with minimizing the risks associated with isolation during exploration-class missions and the inability to provide appropriate medical care.   But first I wanted to start off one last time with Dr. Mike Barrett, who as a NASA astronaut and former flight surgeon gave his own thoughts on the challenges that are presented when traveling far, far away.    Mike Barrett: Well, I think there's many aspects to that.  One, I have to kind of think about the medical issues that -- we know our crews are going to be healthy when we launch them, and we're going to do our best to keep them healthy during flight with countermeasures and diet and medical monitoring.  But if an acute event happens, somebody, for instance, starts clutching their lower abdomen and peeing out blood, then we think there's a kidney stone, you know, that could definitely happen.    Host: Oh.    Mike Barrett: So in this case, instead of getting a panic call to the ground, asking immediately to talk to the surgeon, what we may get is a report saying, \"Crew member so and so was clutching their abdomen in very bad pain.  We pulled out the ultrasound, we found a stone.  We think it's passing.  We've given pain meds, and they're resting comfortably.\"  That's the kind of paradigm that we're moving to so that the crew members, again, are able to respond to an event and handle it the best they can and give us reports and ask for advice, so to speak, consultation rather than real-time guidance.  And that, again, is very exploration-oriented.  And if we have a whatever settlement or colony or outpost on Mars, that's the paradigm.  So that begins with the exploration transit.    Host: Yeah, there's a lot of factors that go into that.  Now you're not -- you have to -- you have another base of knowledge that you have to have as a baseline for wherever you go out.  Because instead of calling immediately to the ground, like you said, and getting the aid, the knowledge of the experts on the ground instantly, now you have to know sort of what to deal with.  And then that mentality of not working together, the mentality of doing it yourself and reporting the progress.    Mike Barrett: Which, truth be told, I think even crew members on station right now -- we understand that we're trying hard to produce science, and having more consultation with the ground is really important.  But more crew autonomy is recommended by almost every crew who returns from station, partly to enhance the efficiency and partly for peace of mind.  But it is something that crew members really, I think, naturally want and will move into quite nicely.  I have to think I had a very small combustion event on the Space Station while I was up there, really almost non-consequential, but that piece of hardware on the Russian segment started billowing smoke and overheating.  And, of course, we were able to immediately call to the ground.  And they knew about it immediately because of smoke detectors and whatnot.  And in this paradigm, it would have been a call back that maybe they would have found out between 8 and 22 minutes later that we had this little combustion event, we pulled circuit breakers, this is what we found.  Everything is fine now.  We replaced the part that was burning, and we are in normal ops recovery.   How was your day?  So, again, that's kind of the paradigm that we'll get to with exploration.    Host: Thanks to Dr. Barrett for providing such great insight over these past few episodes.  So with no further delay, let's jump right ahead to our talk about the hazard of distance with Dr. Eric Antonson.  Enjoy.     [ Music ]    Host: Eric, thanks for joining me here today to talk about the distance from Earth.    Eric Antonson: I appreciate you having me on.    Host: And this is -- this is an interesting topic because it seems so obvious, right?  Of course we're going to be far away, but with that comes a series of very challenging things that we're going to have to overcome to be successful.  So from a broad perspective, if you were -- if someone were to ask you, \"Well, why is distance such a problem?\"  how would you start?    Eric Antonson: It has to do with understanding the implications of what distance from Earth means.  We have grown up in the space age sort of operating in a relatively close position to Earth for the entirety of our program.  And the -- we've had nine missions that have gone outside of low-earth orbit with humans on them.  Those nine missions, the last time that happened was in 1972, right?    Host: Yeah.    Eric Antonson: So there's a question of sort of the corporate memory of how to do that.  But there's also a difference in scale and time for the missions that we're talking about.  Those missions were like camping trips.     [ Laughter ]  We -- we spent most of our time learning the skills that we needed to learn in low-earth orbit where we had some advantages, right?  And those advantages from the Human Health and Performance side of the world really can be summed up as three things.  One is if something really goes wrong with a crew member, you come back to Earth.  You can evacuate them.  And that's a reasonably quick timeframe.  Another one is that if you need to resupply something -- consumables, medications, food, whatever it is -- that you have a pretty reasonable chance at having a good supply chain for that.  And then the last one is beyond evacuation and consumables, the ability to actually talk, right?  Real-time communications is something that we rely on in the current operational paradigm, and most people don't realize how much we rely on it.  Everything that the crew does is scheduled down to the minute in many cases or at least the five-minute increment.  And if they have a challenge with all the myriad of different things that they're asked to be experts in and do on the Space Station right now, they get to reach back, right?   If there's an anomaly, or something wrong, or they can't quite figure out how to get this screw off, they get to reach back through the radio in real time and ask somebody, \"Hey, why isn't this working?  Can you help me out?\"  Right?  In the context of low-earth orbit, that means that a lot of their -- the information that they have to rely on, the knowledge, the memory, and the ability to process that information is actually displaced from the crew members down to mission control where you have a bunch of people sitting in a room thinking about this, who all have a bunch of people behind them sitting in a room also thinking about this with immediate access to a lot of data that the crew members aren't going to have.  Now, take us out of that paradigm, right?  Take us someplace far enough away from Earth where you have those three things challenged, you end up in a place where with Mars closest approach, you may have a one-minute -- three minutes one-way delay in communication.  And that's just one way, right?   And at its farthest approach you're talking about the speed of light taking 22 and a half minutes one way to get back to Earth.  And so that ability, then, to reach back and talk to somebody and say, \"Hey, what do I do about this thing that broke here?\"  You don't have that real-time feedback anymore.  Right?  And it gets longer and longer and longer the further you go from Earth.  When we're around the moon, you still have reasonably close to real-time communications, and we can probably establish a logistics chain to get medicines, food, and other things that we need reasonably well, right?  The thing that's really impacted there is if somebody has a medical issue or a problem and they need to be evacuated, you're no longer talking about, you know, a few hours to 36 hours down from low-earth orbit to definitive medical care.  Now you're talking about three days, maybe six days, maybe even longer depending on the orbit and the logistics of actually organizing these things.   So all of a sudden, instead of being able to rely on hey, if something bad happens, I can just take this crew member down to Earth and we can deal with it there, now you have to ask the question of how do I figure out in the really limited mass and volume that we have and potentially the limited data telemetry that we have going back and forth between Earth, how do we get enough information and support to our crews so they can make decisions and do just enough to keep somebody alive or stabilize them for that journey that's going to take a much longer time than it did before?    Host: Yeah.    Eric Antonson: And at Mars, if you don't have that evacuation capability, you're kind of in trouble, right?  Because the size of the spacecraft and the amount of stuff that we can bring is only getting smaller.    Host: Right.    Eric Antonson: Right?  That's one of the big challenges.  We get less volume to put things in.  We get less mass that we get to carry up there.  For medical and human performance things, that can mean everything from the food nutrition that you eat to the medicines that you'd like to use, right?  All of that sort of stuff, you have less room for it.  But maybe even more importantly, the skillsets, right?  How do you know when something's a problem?  And this is what terrestrial medicine struggles with, right?  When you have somebody come to the emergency department, more often than what they're really asking is, \"Hey, I've got this thing,\" either a rash on my skin or a pole sticking out of me or whatever it is, [Laughs] how big of a problem is this, and how dangerous is this, and how fast does it need to be addressed?    Host: The pole's got to be a big one.    Eric Antonson: I would think so.  Some of these are intuitive, but some of them aren't, right?  I mean, think about when you go to the doctor, right?  Something hurts in my belly, and I don't know what to do about it, right?  And it's not going away.    Host: Right.    Eric Antonson: And so that could be anything from I got some food poisoning from something I ate to my appendix is getting ready to burst, to my pancreas is inflamed, to my gallbladder is a problem, right?  That's a huge amount of knowledge that physicians and nurses and other healthcare professionals piece together to try to figure out, all right, am I worried about this or am I not?    Host: Yeah.    Eric Antonson: And in a setting where you're on the way to Mars, or even around the moon, you know, the decision to actually evacuate somebody or to try to have to intervene on something at the worst can mean loss of human life if we don't plan correctly and at the best might mean screwing up a multibillion-dollar program that we spent a lot of money to put somebody there to do a mission that they no longer can do.    Host: Seems like -- so you're talking about these three things, right?  We're talking about these camping trips that -- talking, resupplying.  And these elements, it seems like I can just sum them up to autonomy is really what it comes down to, elements and -- of autonomy in all of these procedures and the way that we do things.  They're not going to have the help that they have right now on the International Space Station as much.    Eric Antonson: As much is the keyword there, right?  Because it's sort of figuring out what's the appropriate degree of autonomy so that you're not overdesigning a system, you're not trying to do more than you have to do?  But you do enough to make sure that the crew that you put in place has the knowledge, the skills, the abilities, all the things and the resources that they need to deal with the things that are most likely to happen or those things that are most likely to be preventable that, you know, we really should be able to deal with beforehand.  That's a huge amount of things, right?  That's a -- that's everything that could possibly go wrong in the human body is on the list.  And how do you start -- how do you start whittling that down?  [Laughs] I mean, that's a really big challenge.    Host: Yeah.  So if you're talking about a crew going to -- let's just say as part of the crew of a moon habitat -- or let's just say a Mars has been to the in this instance, I'm guessing you would probably want to vouch for a medical person, a medical expert as part of that crew.    Eric Antonson: So right now in the standards that NASA has, for anything that's considered a planetary mission, we have a requirement to have a physician-level crew member --    Host: There you go.    Eric Antonson: -- as part of that crew.  But outside of planetary, if you're talking about going to the moon, we don't have that requirement, right?  And -- and that's -- it's a judgment call, right?  Where do you draw that line?  It's hard to say.    Host: Yeah.    Eric Antonson: Right?  We have been successfully flying people on the International Space Station for 18 years now, right?  And there have been a lot of medical issues that you probably haven't heard about.  But there haven't been, like, issues to the level of having to evacuate or having to, you know, consider surgery in-flight or things like that, right?  But that's also in a domain where we have things relatively controlled.  So if you transpose that back to the Apollo missions, right, to the moon, we actually had a very well-known case with Fred Hayes on Apollo 13 --    Host: Yeah.    Eric Antonson: -- when he got sick, right?  If you went to see the movie Apollo 13, you they that -- that that character, that astronaut got very sick on the way back.  And actually, getting a little bit of insight into the story around that is very instructive for how we would think about going back to the moon or how we would think about going further out.  See, most people, when they think about the risks that humans face in spaceflight in long duration and outside the Earth's magnetosphere, they focus on things like radiation.  They focus on exercise, bone loss, all these sort of things.  Sometimes isolation with the behavioral health issues.  But it's really hard to quantify what is likely to be the risk from the medical side of things?  And so we do probabilistic risk analysis, and we look all the what has happened in spaceflight, we look at what has happened to the astronaut corps on the ground, and we build an evidence base that helps us to try to get our heads around what we think is likely to happen, right?  And on Apollo 13, what we saw was a case that's sort of a real-world check for how well we're doing, right?    Host: Yeah.    Eric Antonson: So interestingly, he had gotten a urinary tract infection, right?  These are not very common for men on the ground.  And there's an anatomical reason why.  They're much more common in women than men because of the length of the urethra that women have, right?  But in space, we actually find that that difference fall apart.  It changes.  We've have had urinary tract infections -- actually a fair amount in men -- up on the Space Station in the MIR program.  And the reason why is because of what the spacecraft environment actually does to your body.  When you go up in microgravity, all your fluids come up out of your legs, and it turns on your carotid baroreceptors, and it changes the way your kidneys work, and you start peeing out a lot of fluid.  And so you get dehydrated, that's one thing.  And when they go up, they also end up having some neurovestibular challenges as the signals coming from their eyes get decoupled with the signals coming from their semicircular canals in their ears.  So they get space motion sickness or nausea, right?  And so they'll take some medicines for that, which are -- Phenergan is one example of them.   Those medicines can actually cause -- one of the side effects that they cause is urinary retention, which can lead to urinary tract infections, right?  And so there's a few different factors that contribute to hey, why do these people get urinary tract infections in this domain?  And the problem is once they get them, then you have to treat them, right?  Crews, when they get retention, will go in and self-cath, which is not a comfortable things to think about.  But this is actually part of the reality of being in a different environment like this.    Host: Oh.    Eric Antonson: And guess what?  That also potentially can introduce bacteria into the urinary tract, right?    Host: Huh.    Eric Antonson: So when Fred Hayes had his problem, part of the reason why he had the problem was because he kept a condom catheter on too long that was supposed to collect urine.    Host: Oh.    Eric Antonson: Right?  A simple thing that could have been avoided.  But then what happened is he got sicker.  So as urinary tracts progress, most of the time we think of a UTI in terrestrial parlance as something you give a few pieces of antibiotics a couple of days and all of a sudden you're better, right?  But in men it's not always that simple.  So we try to figure out well, how bad is the infection, right?  So for Fred, we had a heart rate monitor, and an increasing heart rate is one signal or one thing that we look at to say are they getting sicker or not getting sicker?  And he was getting sicker.  We had a thermometer, but it was broken.  So we actually couldn't tell if he had a fever or not.  We had two different antibiotics that were on the spacecraft at the time, but when we cultured his urine when he got back, we actually found out that those antibiotics wouldn't have worked, that the bug was resistant.  It was a Pseudomonas aeruginosa strain that was resistant to the antibiotics.  So if we would have tried to treat him with those antibiotics, they wouldn't have helped, right?  So what happens, then, is the urinary tract ascends and can get to the kidney and can cause sepsis.   And this is one of those things that is now you've got a very big problem that, if you were able to deal with it in the beginning when it was a small problem and keep it from becoming a big problem, you would have been much better off.  So we were lucky with Fred in one sense, even though his spacecraft blew up and he, you know, nearly lost his life because of the problems with Apollo 13.  He actually was lucky that he was already being evacuated back home.  So once they got home, they were able to treat him with the full armamentarium of resources that they have at any hospital, right, and fix him.  Transplant that to a crew that's got three more months left to get to Mars, no ability to evacuate, you can't actually put any new medicines on there if the ones that you have don't work.  If you had broken your thermometer, you wouldn't even have insight into how bad he's getting, right?  So what we learned from that -- and when we do our modeling sepsis and urinary sepsis is one of those conditions that we worry the most about -- what we learn from that is we need to figure out how to plan medical and Human Health and Performance resources to try to deal with the things that are most likely to happen when they're small problems, not when they're big problems.    Host: So when this happened, you did the analysis and realized that the antibiotics that we had onboard wouldn't have helped anyway.  That begs the question well, which ones do you bring on board?  How do you know what's going to happen to a crew and what things you're going to have to treat?  And that's got to be a huge challenge.  Because finite resources is one thing.  And like you said, if you want to go home, it's going to be months until you actually can -- if you don't have the antibiotic at hand, it's going to be months.    Eric Antonson: Yeah, this is a big challenge.  And one of the things that we do, it's actually a very unique capability at NASA in the Human Health and Performance Directorate is we merged an engineering technique called probabilistic risk assessment with medical evidence-based medical needs.  And so there's a team called the integrated medical model that works on hey, let's take all the instances and all the things that we know that have happened in human spacecraft as much as we can and we'll put that into a database, right?  And then we're going to go and look at analog populations, like submariners and people who live in Antarctica, and see what happens with them.  And maybe it's not the same thing as spaceflight, but it's a close approximation.  Then we're going to go look out at the terrestrial literature and see for the things that we know that have happened in spaceflight or things that have happened to our astronauts on the ground, let's see how often those things happen, right?  And you start building up an evidence base that allows you to get an incidence; how often do things occur?  Right?  And how often do they occur in our domain or in domains that are like that, right?  And then you can start actually bring statistical tools to bear to start saying, all right, let's look at what is most likely to happen, let's start looking what the consequences of those things are, what capabilities we would need to deal with those things, what medications we would like to have.   And then you start building up massive databases of this information and process that -- all that data.  And you actually run Monte Carlo models to predict well, how many times is this likely to happen based on what we know from the past, right?    Host: Right.    Eric Antonson: That gets you in the ballpark.     [ Laughter ]    Host: All that for a ballpark.    Eric Antonson: It's a huge amount of work just to get in a ballpark.  But it's an evidence-based ballpark.    Host: Yes.    Eric Antonson: It's not a single flight surgeon or somebody else sitting there saying, \"Well, you know, I saw this one guy who had a urinary tract infection, so we should take this medicine instead of that one,\" right?  And this is the challenge of -- of a growing and learning space program, right?  Sixty years ago we were not even necessarily trying to collect a ton of data because we didn't know what was going to be important, what wasn't.  It was just the challenge of getting there.    Host: Right, doing it and then figuring it out.    Eric Antonson: Right?  A huge the amount of risk really up in until today has been borne by the launch vehicle, the landing, right, Challenger, Columbia.  And a huge amount of risk has not been the failure of the human system within those things, right?  But as we go to this greater distance from Earth and longer missions because of that greater distance, that proportion of risk that we carry that is the human system likely to fail gets bigger and bigger and bigger.  And the launch and the landing at the beginning and end of that mission makes up a smaller and smaller proportion of the total risk you carry.  So part of what we're doing with the ISS and other programs that we work on is to try to build up our understanding of how's that human system likely to fail?  What are the things that are most concerning that we need to deal with?  And it's not just medicine, right?  This is behavioral health.  When you put people into isolated chambers as a team for multiple years -- if you remember the Biosphere II project, right, they had eight people for two years stuck in that container, and they ended up all hating each other [Laughs], which is not the team dynamics you really want to have when you're trying to do one of the most challenging things that our species has ever done.    Host: Absolutely.    Eric Antonson: So a lot of research that we do within this domain is to try to make sure that in the isolation and confinement that happens for this small tin can that we're sending, you know, across the solar system, that we have an understanding of the ways in which people are going to suffer the stress, potential depression, challenges in social dynamics.  And this is all behavioral health research that goes on at NASA, trying to inform those.  In addition to that, that distance from Earth sort of hazard also crosses a line when we leave the magnetosphere and all of a sudden we have more and more radiation to worry about, right?    Host: Right.    Eric Antonson: This is the one that everybody thinks of as a giant risk.  And it's a big risk, but it's in addition to all these other things that we're talking about.  So all the different things that could go wrong start stacking up.  And we spend a lot of time and effort trying to figure out, okay, how do we prioritize these things?  How do we figure out what are the stuff that we really need to deal with?  And how do we design systems so they are intuitive, so they help the crew with more autonomy, so they actually augment the crew?  We're not looking to replace the crew with an IBM Watson or something that's like artificial intelligence.    Host: Sure.    Eric Antonson: I think a lot of times people think that well, we could put Watson on this spacecraft and it might be able to replace the doctor.  We don't see that being something realistic anytime in the near future.    Host: Humans are too good?    Eric Antonson: Humans are too good.  And part of the purpose of human spaceflight is for us to explore and to -- and to utilize those skills that humans have.  We've already sent robots all over the space -- all over the solar system, right?    Host: Yeah.    Eric Antonson: This is the next wave.  This is what happens when we try to go there and try to figure out how we do things, and how we function, and how we respond to this environment.    Host: That's always the feedback I get.  Because that's a question that I love asking all my guests, really, is why do humans have to explore?  And it's that -- I mean, you just can't replace the perspective that you get from sending someone to another planet, or destination, or out in the universe in some thing.    Eric Antonson: I think it's actually more fundamental than that.    Host: Really?    Eric Antonson: I don't know that it's you can't replace it because you can't right now -- maybe someday in the future you could -- bit it's really that you wouldn't want to.     [ Laughter ]  It's a prior assumption, right?  We're going there to learn not only about these places but also about ourselves, about our place in the universe, about how we respond and change.  And we're learning these things on the Space Station right now.  When you talk about the things that happen in astronauts' brains and their eyes and how they're learning to accommodate to long-duration spaceflight what we're really talking about is learning about us in a different environment and what happens, how do we do it?  This -- this group of astronauts that exists in this closed container, we've selected them to be really healthy people, right?    Host: Yeah.    Eric Antonson: So if I'm thinking about clinical research and medicine and I want to ask a question about, you know, what happens if I have this one insult on a healthy person, right, these guys are a control group for an experiment that we as a species are doing, trying to understand how we learn about ourselves.  So when we talk about loss of bone, loss of muscle, these are analogs for other diseases and things that can help us inform how we think about those diseases in terrestrial populations in ways that we'd never be able to do on the Earth.    Host: Now, this kind of leads nicely to -- I'm going to kind of combine that with some of the previous statements you made about, you know, we're talking about the supplies and your thoughts about what do we need to collect, what sort -- you know, thinking antibiotics and medicines and supplies?  But then also fitting that with a crew that's going to work well together.  If you're thinking about going to a destination farther away, now you're talking about, I guess, less and less space -- livable space to do that.  You know, we'll have a transit vehicle that's going to go out, and then we're going to have a habitat, but those things -- we're really constrained by the mass that we can bring and the space that's going to be available.  And if you're talking, you know, this group of eight people that hate each other after two years, you know, missions to Mars, they can be longer than that.  So how do you know -- how do you know what to bring and the masses that you -- based on what you think, this is the medical supplies that we can bring that is going to sustain these people?  But then also the people themselves, thinking about those things?    Eric Antonson: You're really talking about the merger of the science that we do, which is building up an evidence base and an understanding that we can draw from strong conclusions about what's important and what's not, what the size of effects are, and the relative proportion of things that are likely to happen, and the merger with engineering kind of in a systems engineering type of world, right?  When you build a spacecraft, right, you have a whole bunch of different subsystems for that spacecraft that you got to accommodate.  You have the structures to hold it all together; you have the propulsion system to push it all around; you have the power system to make sure that you can turn the lights on, turn the lights off, do whatever you need to do.  Those are all sort of well understood piece parts of a vehicle.  And then you also have this human system, right?    Host: Yeah.    Eric Antonson: Which is the people, yes, but then all the things you need to keep the people alive, like the food, and the consumables, and the things that you're talking about.  And then also along with that, the monitoring and the tools that you need to understand the environment that they're living in; is this staying within the parameters we like?  The people themselves, are they staying within the parameters that we like?  That's where heart rate, and temperature, and some fundamental vital signs, and things like that are really important to know, right?  And so it's this gigantic smorgasbord of a lot of information that has to be put together in a systematic approach, right?  And that's why this is such a fascinating both scientific and engineering problem, right?  We are trying to do something that's never been done before in the history of our species.  When I show slides that have, like, the solar system with the sun in the middle and the Earth and then Mars and their relative positions, and I talk about hey, the distance here, the distance that we're going just to get to Mars, one of the things that I say is, \"You see that little blue dot that is representing Earth?   At this scale on the solar system, our entire species, everything we've ever known is still within the size of that dot, even the visits to the moon are still within the size of that dot.\"  When I put it up with the Mars orbital distances, right?    Host: Right.    Eric Antonson: Like, this has to have and has to involve the most rigorous, systematic, and disciplined approaches to both, you know, no kidding understanding what is happening to the human body in this domain and how it changes -- the mind, the behavioral health issues, our response to the radiation environment, galactic cosmic rays, potential solar particle events, our likelihood of medical conditions occurring.  You know, the risk that we buy down from selecting the healthiest people in the world has been great for low-earth orbit, but you get diminishing returns when you get out to three years.  These people are not superhuman.    Host: Right.    Eric Antonson: They're still human, right?  And so what you're really talking about when you say, \"How do we approach this problem?\"  well, some of that probabilistic risk analysis and modeling is part of it, but we're still building the tools for a lot of these things.  We're still building models, we're still building experiments.  The Human Research Program is still trying to make sure that they make investments in places where they get results that inform positively do we care about this, is it really important, or should we move on to the next problem?  Because we got a long line of problems that we have to challenge, right?    Host: Yeah.  And you kind of alluded to this before -- and this is -- I'm going to bounce into a topic, you know, thinking about we have so many questions that we need to answer, but we are investigating things right now.  So let's go into that.  You know, what do we know?  What do we know right?  And there's been instances like you said before -- you kind of hinted at this in beginning -- there's been, you know, medical things happening you said on MIR.  What were some of the things that were happening?  And then what did we do to resolve them real-time?    Eric Antonson: Yeah.  So there's -- there's a variety of different things.  And this actually feeds how well we validate some of the modeling that we do to try to predict the future.  Right?  You remember that there was one episode where there was a fire on MIR.  And one of the medical issues that comes out of that is smoke inhalation.  All of a sudden you got people inhaling smoke -- maybe haven't gotten to their mask in time or things like that.  And now you have this exposure potentially toxic exposure that's also causing them to cough and to, you know, not be able to function.  And you have to make a decision about hey, do we actually, like, get out of here, right?  Even if you contain the fire, if you've got a crew member who is incapacitated because of the results of that fire because of burns or because of smoke inhalation or something like that or, you know, maybe that fire damaged something like the ammonia lines and all of a sudden off toxic exposure, right, you have to try decide what do we do about that in real time?  There were -- there was at least one case of a cosmonaut who had a cardiac dysrhythmia who was disorbited from it.  And -- and we've seen changes in heart rhythm as we've gone through the space program.   There have been astronauts that had atrial fibrillation.  The question mark is, like, is this something that, you know, we need to not have somebody fly for?  Or all of a sudden, you know, they never had this problem, and you get into spaceflight and maybe they have it there.  We actually haven't seen any of that in the American cohort, but there was one Russian who was deorbited for it.  And then there's that question of, like, if you follow that to its logical conclusion, all right, that sort of explains why we do the biological monitoring that we do -- heart rate, that sort of stuff.  You see in Apollo 13 and other movies they have these pads on and you got a signal sending down to the ground.  Sometimes your problem is you may actually have too much information and information that you don't know what to do with.  So a lot of what we continue to learn as we go forward is do we really want to know this?  Right?  And what I mean by that is something we find things in clinical medicine on the ground that we call incidentalomas, right?  You go and you scan somebody's head because they -- you know, they got in a car accident and you're worried about it.  And you don't find any evidence of trauma, but you find something there that you're not sure what to do with that wasn't bothering them before.   Now that can set off a chain of events.  Do we have to go look at that further?  Do we have more specialists involved?  Does somebody get poked and prodded?  Do we start causing more problems than we solve because we saw this thing that we don't know what the significance is?  And that happens in terrestrial medicine all the time.    Host: Right.    Eric Antonson: Now transplant that to the spaceflight environment where something happened.  We measured something, we don't know if this is a big problem or not.  Are we going to do more harm than good to a crew member or to a team by chasing after it, or should we wait and see?  Right?  That's a challenge.  This is in the clinical world.  In my job in emergency medicine I run into this a lot, right?    Host: Yeah.    Eric Antonson: What's the appropriate amount of concern that I should have for somebody who's really healthy, highly functioning, not having any problems?  And then there's this thing, a CT scan or an ultrasound that was found, right?    Host: Yeah.  And it sound like a judgment call based on the physician on the ground.  But the problem is now you're not getting as much data as we go further away, correct?    Eric Antonson: And so you now find that line, which is where the science and the art of doing these things meets, right?  I mean, in clinical medicine today, right, we don't know everything.  There's still lots -- huge -- amounts of clinical trials going on that inform us and update us on what the best things to do are for our patients.  It's no different in spaceflight.  As we go longer and learn more, we incorporate the corporate memory that we've had from the past and the things that we're learning there to update what we're doing.  But at some point you're operating in a domain where you don't have a huge amount of evidence to influence what you do.  And this is where flight surgeons and operational support have to make judgment calls.  And that is that line between science and art of how you actually do these things.  And that's the beautiful thing about this job is that you live in that domain where we're constantly pushing the boundaries of what we know and how we understand it in the larger system of what we're doing.  And you get to build the science to help inform the art.    Host: So I'm guess we have a lot of -- a lot of practice with the International Space Station now?    Eric Antonson: So you've got 18 years of people being up there.    Host: Right.    Eric Antonson: That -- it's interesting.  When people bring up, \"Hey I have this concern,\" right?  Radiation is going to turn bacteria into these horrible, mutant, virulent beasts, and people are going to get sicker than they've ever gotten before.  And then you look at the Space Station, and yeah, we swab the surfaces and we measure this stuff.  And we have scientists here look at samples and all that sort of stuff.  And yeah, there's some stuff growing up there that, you know, you don't want to hear about.  But at the same time in 18 years, you've never really had somebody get sick from those particular bacteria or those things growing.  You're not having this epidemic of astronauts, you know, all of a sudden, you know, ending up incapacitated because there's some fungus or some mold growing in the corner, right?  And so it's that -- that's part of what informs the judgment, right, is hey, how do square the science and the things that we're learning about the way genetics, and bacteria, and viruses get modified in this new environment, and our own body's immune systems changes, and our T-cells drop over time when we're in microgravity and low-earth orbit?   And what are the consequences of that?  And then you look up at the clinical level and you say, \"Well, nobody's really getting that sick, so how much do I have to care?\"  That's great, six months.  We've got a pretty good establishment of that.    Host: Yeah.    Eric Antonson: I'm not too worried about it.  Three years with all three of those things that we were talking about earlier no longer being available.  How comfortable do we feel extending that sort of experience-based judgment calls and the art side of this out into that domain?  And that's what helps us guide where we put our research investments in the science is to help inform that for these longer, and longer, and longer duration things that we're looking to do.    Host: Which is a lot of what we're doing on the Space Station is learning what we learn here, we get to kind of package and then take out.  Obviously there's going to be things we're going to have to learn along the way.  But it's a pretty good model, especially operationally whenever we're doing things day-to-day.  I did want to circle back, though, to you said there's stuff growing on the Space Station, you know, all the time.  But 18 years, not really a concern.  What's growing, and how come medically we're okay?    Eric Antonson: Well, this is, like, if you think about your house on Earth, right?    Host: Yeah.    Eric Antonson: And you can certainly find websites and companies that want to go clean up all the fungus and the mold in your house.  And maybe at some point you get to a point where that stuff actually starts to bother the people in your house or you have people who start having allergic reactions, but, you know, it's really not a different thing than there.  There's fungus, there's bacteria.  There's a variety of bacteria that we bring on our skin everywhere we go.  Right?  And some of these are the most common bacterias that we worry about in terms of infections, right?  Staphylococcus aureus is a naturally occurring colonizing species on your skin -- we all have it.    Host: Eww.    Eric Antonson: I know, I'm sorry.  Staphylococcus, right, when you think about strep throat, these things live on our skin, right?  They don't really actually cause problems for us until they get into someplace where they're not supposed to be, like, for example, if somebody gets a cut and all of a sudden, like, bacteria from the skin is now down in the bloodstream or in the subcutaneous tissue and all of a sudden, you know, maybe you get an infection there.  If you're really healthy, you probably don't.  In terrestrial medicine the places where we see this is people with diabetes and with suppressed immune systems and stuff like that, right?  That's where we really worry about it in terrestrial medicine.  But hey, when we've measured the T-cells in our own immune system in flight, we've seen some changes there.  We see the T-cells decreasing over time in the microgravity environment.  So where is that point at which hey, we're kind of approaching an immune suppressed status and we might need to worry about this more?  In the case of these six-month missions, we haven't reached that point, which makes us feel good, right?  That's -- that's helpful.  But at a year or two years as we stretch that out, do the T-cells keep dropping or do they threshold and plateau someplace?   If think threshold and plateau someplace, maybe it won't be a problem with all the bacteria we brought up.  Maybe our body can handle it because it normally can.  But I don't know if they plateau or if it keeps going down and then you're going to have a problem in two and a half years right at that point you're on your way back from Mars but you still have long enough to go that you could get really sick and not be able to do much about it.  And by the way, all those medicines you brought with you?  If we look at the formulary on the International Space Station right now, about 16% of those medications that are on the International Space Station could within the labeled expiration dates actually make a trip out to Mars and back.    Host: That's good to know.    Eric Antonson: So on the way back, if you still have three months to go, most of your medicines, they may not work if we were just using what we had on the Space Station today.    Host: So what do we do to extend the life?    Eric Antonson: That's a good question [Laughs].  That's one of the areas that when I was working for exploration medical capabilities, we laid out a pharmacy research plan to try to address just that stuff, right?    Host: Right.    Eric Antonson: Some medications seem to be affected by the spaceflight environment.  We've left stuff up there for about 880 days and we've seen increased degradation rates in what we call the API's -- the active pharmaceutical ingredients -- compared to stuff that's on the ground, right, controls that we look at.  And it's hard to suss out why.  Maybe some of it's radiation, maybe some of it's the environment, some other things.  But what we're trying to get heads around is are there biochemical categories of medications that make more sense to rely on because other ones break down faster in that environment?  Some things that are happening in the pharmaceutical industry in terms of, you know, adding additives to pharmaceutical makeups can actually extend those expiration dates; can we take advantage of those sort of things?  Do we try to make medicines that instead of having to take twice or three times a day for ten days for your antibiotic course, you take once, right?  NASA doesn't do that stuff, but we look to the pharmaceutical industries and the advances that they take to try and pull intelligently the things that are going to extend our pharmacy and make it more functional over the timeframes we're talking about.    Host: Yeah.  Now, this -- this kind of goes back to you talking about, you know, what happens after six months?  Does it plateau or does the immune functionality continue to decrease?  What knows?  But my assumption would be if it does, if we do have to worry about possibly go -- decreasing -- now maybe you're taking more medication, now maybe you're being extra careful where if you do get a cut, oh, you want to patch that up immediately because you don't want anything getting in.  Now you're talking about using more resources.    Eric Antonson: And having to bring more to be able to enable that.    Host: Right.    Eric Antonson: Which we don't have a lot of volume for.    Host: Right.    Eric Antonson: It's this -- this ultimate backpack game, right?    Host: Yeah.    Eric Antonson: How do you build up the best understanding of what changes are going to happen and being impactful?  So you only bring the things that really matter.  Like, right now we have a defibrillator up on the Space Station, and it's an ongoing source of discussion, right?  You're familiar with the defibrillator like in the airport?  You put it on, you shock somebody's heart if their heart were to stop.    Host: Clear, yeah.    Eric Antonson: Clear, bzzt [Laughs].    Host: Right.    Eric Antonson: The whole -- the whole point of that sort of thing is that when the heart enters certain electrical rhythms that don't pump blood, you stun it and reset it, right?  But what you're really talking about, the underlying problem before that and after that is what's wrong with this person that their heart actually entered that?  And most of the things that would lead to that are stuff we screen for and get out of the way in the astronaut corps, right?  So we don't really expect them to be in a position where they're probably going to need that.  The likelihood of it happening is extremely low.  And so if you're really up against the wall in terms of the volume, does it make sense to bring that, right?    Host: Right.    Eric Antonson: I don't know because it's a really, really, really low likelihood event, but it's really high consequences if it happens.  But part of the way we answer that is by looking at all right, what else comes with that?  If you actually shock somebody, it doesn't mean they're automatically okay, right?  This is not TV.  [Laughs] It means that you've got a whole bunch of other work to do and a whole bunch of other resources to bring to bear to do resuscitation on somebody who's really sick.  And the odds of us being able to supply those sort of things in this small volume and space is really, really small, right?  So now you start asking the question, \"Is that a risk we're willing to take?\"  And it's a challenge.    Host: Yeah.  Because now you think about oh man, but what if we do need it, right?  But you're saying -- you're pretty confident based on we've flown so many times and we've gotten, you know -- if you're thinking back to Fred Hayes, back to that time, we were kind of figuring out spaceflight.  That was the whole point of Mercury, and Gemini, and Apollo is to keep going further and kind of figure it out along the way.  Now we've done it a lot.  We kind of know what we need to do before a spaceflight to make that spaceflight successful medically too.  So yeah, maybe you can kind of take it away and feel confident learning from these operations.    Eric Antonson: To paraphrase Frank Borman when he was sitting in front of Congress, right, the places that we're going to fail after this much time are the places where we have a failure of imagination, right?  It's the things that we didn't know about that are going to come and bite us.  And there's going to be enough of those.  So we have to intelligently plan for the things that we do know about.  If something is really, really low likelihood, we probably need to be making room for things that are much more high likelihood that will help to us make sure that we don't let those small problems, the little cuts to the skin, the infection in the urine, the other things like that grow into the big problems that all of a sudden we're never going to be able to provide the resources to handle if it reaches something like a sepsis level.    Host: Do you find that, you know, meeting with other doctors and other people in your field, getting together, you're still coming up with more questions that needs to be answered?    Eric Antonson: I would say that all good science lead to more questions.     [ Laughter ]  That's just the reality of the world in which we live, right?  As soon as you start nailing down something in the evidence base, you immediately have the question of wait, but what if this happens or what if our assumptions about this weren't correct?  How does that change what we would do?  And that's an ongoing conversation and question that we have with the flight surgeons, and the research doctors, and the research scientists, and the immunologists, and the toxicologists, and the systems engineers?  Like, this is what the ongoing conversation is that occurs between the people doing a lot of the research in these areas and the people who are doing operations right now for the programs that we have set up.  I mean, SS is the most big and visible of them.    Host: Sure.    Eric Antonson: But there's other things that are happening -- the commercial crew programs and how we interface with those guys, Orion's coming up, and then soon to be Gateway.  Like, these are all going to have unique challenges.  And everybody that's got experience to bring to bear, they have a piece of the puzzle for figuring out how to do it safely and how to do it right.  Right?  And then there's also people who are working in field that we haven't had to pull on yet that are going to have other pieces of the puzzle.  So how to do it safely and how to do it right?    Host: Now I know, I mean, just personally working with large groups, you get a lot of different input and diversity of thought, which is good.  But then you have everyone providing so much input that you can't agree on anything.    Eric Antonson: At some point you got to make a decision [Laughs].  How does that happen?    Host: That was going to be my question.  How do you -- I mean, you do want as much information as possible.  Because that's how you're going to be successful.  But then how do you -- how do you know which things to sacrifice?  You know, you're already talking about a defibrillator.  How do you know which things to sacrifice to come to an agreement on this is the most important elements of what's going to make a mission successful?    Eric Antonson: Yeah, so part of this question is really wrapped in what at NASA or who at NASA makes decisions, right, after they have looked across all this stuff?  So there's a couple of different places.  I work with the Human Health and Performance directorate.  My job right now is assistant director for humans systems risk management.  And one of those parts of that job is to chair the human systems risk board.  I started that a couple months ago, it's actually a new job for me.    Host: Oh, cool.    Eric Antonson: But the purpose of the board is to look across all the risks that we have to try to assess the evidence base to understand, hey, how big of a problem is this, how well do we understand what as going on, how well do we expect to know what's going on in a few years, you know, and how do we prioritize where we should put our investments?  And that board is a wide group of people who look at these problems from a bunch of different angles.  And they come together and no kidding, no everybody goes away happy all the time.  But it's one of those hey, we got to have a transparent and open discussion about what the puts and the takes are when we're looking at these programs and how we're funding our research going to the future.  And so that board actually flows out of the Health and Medical Technical Authority.  There's three technical authorities at NASA that were founded after the Columbia accident.  When they were looking at what were the pressures that teams that were looking at the risks and the challenges and the science of what they were doing -- what pressures were they facing just because the agency had goals and they were sometimes pushing on people to meet them, right?    Host: Sure.    Eric Antonson: So what they did was they established three independent reporting lines.  People who had no dog in the fight for actually getting and meeting program schedules.  One of those is an engineering technical authority.  One of them is a safety and mission assurance one.  And the third one is a Health and Medical Technical Authority.  And it derives its power from the chief medical officer and headquarters at NASA.  But the responsibility of that group is look at the risks, look at the evidence base, look across all of these problems and start prioritizing.  Right?  And start making some of those hard decisions about if we're going to make standards that we hold future programs to and requirements about whether or not you're going to have a defibrillator or something else, right, that those -- those things have an open and vigorous debate about the benefits and the costs potentially, the risks of including this and not including that.    Host: Yeah.    Eric Antonson: And so we're always working to try to improve how much information we bring to bear, how we actually communicate, right?  It's very easy for technical people in these fields to speak with jargon and to potentially leave other experts who are, you know, as accomplished in completely different fields sitting there, thinking, like, they're idiots because I don't understand what this person is saying.    Host: Right.    Eric Antonson: So you're talking when we come to these boards, what we're talking about is bringing expertise, and engineering, and spacecraft, and systems engineering together with medical doctors, together with life scientists.  And all of them are speaking their own languages, all right?  It's a big challenge.  So this past year, the former chief medical officer -- guy named Rich Williams from NASA -- actually commissioned a book called the Rosetta Stone.  It's a handbook for trying to get life scientists, fit medical doctors, and engineers to understand each other's perspective and the language they speak in.  Because we're always trying to figure out how do you take people who have a huge amount of insight and understanding in this field over here and get them to understand what the problems are in a different field?  That communication is a massive challenge.    Host: Absolutely.  Oh, I want to check that out, too.  Because that would be probably good across the board just communicating with folks that maybe speak a different language than you.    Eric Antonson: Yeah, we just published that one a couple months ago.    Host: Nice.  Well, focusing on that, now you said you're focusing on human systems risk management, but you also are actively practicing emergency medicine.  So with that comes a certain perspective when it comes to what you bring to the table.  So what are some of the things that you've been bringing to the table recently?    Eric Antonson: So I maintain practice in emergency medicine up at Ben Taub.  I'm professor at Baylor.  And NASA actually buys my services from Baylor as a professor.  The -- my perspective is informed by what do I do in emergency medicine in my practice today?  And maybe even more so, what would I rather have been done so that somebody didn't have to show up in the emergency room, right, the preventative aspect of care?    Host: Captain Hindsight.    Eric Antonson: I get a lot of opportunities to say, \"Man, it would have been great if you would have just done this or known that or, you know, and the system had this sort of thing plugged in.\"    Host: Right.    Eric Antonson: And that's part of it.  The other half of my background is I was a PhD engineer, aerospace engineer in propulsion.  I used to do that for the Air Force Research Laboratory.  So I spent a lot of time both as a medical doctor kind of dealing with the realities of the sickest people that we see in Houston -- Ben Taub is a level one trauma center.  It's a lot of indigenous, immigrant, uninsured population that we deal with there.  So people who have not had the primary and preventive care we would like to see, and therefore they end up in emergency rooms more often than not.  And then I also have spent time as an engineer for spaceflight, looking at how propulsion systems mesh with the larger vehicle systems.  And so when I look at the problem of human system risk, I'm looking at it from the what's the right answer on the medical side hopefully to prevent the problems that I see and deal with in my practice?  But how do you make that jive with the realities of the engineering life cycle of designing a vehicle?  Right?  One of the biggest oversights that the physicians have in the flight surgeon cadre who have never been exposed to an engineering design life cycle is they don't even know what the words mean, right?    Host: [Laughs] Goes over my head.    Eric Antonson: These spacecraft, when you're starting to build a spacecraft, right, you have different phases that engineers all understand -- prephase A, phase A, phase B. You don't actually fly one until you get to phase E. And prephase A can start a decade before you actually build this thing.  Right?    Host: Wow.    Eric Antonson: So when you're actually designing and creating the requirements that a Boeing, or the NASA engineers, or SpaceX, or somebody's going to go build this spaceflight do, you kind of need to know what you need to get it into the mix at least five years and sometimes longer ahead of time.    Host: Wow.    Eric Antonson: Now, contrast that with what happens in the medical world in technology development, right?  All of a sudden we have this explosion of innovation in the medical world.  What we're learning and how we use things like iPhones, which didn't exist when I was in grad school, right, or even in medical school, like, the technology that we are able to bring to bear on understanding the human system just for terrestrial medicine right now is changing so rapidly that if I said, \"I want to use this thing in five years for my medical practice,\" I would be doing my patients in five years a severe disservice.    Host: Right [Laughs].    Eric Antonson: Right?    Host: You can't do it.    Eric Antonson: So now think about the Space Station, right?  It's 2018, we've been having people up there since 2000.  The first module went up in 1998.  The design freezes that occurred for what was going to be included on this vehicle in the year 2018 happened probably three to five years before 1998, right?  I got my first cell phone of any kind in 1998 [Laughs], right?  The ways in which we handle data and expect things from our technology are completely different today than they were then, right?  We don't have automatic means of capturing a lot of information up on the Space Station and the things that we do have are fixes we've made after the fact.  So when we talk about designing something like the Gateway vehicle or, like, what's going to take us to Mars and you're trying to figure out what the right things to include are today, knowing that that mission may not happen for five to ten years, but if you don't actually put placeholders and things in there, then the engineers aren't going to actually keep volume and mass for your stuff, right?   And this is the problem.  What we have on the Space Station today in terms of a medical system is good.  We have an environmental health monitoring system.  We have a health maintenance system, which is some medical kits with equipment and supplies and medicines.  And we have a countermeasure system, which involves exercise equipment that we've changed over time, right?  None of the data from any of those things is connected.  Right now if you wanted to know for your, like, fitness how well you're doing on keeping up with your stuff, you'd use your Apple Watch, or your MyFitnessPal on your phone, or something to track your job in the park.  And you could, like, see how you're doing over time, right?    Host: Yeah.    Eric Antonson: None of that stuff was designed into the Space Station.  But it's an expectation on the data that we have for today in the world that we operate with that we're at least going to have that sort of interoperability with the things that we send on a crew to Mars.  But remember, NASA's been operating and optimizing a system for the last 18 years that hasn't needed that.  So it's actually a shift, a big shift in the way we think about the way we do business in low-earth orbit.  We have put up some things like apps with iPhones and iPads -- not iPhones but iPads.  And sometimes we've learned things that were surprising.  Like, the certificates for the Apple iPad and the apps that they have, they don't -- since they don't have a direct connection to the Cloud, all of a sudden your iPad's going to stop working after a certain amount of time.    Host: Oh.    Eric Antonson: Yeah.  So now you got to accommodate in the networking that you do for the vehicle.  And we still have problems with it.  We've ran into it for the last several years.  It's those type of small problems that we learn in a systems engineering sense and in a data management sense in the Space Station today that we need to make sure don't happen on the way to Mars.  Right?  So we're learning in every aspect.  It's not just how the human body changes but even how we do data, how we set up our networks, how all this stuff talks to each other.  And when we get into that place where we all of a sudden no longer have any real-time communications and you need to put that ultrasound on somebody and go look at their appendix or their kidney or something, and you don't have somebody to guide you and tell you which way to point the probe, you better have included a learning module that shows them how and where to look and how to interpret the images.    Host: Yeah.  So being conscious of your time, I'm just going to ask you one more thing: If you had to take something -- just based on what we've discussed today -- and let's say we have a long-term presence on the moon, some folks that are practicing some of these things that we need to explore further out into the solar system, Mars being one of the destinations, what are some of the things that you are looking forward to trying on the moon?    Eric Antonson: So there's a giant list.     [ Laughter ]  Part of it is actually managing the data that we have and learning how to do that with a different ground support model than we currently have today.  Because those are the first steps of what's going to enable us to change from the ISS paradigm and the everything readily available paradigm over to something that's going to be appropriate to going to Mars.  That's one way that we learn to do the mix of monitoring the human system that we worry about, along with making sure that we can be supportive in whatever ways we can be.  Another thing is we don't have a dose response curve for gravity and what happens with the human body.  Right?  Those T-cells that I told you about declining?    Host: Yeah.    Eric Antonson: I don't know if that's isolation, stress, radiation, microgravity, right?  You put somebody on the moon, all of a sudden you have a data point at one-sixth gravity, right?  We don't know the neurovestibular changes that happen.  We don't know how long they're going to last when you go into one-sixth gravity.  We don't know how well the body's going to accommodate in one-sixth gravity compared to microgravity, right?  Or three-eighths at Mars, right?  So part of spending time on the surface of the moon from the perspective of the human and how we change is starting to get another data point somewhere between no gravity and the three-eighths gravity that we expect on Mars.  And right now all we've got is 1G and zero, right?  So that's a really amazing opportunity to start collecting data in a partial gravity environment and start building that dose response curve to what happens to the whole accommodation, right?  You've heard of the sands problem, sometimes called VIP, where they have the eyeball changes, and some astronauts have had changes in their vision and need to wear glasses and that sort of thing?   How's that going to change when you put partial loading back on the body?  When you actually have the fluids in the body pulled back down again.  But maybe not that much, right?  It's a whole new set point for adaptation that we're not going to understand that until we spend some time there doing it, right?  We didn't have enough chance in the '70s when we were at the moon to really start kind of gauging those questions.    Host: Right, they were camping trips.    Eric Antonson: We've got basic functionality, right?  Can we do this?  Can you walk around?  What happens if you fall over, right?  And also we learned that astronauts would hurt themselves in creative ways [Laughs].  You know, when we do our modeling for the loads that people experience and we're worried about hey, are these guys to break their bones because of the changes in their bone density and stuff like that?  Most of the modeling of loads that we would expect to be applied says no, it's too low of a load in these gravitational fields.  And yet one of the astronauts, you know, managed to go out there, get a piece of equipment stuck in the ground, and then trying to get it out, stuck his shoulder up underneath it and really hurt himself pushing up against it, right?  It's those sort of things that oh, I didn't know that person was going to do that.  I probably should be aware of that and take that into concern or into my calculations for what I provide, right?  [Laughs] It could be anything from, like, potentially fracturing a bone to pulling a muscle, to just having a bruise.  We don't know, but it sort of reminds us that when we think we have solutions and we think we have answers, humans have a wonderful way of surprise us.    Host: Yeah.  It's those extra data points that are really going to be -- really going to help us out.  But then just learning along the way, what questions do we still need to ask?    Eric Antonson: Yeah.  Right now we're comfortable with the evacuation times we have from the Space Station.  What happens when we're living in that domain where it takes three days?  How do we change the way we view medicine?  How do we change the way we view prevention?  How do we change the way that we support our crews as we get farther and farther away from Earth?  As that distance increases, the question marks just multiple.  So that's one more set of data points and ways in which we can start to understand the real impact of that hazard, which is distance from Earth.    Host: I can't wait to find out.    Eric Antonson: Me, too.    Host: Eric, thanks for coming on the podcast today and sharing your perspective on what it takes to go far, far away.    Eric Antonson: I appreciate you having me.  Thank you.     [ Music ]    Host: Hey, thanks for sticking around.  So today we talked with Dr. Eric Antonson.  We talked about being far from Earth, the distance from Earth, and all the challenges that come with it.  This is part of our series of the five hazards of human space flight.  We've had several podcast episodes so far -- two down, I guess this is our third, and two more to go.  We are actually partnering with the Human Research Program to do this series.  So they have a video series and animations that are paired with each of these episodes.  You can go to NASA.gov/hrp to see those videos and the content that's supplemented with these five hazards and the three that we've done so far.  For the International Space Station, you can go to NASA.gov/iss.  A lot of the research we talked about today is on board the International Space Station.  So you can go to that website to find out some of the research going on there.  Otherwise you can follow us on social media.  It's Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram for the International Space Station or the NASA Johnson Space Center accounts.  Go to those, whatever platform is your favorite, and use the hashtag #AskNASA to submit an idea for the show.   Just make sure to mention it's for Houston, We Have a Podcast and we might make a whole episode out of it.  So this podcast was recorded on June 28th, 2018.  Thanks to Alex Perryman, Pat Ryan, Bill Stafford, Nell Whiting, Bill Pulaski, Judy Hayes, [inaudible], Mel Whiting, and [inaudible].  Thanks again to Eric Antonson for coming on the show.  We'll be back next week with the fourth of the five hazards of human space flight, discussing altered gravity fields.  See you then."

                        "description": "Gary Jordan (Host): Houston, We Have a Podcast.  Welcome to the official podcast of the NASA Johnson Space Center, Episode 69: Navigating Deep Space.  I'm Gary Jordan, and I'll be your host today.  On this podcast, we bring in the experts.  NASA scientists, engineers, and astronauts.  All to let you know the cool stuff about what's going on right here at NASA.  So if you're familiar with us, you may have heard our episode on space communication networks.  It was Episode 26: Can you hear me now?  With Bill Foster, a ground controller.  It was a really good conversation.  And it was a nice overview on how space communication networks work in general.  Especially with day-to-day operations on the International Space Station.  But today we're focusing how space communications will work on missions out in deep space.  We're talking with Greg Holt, Orion Navigation Lead here at NASA's Johnson Space Center.  We talked about how Orion, NASA's deep space vehicle, will communicate with Mission Control.  All the way from the moon and beyond.  And also what happens if a primary communication system fails.  So with no further delay, let's jump right ahead to our talk with Dr. Greg Holt.  Enjoy.    [ Music ]    Host: Thank you for coming on the podcast today, Greg.  Nice to have you here.    Dr. Greg Holt: Great to be here, Gary.  Thanks.    Host: I love this topic of communication and navigation too.  Because a lot of the space movies today.  You see them, and there's always something that goes wrong in the space movie.  It's, it makes for a great narrative.  It makes for a great story.  But it's always that lack of communication.  And oh no!  I'm an astronaut, I'm by myself now.  It's that sort of thing.  And so this is an interesting topic on to see how this is going to work.  Because we're talking about Orion.  And we're talking about deep space today.  So let's just kind of start with that.  Let's talk with, we're talking about navigation.  We're talking about communication with a deep space craft.  How does basic communication and navigation with the spacecraft work?    Dr. Greg Holt: So that's a great question.  And you know we've all seen those same movies.  And us and the crew.  And so we also spend a lot of time sitting around thinking about what do we do to make sure we don't lose communication?  And then boy on those very bad days when we do, what is the crew supposed to do about it?    Host: Right.    Dr. Greg Holt: But you know on a normal day out in deep space, we're normally talking through.  As you mentioned, there's a Deep Space Network out there.  That's managed by our colleagues over at Jet Propulsion Laboratory in California.  And they've been, had that running for decades now.  And use it for a variety of interplanetary spacecraft.  And so once we really get outside of our comfort zone around kind of lower-earth orbit.  That Deep Space Network becomes our lynchpin for communication out there.    Host: So there's several space networks then.  There's the Deep Space Network which is communicating with all these different robotic probes that we have all across the solar system.  And that's the primary, I guess network that we're using for those, right?  But there's one that exists around here.  What's, what's going on around earth?    Dr. Greg Holt: There is.  There's a Near Earth Network.  And that consists of a number of ground-based dishes that communicate with satellites in low-earth orbit.  And then of course there's the TDRS or the Tracking and Data Relay Satellite constellation.  That is up in a geosynchronous orbit that's also communicating with satellites that are in the proximity of earth.  In that near, low-earth orbit area.  But again, once you get outside there, you're really back on the Deep Space Network.  And you have to use those bigger, more capable dishes to talk out there so.    Host: Right, because those TDRS satellites are geosynchronous, right?  So they're 20--, 22--, 23,000 miles I think away from earth.  So once you, I mean, that's, it sounds pretty far.  You've got a pretty decent snapshot of earth.  But once you cross it, I mean, they're not, they're not talking to that spacecraft.    Dr. Greg Holt: That's right.  And it sounds like a long way.  But when we're zooming, for example, out to the moon.  Really only in contact really for the first 15, 20 minutes or so.  Maybe 30 minutes if we're lucky on the way out.  But then we've really got to start handing over to that Deep Space Network because it's a long way to the moon.  And our, we travel fast, getting through that very first low-earth orbit phase.    Host: Oh wow.  So you're talking about after that, I guess it's called, it's referred to in all the old space movies TLI, right?  Trans-lunar injection?  That's that final burn that gets you, once you're circling earth.    Dr. Greg Holt: You got it.    Host: Boom!  You burn, and you're on your way.  So that's, you say that's about 15, 20 minutes until their trans-lunar injection.  Until bam!  You're, you're passing the TDRS satellites?    Dr. Greg Holt: It's, it's really fast out there.  It's a lot faster than most of us anticipate.    Host: Yeah!    Dr. Greg Holt: And the very first time that we simulate that for all of our ground control folks.  It always catches us by surprise how quickly we zip through the GPS constellation, the TDRS constellation.  We're just going through all of those.  And we're really out there on our own.  Having to look back at the Deep Space Network in very short order so.    Host: So what's the GPS constellation?  Is that, is that another network?    Dr. Greg Holt: Yeah, that's Global Positioning System. They’re the same satellites that you communicate with like your, your car or your smartphone.    Host: Oh, we all need that.    Dr. Greg Holt: Exactly.  That at that we receive, we receive that signal from those Global Positioning satellites.  Lets us navigate our cars all over the place.  Tell us exactly where we are when we're carrying our phones around.  We could use that.  Of course, our spacecraft as well when we're relatively close to the earth.  But once we, again, get too far away.  Then that Global Positioning System also is out of range.  And we've really got to go back to some of the more old-school methods of navigation using radio signals.  And as you'll talk about, even some star, star sightings, things of that nature.    Host: Oh, radio signals.  I want to definitely get into that.  That'd be pretty cool.  So these networks.  We have, we have GPS, we have TDRS, Deep Space Network.  Do we have complete control over these networks?  Or is this a shared resource?    Dr. Greg Holt: You know, all of those are really shared resources.  And the, both the, especially the Near Earth Network is shared amongst a lot of users.  Both from a NASA standpoint.  And Department of Defense all kind of shares that resources.  And both contribute to its upkeep.  And so we do have to share that resource quite a bit.  The Deep Space Network is mainly NASA projects on there.  But again, there's enough of them they al-- that also has to be shared and scheduled quite a bit in advance.  And so lots of times we'll have to schedule that months in advance.  In fact, that time to be on the Deep Space Network just because there's so many probes.  There's New Horizon's out at Pluto.  And there's other probes at Mars.  And there's other vehicles near the sun.  They're all wanting to communicate with that Deep Space Network.  And so we have to schedule that resource well in advance.  And we try to be collegial about it.  And make sure that we respect when everybody has critical science going on.  Versus obviously for a human spaceflight vehicle, we want to make sure that we have good coverage with our vehicle.  Keep it safe, so.    Host: That's right because obviously, if you're flying Orion, you want communication with Orion.  But that doesn't mean you're going to completely dominate all the communication and nobody else can talk to their spacecraft.  Because everyone's, everyone's got stuff going on.    Dr. Greg Holt: You're exactly right.  And in general, when we have people onboard, we tend to get a little bit higher priority.  But we try not to abuse that.  Because we again, we realize the Deep Space Network is a shared asset.  And we want, you know, we want to make sure that we're not adversely affecting.  The science payloads and the rovers and the unmanned probes out there.  As, as much as possible.    Host: Okay.  So when it comes to deep space craft, I guess.  We’ll talk about Orion.  But when it comes to communication and navigation.  What are you looking for?  What kind of data are we looking at?  Why do we want to communicate?    Dr. Greg Holt: So communication and navigation interestingly are pretty interdependent functions.  They're, you know separate but they're, but they're very related and interdependent.  One of the reasons is that they both use the same radio signal to accomplish their task.  So that same radio signal that we're using to talk to the spacecraft, get data from the spacecraft.  We're also, we're also encoding navigation information on that radio signal and using it to actually locate the spacecraft as well.  So it's kind of a, it's kind of a two-fer.  We get to piggyback one function on another.  But for that reason, they become very, very related and interdependent.  And obviously the importance of being able to communicate with the spacecraft is we want to be able to talk to the crew.  And make sure they can talk back to the ground for the normal interactions that we need to have with them.  We also need to make sure of course we're getting data back from the vehicle.   And all the telemetry on all the systems.  So that the ground controllers and Mission Control can look at the spacecraft systems.  Make sure they're all functioning properly.  And then one of the last and most, what I think is one of the more important things, is we want to make sure we get some cool pictures down from the spacecraft.  Because you know we've got a very unique spacecraft out there in a region of space where we haven't been in a very long time.  So getting some cool, some cool videos down from around the moon.  I think is a pretty good task, too.    Host: Definitely looking forward to those pictures.  For sure.  Especially if they're high resolution, too.  Are we looking at that?    Dr. Greg Holt: We are.  So right now the system that we've got, for example, on Orion.  Gives us about two, two megabits per second at its highest rate.  So that's, that's plenty good for some compressed HD video.  That takes about one and a half megabits.  So, so in our, when we've got the times allocated for it and the time slots, we'll turn those HD cameras on and get some really cool shots, I think.  Coming, coming to us from the vicinity of the moon.  And we've got some unique cameras at different locations around the Orion spacecraft, out on the tips of the solar rays that can swivel around and take some neat shots of the spacecraft out there, while it's navigating to and from the moon.    Host: Now I'm thinking about it, just from watching it on TV.  How pretty it's going to look.  But I'm sure that there's an engineering part to that, too.  As a, as a, you're saying you've got folks on the ground that are receiving this telemetry and data about the spacecraft.  Numbers can tell you so much.  But a good picture can probably tell you a decent amount as an engineer, too.    Dr. Greg Holt: It does.  And not only does it tell us about the health of the spacecraft.  But it also, especially for the first couple of flights, gives us some really good engineering data about what's going on with the spacecraft.  And if there's anything that we need to look at either tweaking the design or even fixing the design for future missions.  So for example, we see that one side of the spacecraft isn't, isn't behaving well.  Or the, we're getting back pictures that show that we didn't separate cleanly from some piece of the spacecraft where we were supposed to have a separation event.  Then we'll go back and look at that picture in excruciating detail.  And watch that video in super slow motion thousands of time and make sure that we really understand what was going on.  And what we need to, what we need to tweak in the design.    Host: Yeah, so that's when that higher resolution and that the more data you're getting, the better your assessment can be.  Because the more you can see and play with that footage.  So that's always good.  You were talking about radio signals and, and it being kind of sharing this, this feature of communication and navigation.  Interdependent but two separate things.  Navigation, I don't think we've actually dove into navigation too much on the podcast before.  So, so how does a, how does a spacecraft navigate?  How does it know where to go?    Dr. Greg Holt: Very good question, and the answer really depends on where you are relative to the earth.  So right when we're sitting on the pad, obviously, we have a really good idea of where we are.  Because.    Host: Well, you can see it.  [Laughter]    Dr. Greg Holt: We can see it, and it's sitting right there on the pad.  And so at that point, we have absolute certainty of where the vehicle is.    Host: Cool.    Dr. Greg Holt: But then once we, once we get launched and get further up and then get into our low earth orbit, that's where we really lean heavily on Global Positioning Systems.  So that GPS signal just like you get in your car, your smartphone.  And it's, like I said, it works really well when you're close to the earth.  And we have four antennas and two GPS receivers on Orion.  And we get really good signal there.  And we have a really good idea of where Orion is.  But then after we do that, the big, the big burn.  The, the TLI, trans-lunar injection you were talking about.  We zip out rapidly past that GPS constellation there.  It's only about 12 and a half thousand miles out there.  So really again, we're zipping past it in the first few minutes of the outbound trajectory on the way to the moon.  And then we have to switch to, like I said, some of the more old-school methods of navigation.  And so this is where we go back to using those encoded radio sig-- encoded information on the radio signals to, to navigate.  Just we did back in the Apollo days.   And then they still use that today for deep space probes.  So that method of navigating using that encoded information on the radio signal has actually been refined very well by our JPL colleagues out there since Apollo.  And so we're going to take full advantage of course of all the advancements that they've made.  Both in the ground-side equipment and the onboard radio transponder equipment.  Over the past couple of decades.  And really gives us a nice modern communication system with upgraded avionics compared to Apollo that makes our job just that much easier.  Navigating the spacecraft and telling where it is from the ground.  By looking at the signature of those radio signals.    Host: Yeah, so it sounds like, I mean, the, for that little while that the spacecraft is actually close to earth, GPS.  It sounds like when it comes to navigation, you're talking about GPS.  You're talking about radio.  But really the theme here is that you really want to know the location of, of the spacecraft.  Is that, is that like the main component of understanding how navigation works?  Is understanding where the spacecraft is?    Dr. Greg Holt: That's one part of it.  But the other important parts from our prospective not only is where is the spacecraft.  But what direction is it going and how fast?  So the spacecraft's velocity is very important to us.  And then the spacecraft's orientations.  All three of those play into the navigator's job of keeping track of where it is, where it's going, what direction it's pointing.  And how all of those things affect.  So we go to great lengths to estimate all those things continuously during the mission so that we can always be prepared.  To supply that information to the folks who are calculating the burns, for example.  All the maneuvering burns at so that they know which direction that we need to do course corrections.  All those things rely fundamentally on that navigation.  Knowing where the vehicle is, its velocity and its orientation so that we can do all the fancy math behind the scenes that gets us where we need to go.    Host: So I think when it comes to navigating a craft in space.  It's not like what you see in sci-fi movies where there's someone with a joystick and they're just kind of weaving in and out of space, right?  I think this, when it comes to deep space navigation.  A lot of it is preplanned.  So it's, it's knowing the velocity at this point in the trajectory, in the mission.  It's supposed to be going this fast at this place and oriented this way.  Is that kind of how that works?    Dr. Greg Holt: Very much.    Host: Okay.    Dr. Greg Holt: We plan a lot of that ahead of time.  And we have a very detailed reference trajectory before we ever start the mission.    Host: Okay.    Dr. Greg Holt: But inevitably, especially with a crew vehicle.  You're going to slightly get off of that preplanned reference trajectory due to things.  You know, all of the events that happen onboard, especially a spacecraft with a crew.  The crew is constantly breathing for example.  And that's a good thing.  We like the crew to breath.  But that also means that carbon dioxide and things are constantly being vented overboard.  We have things such as water and urine dumps that we have to deal with.  So a lot of things that for example, that robotic spacecraft don't have to deal with.  For a vehicle with people inside, we do have to deal with these, these events, these overboard events that do perturb the trajectory slightly.  And so we have to keep track of those things.  And that's a lot of what our job is as navigators on, for human spaceflight missions.  Is that we're constantly keeping track of these small perturbations that accumulate over the course of the trajectory.  And then using that to help feed that into what we need to do.  As far as make course correction burns to get us back on track and keep us on, keep us on the mission.    Host: Knowing, yeah.  Knowing the navigation where you're supposed to be at what time.  But I guess another thing, another consideration is, is fuel and thrust, you know?  You can't just be firing the jets all the time.  You have a certain amount of fuel for these deep space missions that, that you have.    Dr. Greg Holt: It is, and we have those preplanned points usually during the trajectory where we have those mid-course corrections sort of scripted into the mission, if you will.  Such that every so often we will evaluate how we're doing.  Based on all of those navigation measurements that we've taken to that point.  And say okay, it looks like we're off by this much.  So we need to correct our trajectory back by this much.  We'll prescribe a burn.  We'll upload that to the vehicle.  And the crew will monitor it as it goes, as it happens.    Host: So that's kind of interesting that just venting CO2 or if you need to go to bathroom and you need to let go some of the urine, right?  That's Orion.  Orion's not going to use this water recycling system.  You're just going to dump it overboard.  But just that little bit is enough to push a spacecraft.  That's just amazing how that, how space works like that.    Dr. Greg Holt: It is.  And again, we, we love having humans on board spacecraft.  But from a navigator's prospective, sometimes we pull our hair out because those are the things that we have to deal with.  Is these, all these little overboard dumps really cause these perturbations to accumulate.  And we have to cause our job of keeping track of a vehicle to be that much more challenging.    Host: So another thing you were talking about was, was orientation of the spacecraft.  Again, I'm, I, I keep thinking about sci-fi movies here.  But you're not talking about a spacecraft just kind of zipping through.  You don't really have to deal with aerodynamics as much like a plains is shaped away.  Because you're flying through the air.  This one, you can sort of face in any direction.  But I'm sure there's some strategy on which direction you want to be facing.  So what's the orientation of the spacecraft when it's flying?    Dr. Greg Holt: So we have a lot of different orientations that we use.  And we'll use different, different prescribed orientations of the vehicle for different purposes.  And one of the ones that we like for Orion specifically is what's called that tail to sun orientation or attitude.    Host: Tail to sun.  Dr. Greg Holt: And that's where we basically turn the vehicle around, point the back end right there at the sun.  So that lines up our solar rays right there at the sun.  Gives us nice, good power consumption.  Keeps the, all the components at just about the right thermal, thermal temperature, balance.  So we have some electronics are a little bit more sensitive to temperature than others so that tail to sun orientation or attitude, as we call it.  Keeps those, keeps the hot things hot.  Keeps the cool things cool.  And keeps the solar rays pointed right there where we get good power generation and distribution throughout the vehicle.    Host: So that's a key component of orientation is not, you're not pointing where you want to be flying.  You're pointing to where you're getting a good amount of power consumption.  But also you're protecting the systems from the intense, I guess thermal constraints of space.  It's super hot when the sun is shining on it.  And in the shade it can be super cold.    Dr. Greg Holt: That's right.  And we use, we have two star trackers on the vehicle that help us determine which direction the vehicle is pointing.  So they're actually constantly looking out at stars.  Recognizing the different stars and the different constellations and orientations.  And constantly computing automatically on board what the, what direction the vehicle is pointing.  And we're constantly feeding that to our guidance navigation and control system on board.  Which is actively keeping the vehicle oriented just in the direction that we prescribe.  So it's a fairly complicated feedback loop of things that have to happen just to keep the vehicle pointed in one direction.  But-- .    Host: Wow. Yeah, I guess that's true, right?  Because if, if I'm in my car, I want to turn left.  I know that I'm going to orient.  I'm going to turn the wheel, the car's going to go left.  But this all different directions in space.  So the place that you want to orient is based on where the stars are.    Dr. Greg Holt: Exactly.  Host: So you have to know where the stars are going to be at this time in this place.  And which way-- wow.  That's so interesting.  They're looking at the stars.    Dr. Greg Holt: We really are.  That's the, we're getting back to some of the more old-school methods of navigation once you get beyond, too far beyond earth orbit there, you really have to use the stars to figure out your orientation.  And then the stars of course become important if you happen to lose communication.  And that radio link with the earth.  That's, the stars become the only way to know where you are.    Host: Yeah, so that's, that's the orientation.  That's the method we use for orientation is, is knowing the stars.  You talked about old-school method of, of radio.  And that being a way to, to navigate the spacecraft past whenever we're past the GPS constellation.  So how does that work?  How does a radio communication work?    Dr. Greg Holt: So that's that, where I was talking about, we put that signal onto the communication link.  So the communication link for Orion operates on an S-Band radio frequency.  And so what we'll do is we'll encode some navigation information onto the S-Band radio signal.  And it's transparent to the vehicle.  It just goes back and forth.  But on the ground, we can actually take that signal and do some special post-processing to it.  And actually extract a measurement from that.  So it actually measures you know the range to the vehicle or the relative velocity of the vehicle to that receiving dish.  And so we can actually then take those measurements and plug those into our navigation filters and estimate where the vehicle is and what its velocity is.  Just based on that information that's encoded on the radio signal.    Host: Wow, but it's obviously pretty reliable because we've had spacecraft like you said.  All over the solar system, flying in all different directions and going exactly where they need to go.  So it's, so it's a pretty reliable navigation tool.    Dr. Greg Holt: It is, and that's been around really since the early days of human spaceflight.  So even all the way back to the very first satellite in fact, Sputnik.  They were able to track its radio signal and do some very crude post-processing on it.  And figure out its velocity and orbit within a few hours.  Some of the, some of the first folks that tracked that.  Of course the Mercury and Gemini flights refined that.  And then the Apollo engineers designed the, the universal S-Band system specifically for Apollo.  They had all of those pieces.  The communication navigation all integrated together into one nice, tight little package.  And really did a great job for them.  And really was kind of the precursor to all of the modern communication navigation equipment that we use today on spacecraft.    Host: Wow, you're not kidding when you say old school.  You're talking about using radio as navigation from the first steps of space flight in general.    Dr. Greg Holt: Absolutely.    Host: Wow, that's some significant stuff.  From what you're, from what you're talking about.  When it comes to navigating a spacecraft.  It seems like a lot of it is done with computers and a lot of it is done and monitored on the ground.  How much are the crew doing?  They're not really, it doesn't sound like they're doing a lot of flying.    Dr. Greg Holt: So that's a good point.  During the, the normal course of the mission.  They're obviously just sort of keeping track where the vehicle is.  They're up, they're usually very curious to know how far away am I from earth?  How far do I have to go to the moon?  So those type of questions always come up and so we keep that navigation information handy for them.  But primarily the, the navigation function is accomplished on the ground.  Because we have those measurements taken from the radio signal.  And of course we have the computers that actually crunch the numbers and figure out where they are.  Where the crew does come into play though is if we do happen to lose communication with the ground.  And that's where we spend a lot of our time and effort thinking about those bad-day scenarios.  But you know that's the, the type of things that we have to think through and what is the crew supposed to do if they lose communication with the ground?  That radio signal is obviously not there.  So that's where we have to fall to our, to our backup systems of navigation.  That are completely self-contained on board the vehicle.  And that's where they use things such as our optical navigation camera.  And some of these back-up systems where in the, the very unlikely event that we should lose communication with the ground.  We don't want the crew to be stranded and have no hope of getting back.  So we include those, we have those back-up systems.  We train them how to use them.  And that's where the crew becomes super involved and very interested in making sure the spacecraft is navigated correctly.    Host: Okay.  So, so they're not, they don't have their hands at a joystick.  And they're not flying left and right.  They're really just kind of monitoring things.  And you guys are, too.  As long as everything is going according to plan.    Dr. Greg Holt: Right.    Host: Their expertise is when stuff goes wrong.    Dr. Greg Holt: Exactly.    Host: And you talked about optical navigation.  Is it, I mean, you, if, I'm thinking orientation.  I'm thinking about the stars.  How, how do they optically navigate?  How does that work?    Dr. Greg Holt: So this is probably taking it even one more step back into the old school where we've lost that radio link, as I mentioned.  And, and now we have to really navigate by the stars.  And this is going, you know, Christopher Columbus type old school where you have to literally take sightings of the stars.  Sightings of the moon.  Measure angles between them.  And try to deduce from those measurements and triangulate your position in the earth-moon space.  And so it gets from a navigator's perspective, it's very cool and exciting because you know that's a, that's a neat way to navigate.    Host: Yeah, it's pretty cool.    Dr. Greg Holt: But it, it definitely requires some more, some trickier math and some trickier vehicle design to pull that off.  So we have a camera that does that automatically.  And so if they do lose communication with the ground.  That camera system kicks in.  Starts taking pictures of the moon and stars.  And automatically deducing where it is based on the size of the, relative size of the moon.  Where it is in relation to the background stars.  Because the stars can be considered like a fixed target.  And then the moon is kind of moving around as you navigate to and from the moon.  The moon will appear to move around against the fixed background of stars.  So you can infer where you are based on using some really, like I said, some old school triangulation methods.  To, to get you where your, your position and velocity and continue to navigate the spacecraft.  And pull off those midcourse maneuvers and things that you need.  To actually get you back safely.    Host: Oh, okay.  So, so they're not really busting out the old Christopher Columbus, I forget what the device is called, a sextant device?  What's the, the little navigation thing?    Dr. Greg Holt: Right, right, So those, those old mechanical instruments that you see?  Well, truth be told as an emergency backup.  We at least have it on the, we're evaluating it right now.  That in a really, really bad day situation.    Host: If the back-up fails.    Dr. Greg Holt: Where they might, they will potentially carry one of those along as well.  We actually have an experiment on International Space Station right now.  Where the crew is actually has a sextant up there.  A real marine sextant.  Just like you would see out at sea today.  And they are practicing taking measurements from the International Space Station.  And they're really doing a great job.  Matter of fact, I was just on the, on the loops with them this morning.  I was talking with, with the crew members up there.  Coaching them through a session of taking sextant measurements out the, out the window.  And they're really doing a great job.  They, they actually really like it.  It's, it's really, I think they feel a kind of a connection to some of the old-school techniques there.  In some of the, the ghosts of the sailors past whispering over their shoulder to, helping them make, helping them make good measurements.    Host: Yeah, you feel like a classic explorer.    2 >> Indeed.  Indeed.  But you know it's, it's interesting.  It's an interesting concept because you know it's one of those situations that you, you don't want to, you hope never happens.  But you know in a, in a very bad-day scenario where your computers are down.  And, and a lot of your back-up systems have failed.  It's nice in a, for a last-ditch emergency to just to have a nice, solid mechanical piece of equipment that doesn't require a fancy computer or anything like that, that you can just pull out and at least keep track of where you are.  And give yourself a fighting chance to get back home.    Host: Yeah.  That's crazy.  A back-up to a back-up.  Because you had this system that does a lot of, even, even in the case where you would lose that navigation ability.  You do have a back-up.  Then you have a back-up to that.  That's pretty crazy.  Now in this, in this scenario where they lose, in the first one.  Where they lose communication and they're using this back-up system that automatically detects where they are.  Are they sending the commands?  Or in this scenario, do they still have communication with the ground?  And communicating where and when to fire things?    Dr. Greg Holt: So this is a situation where we have lost communication with the ground.  So the, the onboard systems now are taking those pictures.  Continuing to navigate completely within the vehicle.  So not relying on any external assets there.  So we're just relying on those photos that we're taking to determine where the vehicle is and where it's going.    Host: Okay.    Dr. Greg Holt: And then the vehicle also has the onboard targeting systems to take that navigation solution.  And turn that into a burn to get them back on course.  To get them back to earth.  So again, a lot of that is all scripted and happens automatically.    Host: Cool.    Dr. Greg Holt: But when communication with the ground is lost.  There's nobody on the ground monitoring to make sure all of that is working correctly.  So that's where the crew member comes in.  They now take over the function of watching all of those automating systems.  Making sure that they're all behaving correctly.  Doing their job correctly.  And that if anything, if it throws any warning flags or has any problems.  They're the ones who have to go in and diagnose and fix things.  And so that's where we spend a lot of our time training the crew.  Making them aware of what to look for.  When these automated functions are occurring.  They have to have the expertise to monitor them.  And go in and take action if there's, if there's a problem.    Host: Wow, that's, that seems to be a theme when it comes to crew training is you know what happens when something goes wrong?  You've got to know.  And that's, like you said,  if you're spending a lot of time on it.  And that's, that's the truth because when it comes down to it.  When it comes down to crunch time.  You know, something goes wrong, we have to make sure we're going the right direction.  That is extremely important because you're on your own.  You've got to have that baseline knowledge.  You don't have, you can't just you know, search it up.  Or call someone on the ground.  Like you have to know.    Dr. Greg Holt: It is.  And like I say, we—it seems like we spend an inordinate amount out of time thinking through these scenarios and preparing the crew for when we lose communication.  But it, it's, it's a big enough deal and it's a big enough concern to the crew.  Because that's a, just thinking from a psychological point of view.  That's a, that's a pretty, pretty harrowing experience to have to go through.  To lose your safety net.  Your communication signal with the ground.  The ability to talk to someone and understand that you're still on track.  And everything's okay.  And so that, that not being there is a really, a big psychological hit to the crew.  So the more that we can prepare them to understand if you lose communication with the ground, you can still look here and monitor everything.  See that you're still on, on good trajectory.  You're still going to make your entry corridor and everything's going to be okay.  You know, that's a big, that's a big deal.  Not just you know from a mission success standpoint.  But also from a psychological standpoint for the crew.    Host: Yeah, for sure.  I'm thinking about some of the first missions of, of Orion, EM-1, EM-2.  I'm thinking about those mission profiles.  And I know Orion is going to be sent.  Those missions are, are to the moon, right?    Dr. Greg Holt: Right.  Host: So, so you're going to be going that way.  Trans-lunar injection.  That's why it's called that, so you can go around the moon.  Now from what I understand from Apollo missions.  Once you get behind the moon, that's where communication gets a little bit tricky.  I think you lose communications.  Is that part of the mission plan?    Dr. Greg Holt: We do lose communication briefly and that's expected.    Host: I see.    Dr. Greg Holt: And so we plan ahead of time that we're going to have a few minutes of brief communication outage behind the moon.  The unfortunate thing, at least from our flight-controller ground perspective is that a lot of critical events are happening during that very brief time.    Host: Really?  Dr. Greg Holt: And that's just, just the way that the orbital mechanics work out.  Host: Okay.  Dr. Greg Holt: So for example, some of our-- if we're trying to, if for example insert into a, a big halo orbiter distant retrograde orbit around the moon, we have to execute that burn just in that spot where we have that lost communication.  Right behind the moon.  And so we don't get to monitor that burn and monitor the telemetry and the data from that burn in real time.  We have to wait until the burn happens.  And then we see it come out from behind the moon.  We get our data and telemetry back and then we can tell after the fact.  Whether the burn worked or not.  But we don't actually get to see it right during, during the burn.  So that gets a little bit of, a little bit of a harrowing time.  And that's where it's nice to have a crew onboard.  They can be obviously right there monitoring the burn.  If there's any problems that happen during the burn, they can take immediate action.  As opposed to the ground.  Which won't be able to see the burn or take action until many minutes later.    Host: So in this, in this scenario, you're going behind the moon.  You're doing that burn.  Is that, is that burn to circle around the moon and come back?  Or what, what's, what's happening in the, in the mission profile?  Where's it going?    Dr. Greg Holt: So that's, depends on the, where you're, if you're going inbound or outbound.  So on the way out, we're generally trying to capture into some sort of a lunar orbit so we can stay there for, for a little while and conduct the mission.  And so that first burn is usually to capture you into lunar orbit.    Host: And that happens behind the moon?    Dr. Greg Holt: Right.  That happens behind the moon.  And then at the end of the mission, when it's time to come home.  We do kind of a reverse where we come back.  But again, we have to do another burn to get us back on a trajectory back to the earth.    Host: Behind the moon.    Dr. Greg Holt: Again, behind the moon and--   Host: I'm seeing a theme here.    Dr. Greg Holt: The poor crew has to again, has to pull that one off or at least monitor it on their own.  We precalculate it on the ground and get everything set up for them.  But you know they're, they have to monitor it on the ground.  I mean on the spacecraft.  And then the ground will pick them up on, on the flipside when they come out on the side of the moon.  And do a quick radio track from the Deep Space Network.  And confirm that everything went off okay.  And give them, give them the go to continue on home.    Host: Wow, no kidding, important stuff going on behind the moon there.  Wow.  Yeah, so definitely something that you want to know.  But it sounds like when you, when you come around the moon, you understand, based on whenever you get that signal back.  It went successfully or it did not go successfully.  Are you getting some-- is it recording data behind the moon, moon too?  So that whenever you regain communication, you can understand exactly what happened?    Dr. Greg Holt: Yes, absolutely.  So we, we have our data recorders going the whole time.  Once we get back communications, we'll set up a, just a file transfer link.  And record all that data down to the ground.  Double check and make sure that the burn executed successfully.  But you know, one of the very first and early indications that we get.  And even the Apollo guys used this trick.  Is actually just monitoring what time we get communication back.  So you know our, our flight dynamics officers there in Mission Control are, are so good at their job.  They can usually predict down to the second or two when we're going to get communication back.  So if the burn didn't go exactly as planned.  It was either didn't, it was either too cold or too hot, didn't add enough energy or added too much.  The communication will even hap, the return of communication will either happen too early or too late.  And so if we're, if we're a little early getting communication back or a little late getting communication back.  Then that'll give us a very first heads-up.  Hey, something didn't go right with that burn.  But if we get it back right on time, that at least gives us our, our very first indication.  Yep, we're right, right on the money.  We got comm back right when we expected.  And then like I said, we'll do a quick radio track just to confirm.  But.    Host: Yeah.  So it sounds like for, for a lot of this you, in, in your position, are you working pretty closely with the operations folks?  And because it sounds like a lot of this is, is dealing with, you know, operate, operating the spacecraft.  And understanding the navigation of, of yeah, the mission itself.    Dr. Greg Holt: It is, and we have a really great team here that is participating in both the design and the operations of Orion.   Host: I see. Okay.  Dr. Greg Holt: And we work very closely together on a daily basis, really.  Because we're very sensitive to the fact as vehicle designers that the folks who operate this vehicle are going to have to know exactly what to do with it.  And so we try to do design operability into the vehicle wherever we can.  And of course they're, as operators, they're sensitive to the fact that they want all the bells and whistles on, on a vehicle.  And we, we always have to be sensitive to how much, how much mass everything adds to the vehicle.  How much power it consumes.  And so we have to play that balancing game between, you know, both the crew.  And, and the flight controllers.  You know, want the, the greatest gee-whiz system they can, they can put on there.  Which is great.  But weighs a million pounds and.  [Laughter]  And consumes, you know, thousand watts of power.  And so we can't, sorry we can't, can't put all that on there.  So we, we do have to play those, those system trade games to make sure that we have a vehicle that's, that's operable and the crew can understand.  But still can get off the launchpad so.    Host: Right, yeah.  Orion would be pretty huge if everyone got what they wanted.  Right?  So alright.  So let's talk about Orion itself.  You know, when it comes to the navigation and communication systems that's on there.  What's happening?  Where is it in its construction?  In its design?  Especially for the EM-1 crew module and, and everything that's going on there?    Dr. Greg Holt: So we've got really communication and navigation equipment sort of scattered all around the vehicle.    Host: Oh really?  Dr. Greg Holt: So the we have antennas sort of distributed all around.  We have a handful of antennas around the, the capsule.  The cone shape in the front.  And then we have more antennas around the, the service module in the back.  And these are what we call phased array antennas as our primary communication system.  And so they actually have active electronics that will steer and shape that, the beam from the, from the antenna.  So it actually shapes that antenna pattern just the right direction that we want it to maximize that bandwidth.  As we're, as we're flying along and orienting the spacecraft in different directions.  The beam will actually use those electronics to steer the beam over to just the right spot on earth.  And, and really get us those high bandwidths that I was talking about that gives us the cool HD video and all that.  And so those, those antennas are kind of a, the tip of the spear when it comes to the to the communications system.  And then of course that all feeds down into the guts of the communication equipment where we have baseband processors.  And then our S-Band transponders.  That actually do the processing of the signal.  And puts all that data and telemetry on there.  And of course the crew voice and the video.  All the great information that we want to get down.  It has to all get mixed together into that radio signal and sent out those antennas down to the ground.  To be picked up by the Deep Space Network dishes.  And then routed ultimately to Mission Control.  Or to wherever we need to, that information to go.    Host: Wow.  So there, I mean, when it comes to designing and where they're going to be.  Like you said, they're all over.  I know the ESA, European Space Agency is working on the service module.  If I'm, if I'm not mistaken and the crew module's somewhere else.  So they have to talk to each other.  They have to make sure everything works.  I guess we'll start with the mission itself.  In the mission, how long are the crew module and the service module together throughout the whole mission?    Dr. Greg Holt: So they're together for most of the mission in fact.   Host: Really? Okay.  Dr. Greg Holt: So all the way through.  Obviously they're mated together early on in the process.  Before it ever gets attached to the, to the booster and get rolled out to the pad.  For the entire mission all the way to the moon and back, that service module's attached.  Providing power, and consumables to the vehicle.  And it will really only detach the, the crew module from the service module for the last 20 minutes or so of the flight.  So right before we re-enter the atmosphere.  We will detach, and then the crew module itself will reorient.  And that's the only part that comes back and is the recovered part that has the crew inside, of course.  And survives the re-entry and splashes down for recovery.  The service module just burns up in the atmosphere as it comes back.  But for the majority of the mission, we have that service module attached.  And we take advantage of that, of course.  Like I said because we have antennas on there that we can use to talk to the ground.  We have our nice solar rays there that provide us the power.  We have fuel tanks and the like there that provide us fuel.  And of course we have our big orbital maneuvering system engine on the service module as well.  So it's, it really is sort of a workhorse for us while we're up there.  And we only separate from it at the very last minute.    Host: Right.  It's, I mean, all the, seems like a lot of the, a lot of the efforts of the mission itself are, are coming from the service module.  You've got the fuel, the things that's actually orienting you.  Point, pointing you where you want to go.  That's all important stuff.    Dr. Greg Holt: It is.  It is.  But the, the bulk of the avionics.  And like I was saying before, the communication, navigation equipment.  That all has to be there up there in the crew module.  Because we, we still need that after we separate and want to come back.  So our GPS receivers.  Our inertial measurement units.  Which include our accelerometer and gyroscopes.  And you know a lot of the other, like I said, communication, navigation gear.  Are all housed up in that command module, the crew module so that we can hang onto that after we separate.  And use that to help us navigate during the entry phase as well.  We still have to be able to fly the vehicle down and get it now, get it to where we go for splashdown.    Host: Wow.  Seems like the communication and navigation system just in general consists of a lot of components.  You're, you're listing all these different things that have to talk to each other in order to make this thing successful.  How many of them?  It sounds like a lot of them are, are proven.  Used before technologies?  How many of them are, are in this scenario?  And then how many of them are, are more novel, newer technology?    Dr. Greg Holt: It's, a, it's a mix.    Host: Okay.    Dr. Greg Holt: We obviously try to lean on the, the time-tested and proven methods for kind of our primary systems.    Host: Yeah. Of course.    Dr. Greg Holt: And obviously crew safety's a big consideration so we, we want to try to, try to stick with things that we know or at least have high confidence that will work.  So these S-Band radio signals through the Deep Space Network are, are tried and true.  And so we, we use those for the primary communication and navigation.  When we're navigating to, to the moon and back.  Global Positioning System, obviously's been out there for a long time now, since the eighties.  And everybody, like I said, uses it in their car and smartphones.  And does a great job telling us where we are.  So those systems have been around for a while.  And we, and we trust those pretty well.  Some of those, the new, the new back-up systems is where we get into some of the more experimental things.  So the optical navigation system, for example, is, is brand-new.  It's a brand-new technology that we developed just for Orion to have that back-up capability and navigate to the moon and back.  If we happen to lose communication.  So the other new technology that we're working on now is even an optical communication system that uses, uses lasers instead of radio to communicate.  So it's, the example I like to give is like the, the, it's the difference between talking on a, on a normal ethernet line and talking on a fiber line.  You just, the bandwidth just [whoosh] skyrockets.  Once you can get that, get that laser column.  So we do have some experiments there on some of the earlier Orion missions.  With a, with some laser communications.  We call it optical communications.  And it, it, it's trickier and it's more experimental.  But once we get the kinks worked out on that, that'll really increase the bandwidth.  And again, allow us to do even more great video and the ability to interact with a vehicle and get a lot more data down as well.    Host: Yeah, and when you talk about bandwidth, you talk about total information that you can deliver at once, right?  So if you can increase that, that's more information that you can put onto the vehicle.  Of course that means mass.  So you know, there's, there's that consideration too.  But still, I mean my hope as, as the public affairs guy is like you're, you're just beaming four-K images down.  Now that is my dream.  But I don't know.  That would be pretty cool.  So, so when it comes to these experimental things.  And, and even some of the older proven technologies.  What's being done to test it?  To make sure everything's going to work come mission time?    Dr. Greg Holt: So especially with a crew on board, we have to make sure everything is, is really ship shape.  So we, we do test those out pretty, pretty thoroughly.  We have communication tests that we regularly do between the Orion's equipment and the Deep Space Network.  So the folks at JPL actually have a, a little mobile net, network simulator.  They can send around and go test out your equipment.  They, they provide that to all the, the robotic probes that are going out to the solar system.  They will actually put a little mini-Deep Space Network on a truck and send it out to your assembly facility.  And you can plug in and make sure that your equipment works with the Deep Space Network before you ever leave the ground.  So, so we do that same thing on Orion.  It's really got, kind of neat to see them pull, pull up in their, pull up in their truck with the, with the mini DSN.  And-- .    Host: Mini DSN is a pretty cool thing to have inside of a truck.    Dr. Greg Holt: But yeah, it provides an exact replica of the type of signals that you're going to see.  And so you can test out your actual flight hardware right there on the spot.  Make sure that it's going to work.  And so we, we do those tests.  And I, in addition to obviously testing out all of our navigation equipment.  You know, our global positioning system.  We can test that out.  Obviously, just using the live sky signal, coming from the GPS satellite's broadcast here down to the earth.  We can turn that on and make sure that's all working.  And we test that out on all of our other equipment.  Not only on the, on the hardware side, but the software side.  We run that software through, through millions and millions of different simulations with every different kind of perturbation of failure that we can think of to really wring it out.  And make sure that it's responding correctly in all those situations.    Host: Wow.  So, I mean, when we're talking about Orion and the, and the communication and navigation of this deep space vehicle, it is exactly that.  It's a deep space vehicle.  And obviously we have some missions already planned except for it to go around the moon.  But you know once we do that.  You're talking about something that can go out to, to Mars.  And, and, and even further, further than that.  It's, it's a deep space vehicle.  So once we build this technology and we go through some of these first missions.  How much of it is translatable to just deep space travel?  How much can we take with us to future missions?    Dr. Greg Holt: Quite a bit actually.  And so the good news is we're, we're designing this as a deep space vehicle from, from its conception.  So it has all of the systems that you need to, to go out beyond earth orbit.  Just kind of designed in from, from the start.  So we have all of the, the communication equipment.  So that S-Band communications equipment, the, the locations of the antennas.  All of the redundant features that you need to have ultra, ultra-reliable communication.  Not only to the moon, but beyond.  So all of that compatibility is already built in.  So really from a communications standpoint going to Mars just means you just start using a little bit bigger and bigger dishes on the Deep Space Network.  On the ground side.  The further, the farther that you go out.  And your bandwidth, you'll dial back the bandwidth just a little bit to account for the losses that you get as you're going further and further out.  But the, the fundamental equipment is, is all still there.  And you know really the fundamental navigation doesn't change a whole lot, either.   You're still using that encoded radio signal.  And so you know that's really kind of what, what I like to think sets Orion apart.  Is kind of having that built into the vehicle as you know kind of the first, from a first consideration.  Having all of that capability to communicate and navigate all the way out to the very deep, distant objects.  So you know that same communication nav system that we have going to the moon.  Can take us to Mars.  Can take us to any number of deep space destinations that we've got out there.  And you know, it's, it's not quite.  It, it, it's a little bit of overkill.  If they're just going around, just going up to, to low-earth orbit, for example.  You know, all that equipment and all the redundancy that's built in.  But you know, it's really the only thing that can get you out to those deep space destinations.    Host: Yeah, redundancy is, is a key theme here.  But it's, but it's very exciting how translatable a lot of that is.  Maybe you know small tweaks here and there.  And you can keep increasing reliability but, but the systems, the functions, they're, they're all there.  That's very exciting stuff.  So, so we'll kind of end with that.  Just how exciting this time is.  Looking forward to some of these first mission.  What, what do you really looking forward to, EM-1, EM-2?  The first missions of Orion?    Dr. Greg Holt: Boy, I think seeing those first, those first signals there from Mission Control.  Getting those first navigation measurements back.  And seeing that we're on course.  We're, we're, we're, we're really getting the moon the very first time that we, you know, that we take a pass.  And do a measurement predict and show us heading out to the moon.  Instead of just, instead of just going around the earth.  That's going to be pretty exciting.  That hey!  We're, we're on our way, guys.  It's [laughter], it's show time.    Host: Yeah!  That's going to be a good moment!  When you see everything coming back, and you're like wow!  We are on our way.    Dr. Greg Holt: Absolutely!  And then just like everybody else.  You know, the very first time that we get that, get that HD video down from, from the vicinity of the moon.  And get to see those close-ups there.  And some really cool shots of the moon as we're flying by.  You know, that'll be exciting.    Host: I will definitely be looking forward to that as well.  Greg, thank you so much for coming on!  And sharing this insight into communication and navigation of the deep space spacecraft.    [ Music ]    Host:  Hey, thanks for sticking around.  So today we talked with Dr. Greg Holt.  About the navigation and communication of the Orion spacecraft that'll take us out into deep space.  We've talked about communications before.  Again, check out Episode 26: Can You Hear Me Now?  With Bill Foster.  We've also talked about Orion before.  We gave a nice overview of the spacecraft just in general on Episode 17.  And then we talked about how the crew will operate inside for missions that can go up to three weeks on.  We talked about, I think that's Episode 28, yeah.  What was that?  3 Weeks In a Capsule was the name of that.  And we also take, this one's actually a good one.  A Ride Inside The Capsule for Episode 35.  We talked with Jeff Fox for that one.  And actually brought the audio from the first test mission, EFT-1.  And we brought it onto the podcast.  So you can actually just kind of sit back and imagine what it's like to take off and to land and splashdown from, in the Orion spacecraft.  You can go to NASA.gov/orion to learn more.  They have a great article that released recently, Top Five Technologies Needed for a Spacecraft to Survive Deep Space.  Navigation is one of those.  So you go and read a little bit more there.  Otherwise, you can follow us on social media.  We're at the International Space Station, Orion, or the NASA Johnson Space Center accounts on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram.

                        "description": "Gary Jordan (Host): Houston, We Have a Podcast.  Welcome to the official podcast of the NASA Johnson Space Center, Episode 70: Organs on Chips in Space.  I'm Gary Jordan, and I'll be your host today.  On this podcast, we bring in the experts, NASA scientists, engineers, and astronauts all to let you know the coolest information about what's going on in America's space agency.  So, the International Space Station is a lab, a big one in space.  And one of the greatest opportunities presented by this lab is the ability to test things in microgravity.  We have a lot of tests focused at looking at the human body, because a lot happens in this unique environment, muscle deteriorate, bones resemble signs of osteoporosis, and humans seem to age faster.  We figured out ways to counteract these effects, even reverse them, but there's still so much to learn. Because there are so many parts of the human body.  But what if you can isolate organs, cells and tissues and really get a look at what's going on?  Well, there's a way to do that with science and it's weird.  So, today we're talking with Lucie Low.  She's the scientific program manager for the Trans-NIH Tissue Chip for Drug Screening Program for the National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences, NCATS at that National Institute of Health, NIH.  They've partnered with CASIS.  The organization that manages the national lab on the Space Station to send up what are called Tissue Chips, basically devices the size of a thumb drive and they have living human tissues and cells in them.  They're these little clear chips that are designed to be accurate models of the structure and functions of human organs like the lung, the liver, and the heart.  Yeah, I know, straight-up sci-fi but it's real and it's happening aboard the International Space Station.  So with no further delay, let's have Dr. Lucie Low tell us about these little chips and what they're doing in space, and what they aim to discover.  Enjoy.    [ Music ]    Host: Lucie, thank you so much for coming on the podcast today to describe this weird tissue chip thing.  I don't even know where to begin with this stuff.    Dr. Lucie Low: It is straight-up sci-fi.  I mean, straight-up sci-fi.    Host: So, organs, organs on chips.  I don't understand how this—why don't we just kind of start with just, what is it?    Dr. Lucie Low: Okay.    Host: We're talking about tissues chips, let's just start with that.  What is a tissue chip?    Dr. Lucie Low: Okay, so a tissue chip or an organ on a chip, its official fancy name is a Microphysical System or MPS and it is essentially a small bioreactor if you like.  It's a bioengineered micro device that contains human cells, it could be animal cells, but we focus on human cells, in a 3-dimenstional cultural system in some kind of scaffold.  So, it's essentially kind of recreating, recapitulating human tissues in this bioengineered bioreactor.  And so, a tissue chip we say that we have three main properties that actually constitutes a tissue chip.  We say that it has to be 3-dimensional, otherwise it's just a flat layer of cells on a plate and humans are 3-dimensional.  They're not 2-dimensional.  So we need something that's 3-dimensional.  We also want multiple different kinds of cell types.  So, your liver for example is not just made up of hepatocytes or liver cells, it's made up of all kinds of endothelial cells, connective tissues, immune tissues, all that kind of good stuff.  So, we want multiple different kinds of tissue types within our tissue chip and then we also supply fluids to it by microfluidic channels for example, and the idea here is that every single tissue in your body has microvasculature and vasculature associated with it, it has to bring blood, it has to bring fluids, it has to bring nutrients, and it has to take away all the detritus that your cells create, all the rubbish that comes out of your cells has to get flown away.   So, that is how microfluidics comes into it, because you are then not only providing a means of support for the tissues with all of the stuff that you're sending to them, but you're also subjecting them to a lot of the kinds of stretch and shear forces that all of your tissues are subject to in vivo every single day.  So, if you think about your lungs, they don't just sit there.  They stretch, they expand and then they contract.  Every single cell in your lung is there for expanding and contracting every single day, multiple different times.  So, the idea is that tissue chips can model these kinds of stretches, these kinds of shear forces, this kind of pulsatile flow as you get blood pumping through the system, exposure to all these different kinds of cell types, exposure to some kind of immune response and it's all in this tiny little system that could be the size of a USB stick.    Host: Wow.  That's how big they are?  You're jamming this all into something that's the size of a USB stick?    Dr. Lucie Low: So, the small ones can be really small.  They could be the size of the modern futuristic USB sticks.  Some of the other ones might be a bit bigger, especially if you are talking about which we can talk about later, is linked-organ systems.    Host: Yeah.    Dr. Lucie Low: You might get something bigger.  The size of a modern day petri dish.    Host: Okay.  Okay.  So, how do you, is you're talking about all these different complicated systems, Is this, are all of these in one single tissue chip or are they connected and simulating them individually?    Dr. Lucie Low: So, that's a great question.  So, the tissue chip field has really evolved and exploded over the past few years, and as a result of that, there's this massive diversity in the systems that we have.  So, you might have one single chip that's quite straightforward, it's just modeling say one single tissue and there might be other chips that model other single tissues and then there's ways to link those physically through pumps and through microfluidic channels, or you might get systems that on one single plate have multiple different sort of pots for your different kinds of tissues and then you can perfuse those with what's called, we would call a universal medium or a blood memetic.  So, you could get multiple different kinds of tissues within one system, and so there's really a broad range of everything from single tissues to multiple linked tissues.  The linked tissues is harder.  It's much more complicated for a number of reasons, but it definitely starts off with one single tissue and then you can build from that.    Host: Okay.  So, how does, how does it work?  When you say tissue chip what I'm imaging is lie a heart in like something that's a chip, but I don't think that's what it is.    Dr. Lucie Low: So, the \"chips\" word comes from the idea that the original chips were made often with silicon plastics much like computer chips, processor chips.  So, that's where that idea came from and the idea of this micro-embossing and microfluidics and micro technology is where that kind of concept of computer chips to tissue chips came from.  But nowadays, there's such a, like I said, this huge broad diversity in these different kinds of systems that really the key concept of what a tissue chip is, is this space, this pot, this bioreactor where you can chuck in a bunch of different cells from a number of different sources and we can talk a bit more about some of the challenges faced with cell sourcing for example, but essentially you throw all these cells together, you provide them with the nutrients they need, they buzz along and they do their thing and they chitchat to each other, and then what you get is a functional unit of what human tissues are like in vitro is the key thing; it's outside of your body.  So, it's literally like taking a little bit of you and putting it into a pot, letting the cells chat to each other, looking at how they respond to different stresses, different drugs, different genetics, and then seeing what they do in vitro to predict what your body is doing in vivo.    Host: Huh, okay.  So, it's not necessarily a tiny heart in the chip.  It's all the components of the heart working together, getting the nutrients it needs and then you do what to it to say, to understand how it reacts?  Are you putting drugs in there?  Are you, what are you doing to it?    Dr. Lucie Low: Exactly.  So, let's look at the heart as an example.    Host: Yes.    Dr. Lucie Low: So, your heart isn't just one amorphous blob.  It might look like it from the outside, but it's incredibly complicated.    Host: Oh yeah.    Dr. Lucie Low: You have different kinds of cardiomyocytes or heart cells in the atria as you do in the ventricles, and so the cardiomyocytes that makeup that blob of tissue that you're working to make it a tissue chip are going to be slightly different.  So, it might be that some researchers decided to focus on the atrium.  So, they'll look at atrial cardiomyocytes.  They might decide to look at atrial fibrillation, so they might be able to take some kinds of skin cells, for example, fibroblasts from patients with atrial fibrillation.  They can do what's called or use stem cell technology and create induced pluripotent stem cell derived cells from these people's skin cells and create small blobs of atrial tissue that is derived from that person who's got atrial fibrillation.    Host: Okay.    Dr. Lucie Low: In this in vivo—in vitro system.  Then they can start looking at the effects of different drugs.  They can start looking at the effects of different stresses, different carbon dioxide levels All kinds of different things.  They can start if they want to get really fancy, is they can start looking at the effect of gene editing techniques on these tissues to see how they'll then respond in vitro to be able to predict what human responses would be.    Host: Okay.  So, you can even isolate specific functions of the complicated organ and say—    Dr. Lucie Low: Yeah.    Host: I want to know what this does to this specific thing whenever this stimulus, this drug, this whatever is applied?    Dr. Lucie Low: Exactly.  Exactly.    Host: Okay.    Dr. Lucie Low: And so, tissue chips have this really broad range of potential functionalities.  So, they arose because there was a need in the drug development process to have better predicted models of human physiology.  So, right now through the drug development process, there is this huge attrition rate.  The number of drugs that get approved is exponentially tiny compared to the number of molecules that might be potential hits in lead compounds during that development process.  And there's a few reasons for that and a couple of those reasons are firstly that many of the molecules that get put, that come out of drug development processes turn out to be toxic.  They might be toxic to cells on a 2-dimensional level.  They might be toxic in animals, or worse, they might be toxic when you put them into human subjects in early clinical trials.  Now, that's a big no-no and that's what we want to avoid.    Host: Yeah.    Dr. Lucie Low: Another reason that a lot of drugs fail is because they don't actually do what they're supposed to be doing.  This is a concept of efficacy.  So, you can run a bunch of tests in vitro in a 2-dimensional well plate.  You can run a bunch of tests in animals which provide a wonderful analog of a whole organism system, but animals are not humans. Humans are animals, but that's a different discussion.  [laughter]  The idea is that animal and human physiology can be very different.  We have different ways of metabolizing drugs in our liver, all kinds of different enzymes and so there's a real disconnect between all these wonderful drugs that are coming out that are actually going to be useful.  And so, tissue chips actually arose as a way to be able to understand human physiology to be able to gauge toxicity much earlier on in the drug development process.  And then to be able to check that potentially some of the drugs that are coming through that pipeline are actually going to be doing what they're supposed to be doing without some necessary, or necessarily adverse side effects.    Host: Uh-hum.  Without actually giving it to a human.    Dr. Lucie Low: Exactly.    Host: You have all these tests to see how it's going to function and then this gives you another method, another check.    Dr. Lucie Low: Exactly.    Host: To say, yeah, this going to work in humans, but we haven't necessarily poisoned anyone.    Dr. Lucie Low: Exactly.    Host: Yeah.    Dr. Lucie Low: And so, tissue chips are an incredible tool in that process.  They're not the be-all and the end-all.  They're not going to replace animals anytime soon we don't think, but they could be an incredible tool in the drug development process.  Another way that we can see that they could be really incredibly useful is in terms of disease modeling.  So, if you look at the diseases that humans are faced with, cancers, genetic disorders, pathogenic infections, microbial infections, all these terrible kinds of things, every single person reacts differently to these cancers, to these infections, to these environmental exposures and so using tissue chips is a way to really understand in a very easily tightly controllable model system exactly what's happening to your physiology or to your friend's physiology or to your brother's physiology in this in vitro system.  So, it enables us to be able to predict population responses for example to different kinds of infections or if you can look at cancer populations or subpopulations if you have different kinds of genetically caused or genetically risk-driven cancers, then you can start using the tissue chips and modeling these in tissue chips to understand what exactly is it about this particular subpopulation that's making them, that's making their cancers act in a particular way towards a particular drug or what kind of particular drug might be more useful in this population than in this population, or what kind of cancer drug might cure the cancer in this population, but kill everyone in a different population?   So, the ways that you can use these chips to model disease and to understand the pathogenetic causes and all of the associated stuff that goes along with disease mechanisms in a chip, it means you just can't do that in animals.  You just can't do that in 2-dimensional systems and you also can't do it in a human, because there are so many other variables in humans that it's a whole different can of worms to try and understand.    Host: Yeah.  It sounds so, from what you're describing, it sounds like this is very much in place.  This is a product that's being used right now for all of these different tests.  Is that right?    Dr. Lucie Low: So, there's a spectrum of answers to that.    Host: Okay.  Okay.    Dr. Lucie Low: Tissue chips have been around for about a decade or so, but it's only really in the last 5 or 6 years that there's this really broad diversity of chips that have come to be created and developed.    Host: I see.    Dr. Lucie Low: And that's partly due to a lot of NIH funding, so funding from the U.S. Government, funding from other governments around the world.  There are a few commercially available tissue chips that different companies are selling.  They're modeling all kinds of different tissues, but at the moment it's still quite early.  It's still pretty early in the bio, in this biotech stage.  Its' very exciting to see where it's going to go, but there's a lot of challenges that are still faced by the field that everyone as a community is trying to kind of crowdsource and workout some of the answers to.    Host: Yeah.  It sounds like one of the things you were kind of going towards is more personalized medicine, more of that individual aspect of things.  Understanding how these drugs or whatever may effect different populations.    Dr. Lucie Low: Yeah.    Host: Is that something that is being researched or is applied now?    Dr. Lucie Low: Absolutely.  It's one of those huge potential areas we see—   Host: Yeah.    Dr. Lucie Low: Could be, tissue chips could be massively helpful in.  So, like I said, there's lots of space for tissue chips in the toxicology world, all those kind of efficacy type stuff, but if you're talking about precision medicine, that's an early field in itself.  So—    Host: Yeah.    Dr. Lucie Low: The medicine is definitely moving that way.  It's starting to understand that different genetics mean that different people are sensitive to different concentrations and different cocktails, combinations of drugs, but there's that in itself there's still such a huge area of research that, again, what we're saying is that tissue chips could be an incredibly useful tool to model all of these and to pop into the toolbox.    Host: Yeah.    Dr. Lucie Low: To help answer these difficult questions.    Host: That's actually why you're in town today isn't it?  You're talking with colleagues from around NASA or I guess other organizations as well?    Dr. Lucie Low: Yep exactly.  I'm at a workshop today for precision medicine.  I'm going to be talking this afternoon about tissue chips for disease modeling and precision medicine efforts.    Host: There you go.  Well, thank you for stopping by.    Dr. Lucie Low: I'm delighted to be here.    Host: Alright, so we should probably dive into the fact that this is a capability that's being tested right now, still a lot to figure out, but one of the things we're looking at is using these in space, right?  So, why, what do we need to know about how these are used in space?  What is this going to help us understand?    Dr. Lucie Low: So, this is part of a really exciting program that where I work the National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences, is spearheading.  We've partnered with CASIS which is the Center for Advancement of Science in Space and we have got together to send these tissue chips to, as you say, the International Space Station and we could not be more excited for a number of reasons.  Microgravity has an incredibly disruptional effect on the human body in ways that we don't necessarily fully understand and I know that you've had the 5-part series from the human research program talking about the different risks in space.    Host:Yeah.    Dr. Lucie Low: And so, a lot of those risks in space could actually potentially be modeled on tissue chips, so that's the first thing is that these tissue chips could give really important information about disease pathology, understanding of microgravity effects in human tissues in in vitro systems, so that's going to be useful for the space research field.    Host: Yeah.    Dr. Lucie Low: The space biomedical research field.  But also, microgravity seems to cause changes in human physiology that actually directly translate to disease pathology here on earth.  So, some of the fluid shift stuff that occurs up in microgravity is directly correlational to some different kinds of cardiovascular disease.  There's a higher incidence of kidney stones up in microgravity which we don't really understand why.  Kidney stones, big clinical problem.    Host: Yeah.    Dr. Lucie Low: Aging of the immune system or immunosenescence is seen as people get older down here on earth or they get exposed to more kinds of different viruses and colds and bacteria, their immune system responds appropriately or inappropriately and there's been anecdotal evidence and some evidence of how T-cells for example, respond differently to microgravity in space and I think Dr. Brian Crucian was actually talking about that one on one of your previous podcasts.    Host:Yeah.    Dr. Lucie Low: So, there's all these changes that happen up in microgravity that are really interesting and important and potentially very informative for human disease here on earth.  And so, that's what we're using these tissue chips for in space is that we can model things that might take months or years to occur down here on earth if you're looking at sarcopenia which is muscle loss or osteoporosis which is loss of bone density which is a huge issue for astronauts in space.  We can model something that might take 10 or 15 years on earth to become even clinically relevant in a couple of weeks up in microgravity.    Host: Whoa.    Dr. Lucie Low: So, we are able to really try and start understanding disease pathologies and uncovering disease pathologies in a very accelerated way that we couldn't do down here on earth.    Host: How is that?  How is the timeline accelerated with microgravity?    Dr. Lucie Low: Well, that's what we don't understand.    Host: Whoa.    Dr. Lucie Low: So, that's why it's of interest both for us as researchers for human health here on earth, because we want to understand what is that causes osteoporosis?  Is it genetic, is it environmental, what is it?    Host:Yeah.    Dr. Lucie Low: Up in space, there has to be a huge environmental aspect to it.  So, what is the actual biological mechanisms and molecular biology underpinning that loss of bone density up on a station that is so fast?  Could we potentially uncover new molecules that tissues respond to up in space that mean that it gives us potential new therapeutic targets to target osteoporosis here on earth?  Could it give us insight into genetic mechanisms and genetic predispositions?  So, we're really looking to understand new things by being able to utilize the microgravity up on station.    Host: Wow.  And this kind of goes back to your point of how small they are, right?  This is a huge consideration for sending things up to space?    Dr. Lucie Low: Yep.    Host: Is mass is also a consideration when you're sending things in a cargo vehicle.  So, of you can send all of these chips with all of these different organs and functions—  Dr. Lucie Low: Yep.    Host: Altogether. That will give you some time.    Dr. Lucie Low: Yeah.    Host: And some I guess flexibility with what you can accomplish.    Dr. Lucie Low: Yep.  And so, a key point that you just raised there is how the chips are small.    Host: Yeah.    Dr. Lucie Low: And that's absolutely true.  But if you look at the pumps and the computational needs that are needed to supply these chips with their microfluidic channels, with all of their plasma and all of their takeaway, all of their effluent that comes out the chip, then all of a sudden your teeny-tiny chip could need something to support it that's the size of your kitchen refrigerator.  So, one of the key challenges that our investigators have to face and that we're really excited to be partnering with CASIS and with NASA to achieve is forcing our teams to make their teeny-tiny chips with their big refrigerator size support units.  Put all their teeny-tiny chips into something the size of a shoebox.    Host: Whoa.    Dr. Lucie Low: Because that's what's going to fit on a rocket that can then be taken up to station and just be plugged and played literally like a Lego piece, just plug it in and play it.  So, right now, a lot of the chips that are created and designed here on earth are quite bespoke, they're quite artisanal, and so they're developed by each individual lab and each individual researcher, but it's very hard for them to translate that to a broader audience, because the specialty that's needed to create and seed and get these chips functional is very specific and specialized and we've had the term a \"Chip Whisperer\" being thrown around because it can be quite complicated.  You need really transdisciplinary experience and understanding to be able to get some of these chips to function.  So, that's another one of the challenges with the Chips in Space Program, is that our chips have to become what has been described by various NASA astronauts as \"pilot proof.\" [laughter] So, it has to be able for someone as stupid as an astronaut.    Host: Oh, okay.  Dr. Lucie Low: To be able to put— their words not ours, their words. [laughter] But it has to be simple enough and turnkey enough that they can take it out of the capsule that's just arrived.    Host: Yeah.    Dr. Lucie Low: They can plug it into the systems on station, they can turn a valve, they can do this, they can do that, and it doesn't require specialized scientific knowledge to be able to do that.    Host: Yeah.    Dr. Lucie Low: And so the ability to be able to create systems that do that mean that down here on earth we suddenly have this tool that can model of all of this cool biological stuff, all of this cool technical stuff, but it can be sent anywhere on the planet.    Host: Yeah.  Wow.  So, that's funny what you said about the astronauts, I was laughing just because it's mainly because they have so much to do, right?  So, it's like understanding this complex process is going to take more time and energy, the more simple you can make it.    Dr. Lucie Low: Yeah.  Absolutely.  Host: The more easier the execution, the more people that can get their hands on it, but it sounds like that's translatable to even just the process on earth.    Dr. Lucie Low: Exactly.    Host: You get these giant refrigerator size things down to a shoebox, if you get people that can go in and flip a couple of switches, read a manual, and then they're good to go.    Dr. Lucie Low: Exactly.    Host: That makes the whole process a lot faster and easier.    Dr. Lucie Low: Exactly.  And it takes it from a large complicated process that requires a lot of specialist need to something that any lab on the planet could have and any summer high school student could potentially be able to go in and actually run experiments in this way.    Host: So, you were hinting at some of the challenges of manufacturing tissue chips before, so what are those challenges?  It sounds like you were talking about cross-disciplinary understanding of how the whole thing works.  What are some of the hardest parts about creating these things?    Dr. Lucie Low: So, that's a great question and I'll preface this by saying that science is hard.  It's complicated.  It's messy.  Things don't work.  It's just a repeated iteration of failure and trying to get better.  So, one of the key things about understanding tissue chips and their development is just how, like I said, transdisciplinary it is.  You have technical challenges.  You have biological challenges.  If you're talking about technical challenges, and I'll just refer to the design of them here on earth because the space stuff is a whole different ballgame, but if you talk about technical challenges you have to think about what materials is your chip going to be made of?  Is it going to be made of a kind of plastic that absorbs lots of different kinds of drugs or, but that you see through with a microscope, or is going to be made out of something else that is not so optically clear, so you might be able to see that the cells are doing in real-time instead?  So, there are always tradeoffs related to the design of your chip based on what questions you want to ask of it.  You might have to think about how you're going to connect multiple different organ systems.  So, we might not see bubbles as a potentially big problem if you're talking about bubbles in tubes or piping, but if you're talking about microfluidics, bubbles are death.    Host: Oh.  Dr. Lucie Low: Bubbles will kill your system, because they're microfluidics can't pump and your cells will die.  If you're talking about how to link different systems you have to start thinking about how are you going to maintain sterility.  So, your cell culture in each of your systems can be quite different.  So, how are you going to link them to make sure that when you plug that next little pipe in you don't pick-up all the dirt and all the crud that's on the desktop surrounding you that you're plugging it into?  So, there's all these issues of sterility.  If you're talking about populating your chips, some of the biological challenges, cell sourcing is a huge issue in the field right now.  You can buy commercially available cell sources for numbers of, many, many different kinds of cells, but you might get differences in the batches.  You might get differences in the media that you need to get them to grow.  It might take you 9 months to actually be able to get the kinds of mature cells that you need before you can even start using them.  So, you've got issues with that.  If you're looking at, as I referred to earlier, induced pluripotent stem cells or IPS-derived cells, that in itself is a whole massive field of research in biology that's only really been around for less than a decade.   It's a huge exciting, massively, interesting field with so much potential, but it's very early days.  So, right now if depending on the tissue that you're looking at, if you take skin cells or a punch biopsy or any other kinds of cells from a human donor, and you try and make them into a different kind of cell through different kinds of cell differentiation protocols, then there's not necessarily any guarantee that what you're going to get is what you are actually looking for.  So, there's all different kinds of issues with the protocols.  There's different kinds of issues with how mature the cells are.  We talked about cardiomyocytes earlier on, if you take or if you try and derive IPS-derived cardiomyocytes from human donors from skin cells or whatever, you get a very young phenotype and phenotype is the word we use for, basically how it looks.  So, you have you genotype which is what the genes are inside it and the phenotype which is how it comes out at the end.  And so, you can get a very immature phenotype that might be equivalent to almost a fetus or a 2-month-old baby which when you're trying to compare that to how that is relevant to the 50-year-old cardiovascular patient that they came from, then there's clearly a disconnect.    Host: Yes.    Dr. Lucie Low: So, there's a lot of work that's going on in that field to look at cell sourcing.    Host: Yeah.    Dr. Lucie Low: Looking at the immune response; every single part of your body, every single organ in your system has different kinds of cells that would have a different kind of immune response very much within their system and it's based on your experience.  I talked about immunosenescence.  It's based on whether or not you had chickenpox as a child or whether or not you had a measles vaccine, all of this kind of stuff.  Modeling that on a chip in this in vitro system can be incredibly challenging, because we still don't understand in a full human system or animal systems, how all of those integrated organs might work together to give an either innate or adaptive immune response.    Host: Wow.  It goes back to your opening kind of comment that science is hard.    Dr. Lucie Low: It's really hard.    Host: Yeah.  So, it's not this plug-in and run sort of phenomenon that we're requesting and this is going to be the challenging part.    Dr. Lucie Low: It depends on the system.  There are some that are plug and play.  There are some liver systems.  There are kidney systems.  Kidney proximal tubules that are complicated, but are relatively well-validated in a sense that they can be replicated in a number of different laboratories, they can be replicated with relatively standardized cell lines and so then you're starting to get to the stage where you're getting a product that is much more useful for the broader community, but it really depends on the chip, it depends on the system, it depends on the organ.    Host: Yeah.    Dr. Lucie Low: There are so many variables and so it's an incredibly broad spectrum of where we are and where we're going.    Host: Which is why it's not a replace everything else now.  We're just doing tissue chips.  It's just another.    Dr. Lucie Low: Exactly.    Host: Yeah.  Okay.    Dr. Lucie Low: So, certainly within the field we have a lot of controversy and banter and back and forth amongst our investigators and about people who might be end users how useful are these systems going to be?  What kind of questions can we ask?  And those are really great questions that everyone is involved in, because this is the evolution of a whole new biotech.    Host: Yeah.    Dr. Lucie Low: And it's going to have multiple different uses on so many different levels and so everything we do we're asking about why are we doing this?  Why is this important?    Host: Yeah.  Do you have an example that you can recall of something that you were testing with other models and then came to the tissue chips and said, \"Oh, this is kind of surprising\" or something that the tissue chips maybe revealed that wasn't apparent before?    Dr. Lucie Low: And because the liver is the organ that does all of the drug metabolism and then spits it out to all the different organs.    Host: Yeah.    Dr. Lucie Low: A lot of what is incredibly important in drug development is the actual drug metabolism.  And so, this is where what we call PKPD which is pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic modeling and various other kinds of modeling come into play, because if you can link tissue chips together, get integrated organ systems which we talked a little bit about some of the challenges.    Host: Yes.    Dr. Lucie Low: Then you can start understanding how sequential metabolism might happen for example in the liver, in the human.  You can understand how you might take a drug through the mouth, some of your saliva enzymes might change how it's broken down.  You can run it through the gut and then see how the different kinds of gut acids might be effecting the different metabolites, send it to the liver, see what kinds of bioactive metabolites might come out of it, send it to the kidney and see which types of molecules might get stuck in your kidney.  They might be nephrotoxic.    Host: Yeah.    Dr. Lucie Low: Or what kinds of metabolites might pass up and get passed through, for example, your blood brain barrier.  Now, if you suddenly got active metabolites or something passing through your blood brain barrier, then you have a whole different world of hurt, because all of a sudden you're bringing the brain into the equation as well and so you could be disrupting so many different systems within your body without realizing and that's something that animal studies can't necessarily replicate.  Whereas, if you're very targeted in how you link tissue chips and look at what you're the outcomes that you're getting from each chip and what's being sent on and you can be very specific in looking at off-target side effects for example.    Host: Yeah.  This goes back to your kind of statement about how it's kind of progressing and evolving as we go on.    Dr. Lucie Low: Yes, exactly.    Host: And kind of linking all these tissue chips to understand, you know, you're talking about tissues, talking about organs on chips, but how they're connected and resembling the human body.    Dr. Lucie Low: Yes, human on a chip.    Host: And how everything effects everything.    Dr. Lucie Low: Exactly.    Host: Because honestly, you know, you take, you take like a I don't know an antacid whenever your stomach is upset, but how is it affecting other things.    Dr. Lucie Low: Yep.    Host: You know?  Just questions like that that you might not understand.    Dr. Lucie Low: Yeah.    Host: Or like how, how you take like a I don't know antihistamine after you get like a bug bite and.    Dr. Lucie Low: Yeah.    Host: Somehow it disappears.  I don't know.  This is all foreign to me, because I'm not like a doctor.  I'm sure you're like, \"Oh, yeah that's very simple\", but.    Dr. Lucie Low: Absolutely not.  Nothing about this is simple.    Host: Oh, okay.    Dr. Lucie Low: Humans are not simple. [laughter]   Host: That's why we need—    Dr. Lucie Low: We may think they are.    Host: Well, some people I know are simple, but—    Dr. Lucie Low: Their systems are pretty complex, and so we're trying to mimic some of that complexity in these tools.    Host: Okay.  So, why don't we kind of revisit the tissue chips and just kind of go back to sort of the history, the inception.    Dr. Lucie Low: Okay.    Host: Of this.  Do you know where it started?  How it kind of evolved, because the idea of putting something on a chip just seems so like a.    Dr. Lucie Low: Yeah.    Host: A human function on a little device.    Dr. Lucie Low: Yeah.    Host: It just seems so foreign.    Dr. Lucie Low: Yeah.    Host: So, where did this all come about?    Dr. Lucie Low: So, so what is that phrase?  Is it necessity is the driver of innovation or something like that?    Host: It's beautiful enough as it is, yeah.    Dr. Lucie Low: So, so there's been this huge push like I mentioned in drug development.  There's been this big disconnect between humans and animals.  There's been a big disconnect between 2-dimentional cell dishes and more complicated model systems and there's this huge attrition rate in the development of new drugs.  And so, early on about 10-15 years ago, the NIH, National Institute of Health, got together with the FDA, the Food and Drug Administration, and they said \"Hey, we have these problems.  We need new tools.  We need new ways to try and advance regulatory science and that was literally the name of the program was Advancing Regulatory Science.  And so, they had a bunch of different applications that came in and one of the applications that came into that program was what, was for what was called the Development and Design of a Heart-Lung Micromachine, and this was if you like the original lung on a chip.  This was a very elegant and quite simple, but still very effective design where they, the team actually designed the lung alveolus on a chip.   They designed a system where they had lung epithelial cells on one side and other kinds of cells on the other side and then they had a membrane between them which was, which they could if they applied vacuum forces down the side of this chip, they could cause the membrane to stretch and expand and contract, expand and contract.    Host: Just like the lung.    Dr. Lucie Low: Just like your lung, exactly.  So, they were mimicking these biological forces to these cells on both sides of the membrane as would be seen in your lung alveolus, and so they were able to see using these different kinds of cells what effects the different kinds of drugs had on the system.  They could look at bacterial infections and see how bacteria can pass through the system.  They could look at things like nanoparticles, cigarette smoke, all kinds of different things that might affect our lungs and they could look in this little in vitro tool.  And so, since then the premise of that was it was one of those things where if it was a good idea, someone's going to come up with it anyway, but it was definitely there was a lot of interest at the same time and so as a result, NIH then decided to get together with DARPA, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, and they were going to co-fund two different programs which had slightly different, slightly different aims but that would run concurrent with each other to fund the development of these tissue chips.  And so, NIH funded a 5-year program which was for tissue chips for drug screening and DARPA ran a program which was to create a human body on a chip.  So, DARPA wanted 10 different organ systems represented in one machine that you could plug-in and then do all this stuff.  So, NIH and DARPA they had their same aim, slightly different goals.    Host: Yeah.    Dr. Lucie Low: And, but faced a lot of challenges, similar challenges along the way.  So, those 5-year programs ran and they ended in 2017, and DARPA said hey this was awesome.  You know, take it and go, like you guys did an awesome job, like we want to see what you guys come up with now.  So, NIH is continuing to fund that and we're now running a program called Tissue Chips for Disease Modeling and Efficacy Testing.  We have the Tissue Chips in Space Program.    Host: Right.    Dr. Lucie Low: We have a Tissue Chip Testing Centers Program.  So, we have a number of different programs that are not coming through to support the development of these chips in different ways and see where we can go and what we can do with this technology.    Host: Okay.  So, let's focus on the Tissue Chips in Space part.  So, what's the plan there?  When are going to start ramping up and sending these?    Dr. Lucie Low: Well, so the first nail-biting launches begin in November.    Host: Okay.    Dr. Lucie Low: This year.    Host: Oh, wow.    Dr. Lucie Low: So, November 2018.  So, we have our first teams getting ready to the decamp down to Kennedy Space Center.    Host: Okay.    Dr. Lucie Low: And they're going to be setting their labs up there and getting their chips ready to launch.  So, this was a 4-year program that began last year and now we have our teams getting ready to launch.  They're going to send two missions, two flights and the second flight is going to be building on what they learned from the first flight, both technical and biological.    Host: Okay.    Dr. Lucie Low: So, we have 5 teams funded through that and all of the information is on the NCATS website, but we also then partnered with NIBIB which is another institute for biomedical imaging and bioengineering at NIH.  So, we partnered with them and we've, we reissued this program.  We said, \"Hey guys this is so great.  We want to, you know, want to give you some more money.  What else you got?\"  So, we've got another few projects that have just been funded through that and that's going to be being announced very shortly.  And so, those guys will be flying two years from now and then another two years from then.    Host: Wow.  Okay, so I like that idea of building.  So, you're just the idea is find out what's going to happen to these things in space, right?  You guys will either they're being sent and designed and tested, but then after you learn, to send more stuff up.    Dr. Lucie Low: Yes.    Host: So, is a lot of it the biological science or is some of it the systems themselves in making sure that shoebox thing is going to work. Maybe a little bit of both?    Dr. Lucie Low: It's absolutely it's both.  So, say you're looking at a system that is modeling the blood brain barrier, and you've gone from having one chip with a refrigerator size support mechanism to 12 chips in something the size of a shoebox and we do have a team that's been doing that, then all of a sudden they have 12 times the number of things that could potentially go wrong with their pumping mechanisms.  On, in a shoebox that's going to be packed into a launch vehicle, sit on a launch pad for a while, and then rumbled around and then gets shot up into space at a high speed.    Host: Yeah.    Dr. Lucie Low: So, we don't know what's going to happen in that circumstance.  We can plan and mitigate for as much as possible, as NASA does with everything they do that they're sending to space, and we can get out guys to drop their chips from the tops of their buildings and see how they shatter or see if their cells detach from the walls of the chip inside the chip when they do that.  So, we can make them run controls on hyper-gravity.  We can make them run controls on microgravity.  We can make them get there great-aunt Nellie who has never touched a petri dish or a pippete in her life to try and use the system and see just how pilot proof this system might be.    Host: Yeah.    Dr. Lucie Low: So, we can get our guys to do as many experiments on earth as they can to try to work out what could go wrong.    Host: Yeah.    Dr. Lucie Low: But until they do it, we don't know.    Host: Okay.    Dr. Lucie Low: And then the key idea is that from the first flight that they do, the science that they're going to be looking at is going to say oh, hey here's something here that we haven't seen before that we think is a result of microgravity and we're going to have to do a bunch of different controls to make sure that it's microgravity that's actually causing that change, say and how leaky the blood brain barrier might be, but then we can take that result from the first flight and we can say well if we see that there's this change in the blood brain barrier, we're pretty sure it's due to microgravity and we've got one more flight.  Do we have any potential drugs for this kind of thing?  Or is there a potential intervention?  Or is there a potential disease that this might be modeling?  Then you can investigate that with the second flight in an applied manner.  So, that's why we have these two flights.  So, you could almost say the first flight as a practice.    Host: Yeah.    Dr. Lucie Low: It's absolutely not.  It's incredibly scientifically rigorous, but it's going to tell us what is actually going on so that we can then apply the results from that to maybe get new therapeutics, new disease mechanisms, new understanding of what's going on in your body by shooting you up to space.    Host: Huh.  Could you use the tissue chips as, I'm trying to think of how this works; can you use them in space kind of understand, you know, just kind of run it, understand what's going on and then bring it down to earth, plug it again and run some, I don't know, new drugs and see if it has some sort of effect?  Is that something that something that is possible?    Dr. Lucie Low: So, yeah.  Now you're thinking like our teams have been thinking which is great.    Host: Alright.    Dr. Lucie Low: So, there's so many different things you can do.    Host: Okay.    Dr. Lucie Low: So, some of our teams are sending the tissues up and they're freezing them straight after they get to microgravity because they want to see what the effects of hyper-gravity were at launch.    Host: Okay.  Oh.    Dr. Lucie Low: The stresses associated with a launch.  Then they'll have out of that cohort they'll have some chips that they don't freeze and they'll sit in microgravity and bubble around for a while and do their thing and then they'll freeze them.    Host: Okay.    Dr. Lucie Low: And then we have other teams that are sending their chips up to space and we have one team which is doing some really cool work looking at terminal differentiation of T-cells, so looking at the immune response and how microgravity effects it and so what's very exciting with this project is that they're going to be taking the chips up to space, they're going to be able to see what effect launch has, what effect microgravity has, but then they're also going to be bringing their chips back down to earth with the cells still buzzing and doing their thing.  So, then they're going to be able to see what effect the return to standard gravity has on their systems and whether it reverses the changes that they've seen through microgravity.  So, that is going to tell you exactly what space flight associated changes there are when this particular immune response, for example, and how it can revert back to normal back here on earth, because that's also something that a lot of the astronauts say, is that they come back down and those changes reverse after a few weeks or months.    Host: Right.  That is fascinating.  That whole process can be done with the tissue chips.  That's insane.    Dr. Lucie Low: Yeah.  So, maybe one day we'll be able to put astronauts on a chip and send them up either alongside the other astronauts or before they go after they've been and do personalized types stuff with astronaut data, with astronaut tissues.    Host: Wow.  So, that's the future then?  There you're talking about more personalized chips maybe even more functions on a single chip?  Is that some of the future stuff you're looking at?    Dr. Lucie Low: Yeah, yeah potentially.    Host: Wow.    Dr. Lucie Low: Yeah.  So, some of the things that we can look at on the chips.    Host:Yeah.    Dr. Lucie Low: There can be a really broad range of outcomes you're talking about that different kinds of things you want to look at.    Host: Sure.    Dr. Lucie Low: You can, some of the chips are see-through.  So, you can put them under a microscope and see what's going on in real-time.    Host: Yeah.    Dr. Lucie Low: Some of the chips have different kinds of electrodes embedded into them.  So, if you're looking at cardiac tissue or neural tissue, you can see how active the tissues actually are, if they're buzzing, if they're talking to each other with cardiac tissues you can see if their twitching.  So, there's already been some cardiomyocyte work that's been done up on station where you can see that the actual cells where starting to twitch and contract like heart tissue would.  If you're looking at neural tissues, you can start looking at whether the synapses are doing their thing whether the nerve cells are talking to each other and so there's lots of different kinds of analogs and outcomes that you can looking at that tell you what is going on in that tissue, sometimes in real-time in this system.    Host: Let's talk about you Lucie, because this is super complicated and I keep thinking about that phrase where you said it's multidisciplinary to really understand how these things work.  What is your background and then who are you working with to all make this come together?    Dr. Lucie Low: So, I'm actually a neuroscientist by training.    Host: Really?    Dr. Lucie Low: So, I would like to say it's the toughest of tough challenges in human research, but I'm sure that I'll get shot down for saying that.  So, I'm a neuroscientist by training, but I study the neuroscience of pain which is intensely personal but also intensely transdisciplinary.  You have to be able to understand molecular biology.  You have to be able to understand psychology and everything in between.  So, I spent a number of years training as a neuroscientist, a pain neuroscientist and then I decided I wanted to step into the bioengineering biotech field and I was lucky enough to land this job.    Host: Yeah.    Dr. Lucie Low: Which is incredible and super exciting. And so now I work with bioengineers.  I work with biologists from all different areas, because every single organ system that you have will have different specialists.    Host: Yeah.    Dr. Lucie Low: I work with materials engineers.  I work with physicists.  I work with electrical engineers and it's, that's why it's so broad, you know.    Host: Yeah.    Dr. Lucie Low: Mathematicians, epidemiologists, computational theorists, all this kind of crazy stuff.    Host: Whoa.  Okay, yeah.  That's much more broad than I was thinking.  I was thinking more like, I don't know, human sciences.    Dr. Lucie Low: No, it's human sciences, it's material sciences.    Host: Yeah.    Dr. Lucie Low: It's physical sciences.    Host: Wow.  Okay, yeah well that makes sense, right, because.    Dr. Lucie Low: Chemical sciences, must not forget them.    Host: Yeah, to understand how microgravity is, there's a little bit of biology, but there's a little bit of physics too.    Dr. Lucie Low: Yeah.    Host: There's a little bit of math.    Dr. Lucie Low: Absolutely.    Host: Wow.    Dr. Lucie Low: Loads of math.    Host: This is very exciting.  I keep thinking about the future and how this can be, how this can be kind of rolled out.  You said it's been evolving over time.  There's things we want to understand about how it's going to work in space and what it can reveal about what's happening to the human body.  You know, you were talking about osteoporosis.  You were talking about aging.  There's all these the immune system, all these effects that can happen from microgravity.  Going forward, how do you imagine the future for tissue chips.  You know, you were talking about astronauts on chips, you were, like for more functionality, more personalization.  What's the future for this?    Dr. Lucie Low: So, the short answer is all of those.    Host: Oh, wow.    Dr. Lucie Low: So, we like we said, we want to see these tools developed.  We want to see them that they're utility can be demonstrated and then we want to demonstrate to everyone that actually these tools are really helpful and you guys should try using them too.  So, there's avenues everywhere for that.    Host: Yeah.    Dr. Lucie Low: So, some of the areas of research and the stuff that we're going to be focusing on in the future from NIH's end, is moving towards precision medicine, personalized medicine type things.  Looking at different kinds of subpopulations of patients, different demographics, sociodemographics, age demographics, gender, race, ethnicity, all of that good stuff and then also precision medicine.  So, looking at for example rare disease populations.  So, if you can take rare disease populations that might only have 5 or 10 people on the planet who are afflicted with a rare disease.    Host: Yeah.    Dr. Lucie Low: But we can get hold of some of their cells obviously with full informed consent and with them as, you know, involved in the process the whole way through.    Host: Sure.    Dr. Lucie Low: Then they can be involved in clinical trials on a chip.  That means that they can have drugs tested in their systems on chip in vitro that doesn't actually involve the risk that's associated with rare disease patients for actually going through a clinical trial in person.    Host: That's right.    Dr. Lucie Low: So, there's loads of different kinds of applications we see there.    Host: Wow.  And it sounds like more real-time, you know.  There's this the more chips you have, more manufacturing, more personalization.    Dr. Lucie Low: Yep.    Host: More efficiency, it just sounds like just an ever evolving sort of feel.    Dr. Lucie Low: Exactly.  So, in all of the challenges that everyone faces, we're all working together to try and overcome those and move forward as a field because there are key challenges for everyone, but the potential for these tools is really exciting.    Host: Yeah.  That's so wonderful.  I kind of want to end with this is kind of backtracking a little bit thinking about the future, but just the process of working with the tissue chips in space and the relationships between NIH, between CASIS, between NASA, how does that all work to actually make this happen?    Dr. Lucie Low: So, a lot of it involves networking at conferences.    Host: There you go.    Dr. Lucie Low: Hanging out at the Tiki bars afterwards and talking freely.  So.    Host: Yeah.    Dr. Lucie Low: Science is so collaborative especially with these transdisciplinary subjects.  We really want to get people together.  We want to be able to breakdown some of the barriers so that people feel comfortable talking to each other and if that involves sharing a pint after work, then I'm totally okay with that personally.  I'm obviously not paid for with any kind of government funds.  But yeah, our key point is that we, we're all working for the same, towards the same goals.    Host: Right.    Dr. Lucie Low: From NASA's perspective it might be to mitigate and understand the risks associated with long-term space flight.    Host: Right.    Dr. Lucie Low: For NIH's end it's understanding human health and biology and disease here on earth and how to make that better.  But the point is that we both have things that we're working on that overlap.  There's a lot of synergy there between what our end goals are and so we like to work with as many people as we can.  My institute and NCATS in particular, everything we do is collaborative.  Everything we do is designed to bring people in and say, \"Hey you guys have got a great idea.  What can we do with that?  We've got this brilliant idea.  We've have this expertise, let's talk about this.  Let's see who we can try and work this out and crowdsource and move forward.\"    Host: Yeah.  And realizing that the execution of this experiment in space benefits all these different.    Dr. Lucie Low: Everyone.    Host: There you go.    Dr. Lucie Low: Yeah.    Host: Lucie, thank you so much for coming on and explaining this crazy straight-up sci-fi phenomenon of tissues on chips.  I really appreciate you coming on today.    Dr. Lucie Low: It's been wonderful.  Thanks so much Gary.    [ Music ]    Host: Hey thanks for sticking around.  So, today we talked with Dr. Lucie Low about these tissue chips and why we're going to sending them up to space.  So, they're going to be launching on a cargo vehicle coming up here soon, so go to nasa.gov/ntv to find the latest launch schedule so you can watch them go to space live.  We have exciting launches coming here over the next few months, so make sure to see what's coming up here soon.

                        "description": "Gary Jordan (Host): Houston, we have a podcast.  Welcome to the official podcast of the NASA Johnson Space Center.  Episode 71: Apollo and the Moon.  I'm Gary Jordan and I'll be your host today.  So if you're familiar with us, this is where we bring in scientists, engineers, astronauts, all the coolest people to tell you all the cool stuff about NASA.  We explore a lot about human space flight and dive deep into so many topics.  So we're celebrating 50 years since the era of the Apollo missions to the moon.  And there was a lot of political drive behind this initiative.  But there was also some fascinating science.  And it may not look like much, but the moon is full of stories.  Stories about how the earth formed.  Stories of fire and energy.  And there's a very interesting perspective on exploring the moon.  We haven't been since 1972, but there's still so much that we're learning about this celestial body.  And there's plenty of reason to go back.  To give different perspectives on the moon, we have Jennifer Ross-Nazzal and John Gruener.  Jennifer is the resident historian here are the Johnson Space Center.  And can explain in-depth the history of the Apollo program and the first journey to the moon.  Much of it of how and why.   John Gruener is a planetary scientist.  Has been on the podcast before to talk about [inaudible] resource utilization or living off the land.  Basically using the environment to create things you need like fuel, water, or building materials.  So today we're going to go back in time and explore the Apollo program and what it took for humans to land on the moon.  And then we'll discover what we learned about our planet—about our nearest celestial body to our planet from John Gruener.  History can be a great way to learn how to do things better in the future.  So we'll use some of this knowledge to explore the missions ahead.  So with no further delay, let's jump right ahead to our talk with Dr. Jennifer Ross-Nazzal and Mr. John Gruener.  Enjoy.    [ Music ]    Host: Jennifer and John, thank you so much for coming on the podcast today.    John Gruener: Sure, my pleasure.    Host: This is an interesting topic because I usually we stick with one, and John, you're familiar because you came on the podcast before.  You, when you came on here, we talked about living off the land, [inaudible] resource utilization.  Using what you got on the land to create stuff that you need.  But this one is a little bit of a mix because with all the Apollo anniversaries coming up.  I kind of wanted to explore not only the history and really get into that.  And Jennifer, I'm so excited to have you here.  Because the JSC historian?  Oh my gosh!  I have so many questions.  But also the science.  You know?  Not only did we go there, but there's so much that we learned and we're still learning with the moon rocks.  Even with our conversation with Ryan Ziegler not too far, not too long ago.  I forget which podcast episode that was.  But yeah, we, there's still so much to learn.  So this is going to be interesting.  I wanted to start with the history first.  So Jennifer, if you want to kind of, kind of launch it off.  We're going to the moon, right?  And this is, there's a lot of reasons why we're going to the moon.  Back in the Apollo era in the '60s, we have, you know, John F Kennedy.  After 15 minutes of spaceflight experience on the Mercury program.  John F Kennedy stands up there and says, \"Cool!  We're going to the moon now.\"  And it's this kind of political drive.  Was that the main reason why we decided, you know, the moon.  Was, was it mainly the politics?    Dr. Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: Well I think when you're talking about Apollo, you really need to think about like you've said, the circumstances of the time period.  And it was more than just politics.  Really, you need to think at the broader picture.  The Cold War that was happening at that time.  The Soviet Union was well ahead of the United States in terms of space at that point.  Yes, we had just sent Alan Shepherd to space.  We had 15 minutes of space, like you said.  But the Soviets had launched several successful satellites well before we did.  We had a lot of very public problematic launches.  And a lot of people questioned whether or not we were capable of doing what we said we were going to do.  The Soviets, of course every launch was very secret.  We were a very public agency.  So people got to see all of our failures on the public stage.  And so you know Kennedy is trying to think of how we might best the Soviet Union.  You know, what's the best way?  How can we catch up?  We're, we're always seemingly behind.   And so this is the best way.  By coming up with a new plan.  You know, NASA had been studying how we might get to the moon.  But this is an accelerated plan.  He wants to get there by the end of the decade.  And Bob Gilruth who ends up becoming Center Director here at the Manned Spacecraft Center.  Remembers listening to the president.  He was actually flying to Tulsa for a meeting.  And he remembers hearing the President.  And saying he was aghast at these ides-- this idea that we were actually going to go to the moon by the end of the decade.  Because he was going to be responsible for achieving that goal.  And so far, all we had was 15 minutes in space.    Host: Right.  I'm sure he had a sort of a course in mind, based on the progress that it would take.  To I don't know, continue to evolve human space flight.  But this definitely accelerated the plans.    Dr. Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: Absolutely.  Yeah, there was a, there was a lot that had to be achieved by the end of the decade.  You know, they, they had been studying how to get to the moon.  They weren't really sure how to do it.  We've, we've done a lot of interviews with engineers who were working on that.  And, and they, they asked Bob Gilruth, \"Well, how are we going to do that?\"  “I don't know, but that's your job.  Go out and figure out how we're going to get to the moon.”  And now suddenly here we are.  We've got, we've got a deadline.    Host: Yeah.  So before, so before we start looping in the science.  Let's continue with some of the history.  So now we have this proclamation.  We're going to the moon.  What are the next steps?  How did it accelerate to, to, to make sure we were going to make that, that deadline?    Dr. Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: Yeah, well, you know, there were a lot of things that we had to figure out.  We had to determine, what was the mode that we were going to take to the moon?  We weren't really sure how we were going to get there.  The original idea was something that was called direct ascent.  And that was taking this huge rocket known as Nova.  And just flying directly to the moon, and then flying back to earth.  And you know people thought that was a great idea.  But the problem was it was too heavy.  It was going to be way too expensive.  And it was going to take way too long.  But that idea was being discussed for, for you know, many months.  And then there were also two other ideas that were bounced around.  One was Earth Orbit Rendezvous which was taking up two vehicles.  They were going to launch separately.  And they were going to rendezvous and dock in space.  And then they were going to go to the moon.  A lot of people at Marshall really liked that idea.  And then there was another idea that was put forth by people at Langley.  And that's the mode that we ended up using which was Lunar Orbit Rendezvous.   And that actually, that idea was not very popular at first.  The advocates of that actually tried to appeal to headquarters.  Quite often people at the Manned Spacecraft Center initially were not big fans of it.  Eventually they did end up adopting that idea.  Because it was much easier.  It didn't require as much technological work.  It only required one launch.  It enabled the agency to come up with spacecraft specific for earth orbit.  Lunar orbit, and then we had a lunar lander that we could build specifically just for landing on the moon.  And we also didn't need to bring it back.  So it wasn't as much weight as the Direct Ascent rocket that we would have sent.  So we had to come up with that.  That was one of the things that we had to come up with.    Host: Wow.    Dr. Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: You know, we had to train astronauts.  We had to hire more astronauts.  There were a lot of things that had to be done.  Human spaceflight.  Also when NASA was formed, a lot of people thought it was a fad.  Someone, Hugh Dryden, for instance likened it to shooting a lady out of a cannon.  A lot of people who worked for the space task group were very young.  We've interviewed a lot of people who talked about how they were discouraged by their mentors at Langley from taking positions with the space task group because they said.  When human spaceflight is done, you're not going to have a job back here.  So they really tried to discourage them from taking those jobs.    Host: Oh, wow.    Dr. Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: But they were of course very excited about this new opportunity.  This new field.  And so of course we need a new center.  As soon as Kennedy announced that we were going to the moon.  We need a human spaceflight center.  Where we're going to train these astronauts.  Where we're going to house the operations.  So we start looking for a new facility in which we can do all of these things.  Which eventually becomes the Manned Spacecraft Center here in Houston.  What's known as the Johnson Space Center today.    Host: Yeah, and it's because Lyndon B Johnson had a great deal to do with getting it here, right?    Dr. Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: Well, you know, interestingly enough.  A lot of people like to say that.  And it's great because we're here in the Johnson Room here in Houston.    Host: Yeah, I thought it was appropriate.    Dr. Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: Yeah, it's totally appropriate.  But there's, there's a name that most people don't often associate with human spaceflight.  And that's Albert Thomas.  You may recognize the name from the post office on El Camino here in Houston?    Host: Okay.    Dr. Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: And at the time he was head of the House Appropriations Committee.  And he had been for years actually trying to get the Atomic Energy Commission to build a center on this site.  And they were interested.  So when NASA was established.  He started appealing to the first administrator.  And there weren't any plans to build a center here in Houston.  They were building one out in D.C. in Greenbelt.  And he actually threatened the administrator.  He said he wasn't going to give him any money to build that center unless he moved it to Houston.  And eventually, there's a lot of politicking going on.  Once they make the decision that they're going to build a center somewhere in the United States dedicated to human spaceflight.  There's a lot of politicking going on between Albert Thomas because he holds the purse strings for NASA.  We have a lot of Houston boosters like George R Brown.  You recognize his name.  He's got a company, he's a big supporter of Lyndon B Johnson.  Lyndon Johnson, as you pointed out, is the Vice President at the time.  And there's a lot of other people, folks at Rice in particular who were very interested in having a NASA center come to Houston.   So there's a lot of behind the scenes politicking going on.  Trying to bring a center here.  And they actually do visit about 23 sites all over the United States.  Places like Boston and Tampa.  Tampa is actually the number-one choice of NASA.  At MacDill Air Force Base.    Host: Really?    Dr. Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: Yeah, originally it was the number-one choice.  Houston was number two.  So we end up coming here primarily I think because of Albert Thomas.  Not necessarily Johnson.  Johnson, I think, played a role.  But not as big of a roll are Thomas because he had those purse strings.    Host: Interesting.  Where's the Thomas Room?    John Gruener: Congressman from Houston, Texas.  And Sam Rayburn also from Texas was Speaker of the House.  So there was a strong Texas connection to why this place wound up where it is.    Dr. Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: Absolutely.  And Olin Teague. I mean there's, there's.  We, we tend not to have a very strong Texas delegation these days.  But in the '60s, Texas had a lot of sway in Congress.  And if you have a lot of power in Congress, you can bring home the bacon to your constituents.  And so you know it was a really exciting time for the folks here in Houston.  You know, they got that space fever bug.  But you know we, we had to build new facilities and you know.  A lot, a lot of things were going on.    Host: Because the Clear Lake area wasn't really built up yet, right?  And so they kind of picked this plot of land.  And then all of a sudden create jobs.  Things start growing, right?    Dr. Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: Absolutely, yeah.  It met all the requirements that NASA was looking for.  They needed at 1000 acres of land.  And if you look at photos from that time period.  There really wasn't anything on it.  A lot of people joked that they were told well you know, there are alligators on the property.  And when they came out-- because they, they actually invited people from Langley to come out and take what they call look-and-see trips.  They actually flew them out here to decide whether or not they were going to move here.  Because a lot of people were like Houston?  They didn't want to move to Houston.    Host: It’s hot.  Dr. Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: They thought Houston was a bad place to live.  A hurricane had just hit.    Host: Oh yeah. That won’t sell it.  Dr. Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: No.  Absolutely not.  So they weren't really thrilled about it.  But you know people came out and took trips.  And in no way was Clear Lake developed at that time.  It was really a rural area.  Webster had like a one-light stoplight.  And you know a general store, and that was kind of it.  There was a lot of fishing going on, a lot of shrimping, and not much else.  So you know Houston was about 20 miles up.  And even when people did move here, they had to go into Houston to go shopping.  To go out to eat.  There just wasn't a lot of development going on.  But once NASA says we're going to build here.  The company actually that, that donated the land which was donated to Rice.  It's sort of this big Texas deal.  You see the areas start to develop.  You see Clear Lake City develop.  You see Nassau Bay across the street start to develop.  So there's a lot of changes that happened as a result of NASA coming down here.    Host: Lot of growth.  And the reason that they wanted this center was primarily astronaut training.  Was it, was it Mission Control?  What were the primary reasons?  Primary, I guess, functions.    Dr. Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: The space task group was attached to the Langley Research Center.  And they wanted a separate center for human spaceflight.  It just really wasn't—    Host: Human spaceflight?    Dr. Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: Human spaceflight, absolutely.  And so they needed a new center.  There were discussion about where to put Mission Control.  They weren't sure Mission Control was actually going to come here to JSC initially.  But they convinced the administrator to bring it here.  But yes, they needed a place to train astronauts.  They needed a place to put our engineers.  And they wanted the astronauts and engineers to work closely together on things like interfaces.  We also needed things like you realize we're close to the water.  So they wanted to bring in spacecraft by barge.  Houston was a great place to do that.  They also needed a convenient airport.  We have an airport just up the road.  They also wanted universities.  They wanted to live in a, in a place that was full of a, a vibrant cultural community.  Houston definitely was.  So you know Houston had a lot of perks.    Host: Alright.  At what point did, in the program, maybe it was when we decided we were going to the moon.  That the Lunar Curations facility started coming into play.  That this was going to be the place where moon rocks would be.    John Gruener: Right, because it was all focused on the humans, right?    Host: Yeah.    John Gruener: Kennedy said we're going to send man to the moon and return him safely before the decade out.  And there was nothing in there about and while he's there, he's going to pick up rocks and bring them back to, you know.  It was all about the humans and getting them back safely.  But you know as, as the training progressed and as, as we went through Mercury and Gemini, we get into Apollo and then people start planning for an actual surface excursion, you know?  It's, it's when I, my first degree was in aerospace engineering.  Because I thought it was all about that cool flight back and forth, you know, to the moon.  And the spacecraft and the rockets.  But really, you have to ask yourself well, why are you even going to the moon, right?  This was obviously very political, geopolitical driven thing.  But, but nowadays, we ask ourselves why are we going back to the moon?  Or why are we going to Mars?  And it's all about what you're going to do on the surface, right?  And if you don't really have any plans to do something on the surface, well then why go in the first place?  But it was reversed during the Apollo.  So we, we were going to the moon.  So since we are going to the moon, what are we going to do when we get there?    Host: Yeah.    John Gruener: And the obvious thing was geologic field work.  So NASA brought in a geoscientist also worked with the United States Geological Survey, USGS.  To train the astronauts in geologic field work.  What to look for.  How to employ long-lived scientific instruments.  And then they decided okay, well, we're bringing these rocks back and they're on this moon with no atmosphere, right?  No oxygen to interact with the rocks.  So and you're bringing it to Houston with a very humid atmosphere.  Host: Oh yeah.  John Gruener: Right?  Lots of water in our atmosphere here.  So what are the specifications?  What do we need to do to protect these rocks?  And so lot of work went into what we now have as the Apollo Sample Curation Facility.  You mentioned you talked to Ryan Ziegler.  He's running that now.    Host: Yeah.    John Gruener: So yeah, science was very much, I won't say it's an afterthought.  But it came later in the, the process of, of getting to the moon.  And we're going to bring these rocks back, so we need to protect them.  We need the science labs to understand the rocks.  We did have Rice University, University of Houston just right up the road.  You know?  And a lot of the early scientists came from those institutions.  I don't know if you've ever talked to Dr. Wendell Mindell but he was here during Apollo.  He grew up a Houston boy.  Went to Rice, then went out to Caltech.  Well, went to Caltech first, then he went to Rice.  But so you know we, we drew.  You talked about one of the draws for why would the manned space center be here?  Well, we had these two university systems.  That we could pull from.  So you know the, the Lunar Sample Curation Facility started being designed.  But, but even before that from the science prospective it was like, and the safety prospective.  So we're going to land on this moon.  Is it just a dusty surface?  And we're going to sink into this bowl of dust?  And our astronauts aren't going to be able to get off, right?  So we had to send robotic missions to the moon to answer these, not only the lunar environment questions.  But lunar science questions.  You know, very simple thing.  Is the moon an intact surface that you can actually land on?  And walk on?  And work on?  And what a lot of people don't realize is we successfully sent 13 robots to the moon before Neil Armstrong ever set foot there, right?  So the Ranger program was basically a, a big camera.  Almost like a, you know, telescope.  And it just came closer and closer to the moon.  And it kept sending back pictures until it crashed into the moon, right?  A lot of those early Ranger missions didn't work, right.  We, we talked about our failures were right there in, in the public's view, right?  So in all we tried to send about 20 missions to the moon.  But only 13 of them succeeded.  Right?  And that was okay for robotic missions.  But that kind of success rate wouldn't work for humans, right?  13 out of 20.  But after the Rangers slammed into the moon, gave us our first up-close views.  Then we had some lunar orbiters that went into orbit around the moon.  They started taking high-resolution images to pick landing sites.  And then the surveyor landers actually went down and actually touched, landed on the surface of the moon.  Showed that it was competent.  You could walk and work there.  Even had a alpha particle X-ray spectrometer which measure the chemistry of the, on, on the surface of the moon.  Those up-front, those cameras right there in front of the field of surveyor gave us an idea of what the surface was like.  It kind of looked like you know a beach.  Sandy, gravel-y stuff.  So there was a lot of science going on behind the scenes while the humans were in the spotlight.    Host: Right.  So I mean just to, to understand the moon.  Does that, that takes a lot of energy to, to get up there.  Even those robotic missions, maybe smaller rockets, but now you want to send humans.  And like you said with this lunar rendezvous profile, Jennifer.  That's, you're talking about large spacecraft, multiple space, spacecraft.  You need a giant rocket.  So that's when the Saturn V starts coming in, right?  So what was the story there?  To actually make this lunar, this human lunar mission possible?    Dr. Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: Well, yeah.  I mean, we needed, we needed a large rocket.  And Marshall Space Flight Center was heavily involved in developing that Saturn rocket.  And you know what, it didn't need to be as large as that Nova rocket that we talked about for Direct Ascent.  But that was, that was something that they, they worked on.  The German engineers out there at Marshall Space Flight Center.  Here at, at JSC, we were more focused on things like building the spacecraft itself.  So the command module that you see the astronauts working and living in.  As they go to the moon and return back home.  That's really the only thing that gets to come back also from the moon.  And also working on that lunar lander, the lunar module that ends up traveling down to the moon's surface.  And the astronauts live in while they're on the lunar surface.  So you know there's a lot of work that needs to be done.  And there's a lot of contractor all across the United States that were working on this program.  And also universities.  People like at MIT who were working on different projects.   So there, there were thousands of people who worked on the Apollo program.  You know, just people that, that you might not associate with the Apollo program.  People—seamstresses who were sewing space suits for instances, and gloves that the astronauts wore on the moon.    Host: Oh yeah.  Dr. Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: So you know, there are, there are a lot of people involved in this program.  I think a lot of the, the people that we often think of and associate with Apollo are the people that get the most attention.  Who appear on these magazine covers like the astronauts, of course, on life magazine.  Or you might see Chris Kraft who was on the cover of Time Magazine.  All the Mission Control folks before we had TV.  And on the spacecraft we would see what was happening in Mission Control.  That's where all the action was.  But you know we don't often think about all the engineers and the scientists and all the other people who made this program successful.    Host: Right.  And there was with so many people involved.  You said there was a lot of designing, design work going on here, right?  For the command module.  Was the lunar module here too?    Dr. Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: Yes.    Host: Okay, do you know if the picking up moon rocks, as John was describing was part of the design.  Or was it designed for a function and you fit the moon rocks in there?    John Gruener: It was exactly that.    Host: It was the second one?    John Gruener: So, yes.  So we have this spacecraft.  How many suitcases can we take with this, right?  It's like you're planning on a trip.  You just kind of know that there's these overhead bins in the airplane that you can fit your suitcases in, right?  So once the ascent module, the lunar module that would come off of the moon.  And once the command module, once that volume was kind of set and they started putting things in.  It was like okay, now how many suitcases of rocks can we fit in?    Host: Yeah.  Okay.  Now after, of, of course the first Apollo, Apollo XI landing.  That was of fairly short duration, right?  A few hours, I think they were actually walking on the moon?  And collecting rocks and just putting it in there?  But the new technologies started coming out with some of the later missions, right?  Now we have a rover.  I don't know, was there more capability to bring more rocks back?  What was evolving at the time?    John Gruener: Well, there was.    Host: Okay.    John Gruener: So you know, you talked about the size of the Saturn V, and I you know one of my buds in the Apollo in the astronaut office is Don Petit, and I know you've talked with Don Petit a couple of times on this podcast.  And he likes to talk about this thing called the tyranny of the rocket equation.  I don't know if you've heard that from him.  But when you're an aerospace engineer in college.  You learn all about the rocket equation.  And that basically tells you, you know, how fast you have to get moving to get off of the earth and escape earth's gravity.  And get to the moon.  And then how much you need to slow down to get in orbit around the moon.  And then you have to, okay, I got this, the velocity's worked out.  Now I'm trying to send a, a certain amount of mass to the moon.  The spacecraft, the people.  And so mass is a part of that rocket equation.  And the huge chunk of mass is the propellant.  You know, so now that you know the velocities you need.  How much mass you're trying to get somewhere.  Now you can figure out how much propellant you need.  And it was like 80% or so of that big, tall rocket.  Standing on the launchpads during Apollo.  80— , 75-80% of that was just propellant, right?  So the, this rocket equation.  You know, the tyranny of the rocket equation.  It all based on physics.  And of course physics haven't changed since Apollo, so we're still fighting it today.  And, and probably some of you know the biggest breakthrough is with this company called SpaceX. Where now they are reusing their booster stages.  Well, they'll, they'll launch off the pad and then they'll reuse their booster stage.  So you know you save the, the high-technology parts that the rocket engines, the fuel tanks and stuff.  But still, you've going to fill it up with a bunch of propellant because it, it just takes a lot of propellant to get the mass you're trying to get out there.    Host: Yeah.    John Gruener: And then, I think I talked to you, when we were doing the Living Off the Land podcast, you know.  A lot of equations here at NASA, most of them extremely long with a lot of variables.  But the most important equation's real simple.  Mass equals money.  And if you want to send Apollo astronauts to the moon on a huge Saturn V that's just massive.  You have to have massive amounts of money, right?  So the, the Rangers, the surveyors, the lunar orbiters, the smaller spacecraft are a lot easier to get there.  A lot cheaper to get there.  So it's, it's, it's a huge commitment when you're talking about human spaceflight.  And you know, Kennedy, you know, people focus on the technology a lot.  But the cost of Apollo was incredible.  Sometimes up to four percent of the federal budget.  And, and Kennedy realized that.  And he said, \"You know, this is going to wrack some of our social programs.  I understand that.  But this is the second-most important thing as a nation we need to be doing right now.\"    Host: Yeah.  Because it was, because it was ultimately you know it wasn't just get to the moon and pick up rocks.  Which was scientifically astounding.  But at the same time, we had to beat the Soviet Union.  That was a, that was a huge part of it.    John Gruener: And when you're doing things for the first time, you know, from the engineering standpoint, you throw in a lot of margin, right?  So mass margin.  Propulsion margin.  Delta V, change in velocity margin.  And as you are flying these missions to the moon, you start understanding it better.  And so the, our last three missions, Apollo XV, XVI, and XVII, that's where we got the little electric cars that you talked about.  You know, buggies to drive around.  All of that increased capability on the surface of the moon, and bringing more mass to the surface of the moon.  Was because now that we understand our rockets better, we can release some of that margin and actually use it as payload.  So same rocket, but we just understand it better.  So now we can spend three days on the moon instead of one day.  We can bring a little electric car with us.  And we can bring back, you know, close to 100 kilograms of rocks and soil.  Where the first Apollo XI, they brought back a few, you know, tens of kilograms.  So it was an order of magnitude change with the Apollos XV, XVI, and XVII.  And that was all based on understanding our, our rockets better.    Host: Yeah.  So, so to make that possible, Jennifer.  I know like so the whole, NASA as a whole as John said was funneling a lot of money just into the Apollo program.  Is, was you know what percent of all of the agency was just Apollo?  And was, was there just less going on at NASA that allowed us to funnel more money into that single program?  Compared to now with all the different programs we have?    Dr. Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: Well, there were definitely other programs going on.  We did have people looking at space stations very early on.  NASA always wanted a space station.  So there were people looking at future programs.  You know, we, in the middle of working on Apollo, we were still working on Gemini, sending folks up there.  We had been working on Mercury.  We also started working on the Apollo applications program.  Which became known as Skylab.  When we launched Apollo XI, we actually had people working on the design of the space shuttle.  So money was, was being spent on other programs.  And of course you know we used a lot of money for facilities.  I think John was talking a little bit about bringing the lunar curatorial facility online.  When we originally built the Manned Spacecraft Center, that wasn't one of the, the buildings that was built.  No one thought about well, okay, we're going to go to the moon.  What are we going to do with these rocks?   Most of the people working here thought this was an engineering problem.  We need to send men to the moon.  We need to figure out how we're going to do it.  Size was sort of like oh yeah, kind of a moment.  And so we didn't actually start thinking about what we were going to do with those rocks.  Until later when we brought those geoscientists onboard.  And they said of course we're going to the moon.  We're going to get rocks, and then what are we going to do with these rocks?  We gotta keep them pristine.  We gotta make sure that they're protected from earth's atmosphere.  And so we didn't start building our lunar receiving lab until much later.  And then it, it's, it was a little fight actually to bring it here to Houston.  And the original design of that facility was very tiny.  We did not envision what eventually became known as the lunar receiving lab.  We thought we would just bring home some lunar rocks and package them and send them out to principal investigators.  And then other people got involved and said, \"Well, we have to be concerned about potential life forms coming back from the moon.\"  And suddenly this small little lab that we had, became this huge 83,000 square feet facility.   John Gruener: Yeah sadly the lunar receiving lab, it was in Building 37.  And then they built Building 31 where the, the lunar rocks are now.  And all sorts of collections.  It's not just about the moon.  We, we have astromaterials from all over the solar system.    Host: Right.    John Gruener: You know, different collections.  And sadly, Building 37 is set to be demolished right now.  Yeah, and that's where, that's where the original lunar receiving lab was.  That's where the quarantine facility was for the first few missions to Apollo.  But it wasn't big enough just to handle all of these rocks that are coming back from the moon.  You know, the, it's, it's surprising.  You, you look at the calendar from you know '69 to '72.  And, and how often we were going to the moon back then.  And you know every one of those trips brought back more rocks.  It's like where are we going to put these things?  So before Building 31 got built, there were safes, you know, like bank safes all over the center holding little sealed containers of moon rocks.  They were scattered all over site.   Host: Wow.  John Gruener: Until we got Building 31.  And that, that lunar curation facility built.  And so you know, it's kind of fun to, to think about how these moon rocks were just scattered all over.  Because we just didn't have that building yet.    Host: Yeah.  So did the, did the geoscientists and just science in general look at the rocks and have questions already about you know knowing what rocks they wanted to bring and what they wanted to study?  Or was it just get the rocks and we will study it later and figure it out?    John Gruener: Well, you know, people have been looking at the moon for centuries, first with our eyes.  And then as these things called telescopes got bigger and bigger you could look at the moon in ever-increasing detail.  And by looking at the surface features, the topography, the terrain on the moon, geoscientists had a pretty good idea, you know, that those dark areas up there on the moon were going to be some type of lava, you know.  Because you look on earth here and it's dark lava, right?  Coming out of Hawaii and other places.  So they had, you know, they had a pretty good idea of the dark areas on the moon.  Weren't quite sure about the bright areas of the moon.  You know, you look up at the, the moon at night.  And you'll see the dark areas and the bright areas.  And here's a great you know time for a public service announcement.  This Saturday is the International Observe the Moon Night.  And, and so there's stuff going on all over the country here in Houston.  At Space Center Houston.  We'll, we'll, we'll have you know something going on with the Lunar Planetary institute and JSC.  But all over the world, there are these events, you know just to look up at that moon at night.  And, and, and say wow, there it is, and we've been there, right?    Host: Oh yeah.    John Gruener: But those bright areas of the moon we weren't so sure about.  And a matter of fact, on Apollo XVI, that was our real own mission.  Only mission that went to those bright areas of the moon.  They train the astronauts to look for these light-colored volcanic rocks called rhyolite.  Right?  So basalt's really dark.  That's stuff coming out of Hawaii.  So you see these dark lava flows.  You have these beautiful black sand beaches.  That result from the breakdown of those volcanic rocks.  Well, they're also, volcanic rocks are higher in silicon.  And they're, they're much lighter in color.  And so they, they train these Apollo XVI astronauts to look for these felsic you know volcanic rocks.  But they also trained them in other types of rocks and minerals.  And when John Young and Charlie Duke landed there, it was like, you know, they didn't quite say, \"Houston, we have a problem.\"  But they said, \"Hey, this isn't exactly that volcanic landscape you told us it was going to be,\" right?  So then we get these rocks back.  And then, and now we can start formulating ideas on how the moon formed and why are these particular rocks and minerals there?  So we had a broad idea of what we might find on the moon.  But clearly, you know, no real understanding of, about those bright areas.    Host: Yeah, that's one of my favorite parts about the Apollo program is just you, they, they had a mission.  And then they did that mission.  And then the next mission was kind of evolving and doing new things, right?  Let's add a car.  Let's take away margin.  Let's pick up more rocks.  It's, it was just fascinating to see that.  And then just dealing with those challenges as they came along.  Because everything was new, so obviously not everything was going to be perfectly planned.  Including, where are you going to put the moon rocks whenever you get them?    John Gruener: And there's even a program called the Apollo Applications Program, of AAP.  And that was if we use the lander stage that brought, brought the astronauts to the surface of the moon.  And we put a little house on it or a habitat.  Right?  Now we could actually stay on the moon for more than a handful of days.  And we could you know start this idea of a lunar base or a lunar outpost.  Where we were up there for months at a time instead of days at a time.  But none of that ever made it to prime time, you know.  We had Apollos XVIII, XVIIII, and XX in, in the plans.  And those didn't make it into it either.    Host: Right, yeah.  No, I, it was a lot of a funding issue.  Jennifer, I know like as it was going along.  Was it the public interest was sort of kind of falling off?  You know, we landed on the moon and that was like yay!  And then they did it again.  It was like, well this is, this is the same thing.    Dr. Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: Well actually funding started to fall in the mid-sixties under Lyndon Johnson.  We were in the middle of, of fighting the Vietnam War.  We were also fighting a war on poverty.  You know, you couldn't have your guns and butter, like they, they say.  And so you know that, that was part of the issue.  You know, we had had this, this huge budget.  And you actually see it on a graph.  It just sort of declines rather precipitously.  So things had fallen off well before we even landed on the moon or went around the moon.    Host: Yeah.  Now, that was kind of when we started thinking about even missions beyond, too, right?  That's Skylab was sort of let's take this thing that we have and fit it into a space station sort of concept, right?    Dr. Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: Absolutely, yeah.  You know, how can we use some of the equipment that we have for Apollo to create a space station?  And so we start looking at that.  We also start looking at like I said, the Space Shuttle in 1969.  Max Faget comes up with this idea for a reusable spacecraft.  Because we, we couldn't really reuse anything from Apollo.  It was all throwaway.  And so, you know, we come up with this new idea.  It's going to be cheaper.  We're going to fly more regularly.  And we start working on those designs in 1969.  We have people who are about, 20 people who are locked in a room here at JSC working on what's it going to look like?  How's it going to operate?    Host: So that was actually, that's actually a huge part of the Apollo program and one of the difficulties looking forward now.  Is we're talking-- John, you mentioned returning to the moon.  And what are we going to do?  A lot of it is dealing with staying there for a long time.  Learning how to work and live.  But the Apollo program, all of these pieces of technology.  The lunar lander, the, the rovers, the command module.  They were meant for just using that one time.  They had limited consumables, right?  So when you're kind of designing that mission.  Taking away that margin like you said, how, how does that work?  How do you?  Was it, everything just built to be thrown away?  How do you justify the lifespan of the technology itself?    John Gruener: Well, we had that schedule, you know.  Send a man to the moon, return him safely before the end of the decade.  So as long as you have a president pushing this.  And then you have a Congress supporting the president pushing this.  And throwing lots of money at it.  You can make things work, brute force, you know, get it there, get it done.  But you're not thinking long-term operations.  You're not thinking sustainable operations.  So Apollo was not sustainable.  But it wasn't meant to be sustainable.  It was meant to beat the Soviet Union to the moon.    Host: Exactly.  Yep, that makes sense.  So now, now we have, we've used the, the technology to get us to the moon.  We used the technology to get those moon rocks back.  What have we been learning?  You know, we have all of this moon rocks.  We built the facility, put them in.  Now we're, we're looking at them.  What is so interesting about the moon?    John Gruener: Well, I wish I could say we've answered all the questions.    Host: I guess that's a good thing, right?  There's still more.    John Gruener: Oh, there's, there's tons of more questions, right?  But we have a better idea of, of maybe how the moon formed.  Before we went to the moon with Apollo, there were three, you know, major theories or hypothesis on how the moon formed.  One was called the fission theory.  Where there, there, the early proto-earth is, is spinning on its axis really fast.  And it's, you know, it'll throw off a blob or two out into space.  Around the equator where it's spinning the fastest.  And those blobs would eventually form this moon, right?  So that was the fission theory.  But the problem with that is the earth is not spinning fast now.  So what happened to all that angular momentum.  If you're spinning so fast to spin off blobs to make the moon.  Why aren't we spinning that fast now?  So we said okay, maybe that doesn't work.  Then there was the idea that the moon and the earth formed in the same neighborhood at the same time.  In the same neighborhood.  And you know, so it's kind of like a binary planetary system, if you will.  Right?  And when the first moon rocks came back, they were very similar to the earth.  It's like, ah, Coaccretion right?  That, that's, that's the thing that actually happened.  The moon and the earth formed together.  But then there were some small difference.  You know, so well, maybe that doesn't quite work either.  And, and how do you get, again, this, this binary system where the moon's orbiting the earth, right?  How do you get all that to work physics wise?  If they form together in the same neighborhood.  So I don't know, still up in the air.  But it, it was more favored than say the fission theory.  And then there was the capture theory.  That the moon formed somewhere else.  You know kind of the same distance from the sun as the earth.  But, but somewhere else.  And then as the earth and the moon came close together.  The gravity of the earth pulled the moon in, right?  It got it into orbit.  So that was the capture theory.  So those are the three main ideas on how the moon formed.  Well, when then rocks came back.  More and more people started thinking about this.  Says you know?  How about this idea?  You know let's just call it the big whack idea where there's a Mars-sized planet out there.  And it slams into the earth in the, you know, early history of the solar system.  And that collision then throws out or ejects you know all sort of particles and mass into orbit around the earth.  Much of it rains down back on earth.  But some of it stays in orbit.  And then all of that debris from that giant impact formed the moon.  And so that's kind of the prevailing theory right now.  This thing called the giant impact theory for the formation of the moon.  And then when you started looking at the actual minerals of the moon.  It's like, wow.  We think the moon, you know, at least the upper surface of the moon was completely molten at one time.  So you know you think of the Star Wars movies, and Mustafar, where they have those great light saber duels.  And it's a very volcanically active planet, right?  Well, we get these, these rocks and minerals back from the moon.  And the best way we can explain them is that there was a magma ocean, if you will.  On the outer hundreds of kilometers of the surface of the moon, right?  And, and as, as the, the lava or magma cooled, the lighter the rocks, the rocks with the lighter elements in it kind of floated towards the top.  The rocks with the heavier elements kind of sunk to the bottom.  And you kind of have some segregation going on there.  And so this magma ocean hypothesis now has come up.  Not only for the moon, but maybe all of the inner, you know, the planets and the moons in the inner solar system.  So the moon's not only teaching us about how the moon formed, but possibly how the inner solar system formed.  All the different planets.   Host: Wow.  John Gruener: And then you look up at the moon.  You know, we're all going to look at the moon this Saturday, right?  International Observe the Moon Night.    Host: I know I will.    John Gruener: And you look up at the moon.  You see those circular dark features.  And those are big flood lavas.  Basaltic lava, like out of Hawaii.  But before that lava was there, there were huge holes in the ground.  So when something hits the moon, it makes a crater.  Everybody kind of familiar with that term, crater.  But when the crater is huge like continent size, we call them basins.  Impact basins.  And so there's a real question is when did all those basins form on the moon?  And did they form all at once, you know, or relatively near in time?  You know, hundreds of millions of years apart?  Or was there kind of a steady formation over the first couple billion years of the moon?  So we have this thing called the cataclysmic bombardment idea.  That all of these big holes on, on the moon were created pretty much at once.  But if it was happening on the moon, it was also happening at the earth, right?  So we're trying to tie in the, the impact ages of the moon.  And the, the life on earth.  And when did life, you know, what are oldest fossils on the earth?   And how do we tie that into the formation ages of the surface of the moon?  And then the big impact basins.  So what we've learned a lot from the moon is that very early beginning of our inner solar system.  And not just for the moon, but for, you know, Mercury, Venus, Mars, Earth.  All, all of that.  So the moon is just a great laboratory to test ideas and hypothesis on planetary formation and then differentiation between crust and mantle and core.  We learn about all that in junior high school science class.  Right?  So we, we've learned a lot about the moon.  But of course, any time you get into an, an experiment in science.  You answer your maybe your primary question.  But all these secondary questions start to pop up.  And because we brought the rocks back.  We could put them in very detailed scientific instruments.  You know, in laboratories.  And measure things down to the parts per million or parts per billion.  And so now we're, we're trying to understand you know why do these rocks have chlorine in them and these rocks don't?  You know?  So you know and, and that gets into, you know, that whole idea of geochemistry and petrology of the moon, you know.  Really, really fine details have been argued now for, for decades.  And maybe you know, to the, to the common person that kind of stuff doesn't really matter.  But it does.  When you're trying to you know take bits and pieces of space debris and put them together to make a planet.  It, it's all important.    Host: Yeah, that's actually one of my favorite things about—I, I have a lot of astromaterials folks on the podcast because I find it fascinating.    John Gruener: It's a fun place to work.    Host: It, it's super fun.  And you can look at a rock and get this fascinating story about molten lava and this fiery world and bombardment.  And all these fantastic stories all from looking at a rock.  And you can get a history.    John Gruener: Yes, as a matter of fact.  So on Apollo XI, they had one suitcase.  And the astronauts were trained to, you know, pick up the rocks with their, with their devices.  Their little tongs or what not.  Shovels and scoops.  And put the, the rocks into bags, right?  And then seal up the bags.  And put the bags into a box.  And then close the box.  And you know Neil was on the surface.  And he, he looked in this box and it was full of rocks.  But as you know, rocks don't pack perfectly.  So there was a lot of void space.  He just used a shovel.  He started piling dirt into the box to fill up the, the void space.  And that sample which is 10084, so we, we number all of our samples that came back from the moon.  And, and 10084 was just that dirt that Neil decided we need to fill up all this empty space in the suitcase to make this trip really worth it.  And some people look at that, that soil sample.  And you, you can describe the, the formation of the moon from that one soil sample.  Right?  All the other rocks and soils help validate what, what, what you could do with 10084.  But yeah, it's amazing what you can do with just a little bit.    Host: Unbelievable.  So I mean, this was one of those things that was completely new, right?  It's like go to the moon and pick up rocks.  And then when you do, you realize how much space is left over.  So you kind of have to pull an audible and say, \"Alright, let's fill that space.\"  Jennifer, I'm sure you've talked to a lot of folks that have actually walked on the moon.  Can you talk about the difficulties of just adjusting to the one-sixth g?  And what they were learning from each other as time went on?  And more and more people started walking on the moon?    Dr. Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: You know, I’m try to think about—We have talked to a number of people who have walked on the moon.  But I don't think any of them have talked about necessarily the difficulty that they encountered.  I think more what they talk about is just the beauty of the moon.  And our place in the, the solar system.  And how in awe they were of, of being on the moon.  And this great accomplishment.  And the opportunity that they had as an astronaut to be in the lunar surface.  And the contributions that they and other people made to the Apollo program.  I think it was just a once in a lifetime opportunity for them.  You know, people like you know Gene Cernan and Harrison Schmitt.  All of those guys, you know.  It's just, it was an amazing opportunity.    John Gruener: And, and Buzz Aldrin, you know, he said this is magnificent desolation.  What a great way to describe that, the lunar surface, right?    Host: Yeah.  John Gruener: Because it is magnificent, but it is desolate.  There's nothing there.    Host: Right.    John Gruener: As, as, as you know, human explorers have gone all over this planet.  But we always encounter other peoples.  Or other animals, right?  Or other plants.  And of course none of that was on the moon.    Host: Right.    John Gruener: Do you know what?  We're talking a lot about those, those Apollo missions that went down to the surface of the moon.  Coming up here in a couple months, December will be the 50th anniversary of Apollo VII, VIII, right?    Host: Right, right.    John Gruener: And that photograph that they call earthrise.  So as the space, spacecraft were coming around from the back side of the moon.  You know, now you can start seeing the earth again.  And because of the motion of the spacecraft.  It kind of looked like the earth was rising into the sky, right?  And they scrambled to get their cameras in to take this picture.  And it made the cover of Time magazine.  And, and really, you know, a lot of people credit that photograph of, of the earth from the moon helping start the big environmental movement.  That you know we have a very fragile planet.  We'd better take care of it.  You don't see political boundaries from the moon.   Host: Right.  John Gruener: So you know those experience, those personal experiences that those, those guys had.  Were, were just tremendous.  And it's fun to talk to them about that.  So in the science world, we, we do bring, we did bring those guys back for discussions during the.  About ten years ago, we had the Constellation program.  And we were talking about going back to the moon.  And so the, the engineers who designed the spacesuits.  The scientist who want to do things on the moon.  We had a lot of discussions.  So how did those spacesuits work on Apollo?  And the question, and the answer was not very well.  You know, it kept them alive, but there was no mobility in the waist.  Very hard to walk.  Right?  So it was that lower-body mobility that they're really trying to get into the new suits.  For our return to the moon.  The gloves particularly were very hard to work.  So, so they're working real hard.  Amy Ross and others are working real hard to make nice gloves that you can use more easily.  The problem with spacesuits.  You know, you, you're like the Michelin man, you blow up.  And so you have to basically fight against the spacesuit to make it move.  Whether you want to open your hand.  Open your hand, you're pushing against the glove to open your hand.  You're pulling against the glove to close your hand.  And those, the Apollo astronauts, their hands were just wore out.   Host: Right.  John Gruener: Even the, the three days missions.  You know, Jack Schmitt will say, \"I couldn't have done more.\"  Because after those three days, you are just wore out from fighting your suit.  Trying to do the science that were on the agenda, right?  So, so scientists.  We have guys like Trevor Graff and Kelsey Young, geoscientists working with the suit designers now to try to get suits that work better on the surface of the moon that will allows scientists to bend over, to pick up a rock.  Or, because you, you know, there are blooper reels of these guys falling down.  Host: Right.  John Gruener: All over the moon, right?  And you know, it was mostly when they were trying to bend over to pick something up.  And of course they pop back up.  Because it was, it was easy with the one-six gravity.    Host: Yeah, yeah.  John Gruener: But it is a difficult place to get used to and to work.    Host: So by the end, what, how?  You said they were there for three days.  How long were those spacewalks that made it so tiring?    John Gruener: They're always less than eight hours, you know.  So think about your eight-hour work day.  Host: That’s still three days in a row.  John Gruener: Right, three days in a row, exactly.  So, so nowadays, we talk about future missions to the moon.  We talk about rotating the crews.  Very much like we did on the Space Shuttle.  Where we would have a Hubble Telescope repair mission.  And on one day, two astronauts would go out.  And then on the next day, two different astronauts would go out.  And then on the third day, maybe the same astronauts from the first day would go out so these, this idea of alternating crews.  And give them a day off in between EVAs to rest.  That's kind of what we're talking about with the moon.  And, and, and that's why that, you know, that, those long-term stays start to pay off.  Because if you and I wanted to go to Orlando and go to you know Disney World or Orlando, you know, the Studios there with Harry Potter World, and all that stuff.  We could go there.  You know, it's, most of the money is getting there, right?  And we could spend 30 minutes there, a couple hours there like Apollo XI.  But would we really get our money's worth?  You know, at Disney World if we only went there for 30 minutes to a couple hours?  Right?    Host: Right.  John Gruener: You want to spend the entire day.  You spent all this money and time and energy to get to Disney World.  You want to spend some time there and enjoy the rides.  And it's much the same thing with the moon.  So we know it's a hard environment to work in.  So you know, just use our smarts and, and rotate the crews.  And protect the crews.  You know, that's our number-one job here at JSC is the safety of the crews.   Host: Absolutely.  John Gruener: So we can't give them an impossible task to do on the moon.  But they, those guys in Apollo were, were giants.  I mean, they worked like Hercules out there, what they did on those three-day missions.    Host: Right.  Yeah, they were all mostly, well I think most of them were test pilots except for Jack Schmitt, right?    John Gruener: Scientist, yeah.    Host: Scientist, yeah.  So he was the one.  I'm sure he, you're, he's still very involved in the community, right?    John Gruener: Oh yes, yes.  We're getting ready to have a meeting in just a couple weeks.  Lunar exploration analysis group.  We meet once a year.  And Jack's always there.  And man is, is does he add to the conversation.    Host: Yeah, really well too.  Because you can all talk about the moon.  And he can say, \"Well, when I was there.\"  [Laughter] So he's got that on his side.  So Jennifer, I kind of wanted to end on, on this note.  Well actually first, I have a super-random question that I, it's just-- .    Dr. Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: Is it trivia?    Host: Well, yeah.  Well, it's something that has always been in the back of my mind.  I, I'm thinking about the Apollo XI landing, them actually landing on the moon.  You see Neil Armstrong get out of the lunar module and actually jump out and touch the lunar suit, surface.  How did the camera get there?  Did it shoot out from the lunar module once it landed?  Do you know?    Dr. Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: I'm not 100% sure.    Host: I've always been curious.    John Gruener: Yeah, so they did have externally mounted cameras.  And I'm not sure if it was on one of these little, you know, crisscross things that, that, that kind of telescope out you know.  To, to, you know, flop out one direction.  I'm not exactly sure either.    Host: Okay.    Dr. Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: How it was done.  I watched it as a kid.  I mean, we talked about the early '60s and, and John Gruener was a little boy growing up here in Houston.  Watching all this stuff.  And so you know, we happened to be in New Orleans when, when Apollo XI happened.  And I always was fascinated with well why can't we see right through these guys?  They're like ghosts.  Those early television images.  If you watch the Apollo XI guy.  You can see through them.  And I never understood that.  I'm not a photography guy.  But that's, we kept asking our parents.  \"Are they really there?  Because you can see right through them.\"    [ Laughter ]    Host: Yeah, those early, early TVs.  Alright, sorry that was a random, random question.    Dr. Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: No, and I hate to be-- .    Host: It's just something as the public affairs guy.  That's the part, stuff that gets to me.  It's just like how did they get that footage?  Where's that, where's that footage coming from?  And like the livestreaming capability.  I was always wondering.    John Gruener: And part of geologic training was to get the astronauts to take pictures of the rocks on the moon.  And up-close pictures, surface of the moon.  Well, Neil Armstrong had that camera on his chest.  Right?  So you see lots of picture of Buzz Aldrin on the moon from Apollo XI.  There are almost no pictures of Neil Armstrong on the moon.  The ones we do have are from those external camera that you talked about when he went down the ladder.  And also there are pictures where you can see Neil as a reflection in Buzz's visor.  They had those gold visors to protect them from the bright sun.  And you can see Neil in that visor.  But he had the camera.    Host: Right.    John Gruener: So my wife always complains about that.  We have all these vacation pictures, and I'm never in them!  [Laughter] So luckily there's things called selfies now, right?    Host: Yes, yes.  Need a selfie stick.  See there's a good Apollo technology.    John Gruener: Neil needed a selfie stick on the moon.    Host: A selfie stick, there you go.  But I do, I do want to end with this note.  Jennifer, you were talking about the astronauts talking about the beauty of the moon.  What were some of the things that really stuck out to you when you were talking with them?  Whether it was the beauty of the moon or the view of earth from the moon?  What were some of the things that stuck out?    Dr. Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: Well, some of the things that, that John was talking about.  Just the fact that, that earth seemed so fragile from where they were, you know?  You couldn't see the boundaries of countries or nations.  It was just one planet.  And you know, they were really struck by this blue marble in a sea of blackness.  It really stood out.  And it was such a unique place compared to other, other places like the moon.  Which was so stark and so desolate.    Host: Right.  John Gruener: And for those Apollo guys on the surface of the moon, they always saw earth, home, up in the sky.  Because all of the missions from Apollo were on the front side of the moon.  We never sent Apollo astronauts to the far side of the moon or the back side of the moon, right?    Host: Yes.  John Gruener: Matter of fact, no real spacecraft has done a mission back there yet.  The later this year, the, the Chinese are getting ready to launch Chang'e-4 and that will be the first spacecraft of any type.  To land on the far side of the moon.    Host: Wow.  John Gruener: So you know, just that, that draw to home.  There's home waiting for us.  Finish our work, and we get to go home, and there it is.  So some people worry about that with Mars.  You know, you go all the way to Mars.  And of course earth is not there in the sky.  It is, but it's teeny-tiny.  It's a little blue dot in the sky right?  But what will those people who work and live on Mars for long periods of time, how will they feel?  Because earth is so far away and they can't see home.  You know?    Host: Yeah, no that's a big thing.  I talked with a lot of folks from the human research program about isolation and confinement.  And what that does, especially for missions where you would be on Mars for a very long time.  And it's, it's real.  So you'd have to have that sort of connection.  Definitely something we need to explore.  And it's, it's an interesting point just to look up and say huh.  That's, that's everyone I know.  You know, everyone I know, everyone I've ever known is on just that little level of circle.  It's got to be just a profound feeling.  And I hope something that more people get to, get to talk about in the future, too.  Whenever we're talking about these upcoming lunar missions.  Just to see, get that perspective once again.  It's going to be fantastic.    John Gruener: Right, because it's not just NASA or the other space agencies like China.  We're starting to get commercial industry involved as well.  And commercial companies are now, you know, working on delivering things to the moon, including people.  So the hope and dream is that the commercial companies can not only take NASA astronauts to the moon, but they can take citizens to the moon as well.  To experience it.    Host: Yeah, for all mankind.  I love it.  [Laughter] Or humankind.  There you go.  Alright, so John and Jennifer, thank you so much for coming on!  This was, this was better than I expected, honestly.  Because I, I was kind of, I was kind of thinking like how are we going to combine the history and the science?  But I, I think it worked, and I really appreciate your time today.    John Gruener: Sure, it was fun.    Dr. Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: Thanks for inviting us.    [ Music ]    Host: Hey, thanks for sticking around.  So today we talked with Dr. Jennifer Ross-Nazzal.  And Mr. John Gruener about Apollo and the moon.  We went into the history and explored some of the science and how this is all going to help us here in the future.  So like I said, in the intro, we are in the middle of the 50th anniversary of the Apollo program and the missions that coincide with that.

Gary Jordan (Host): Houston, we have a podcast.  Welcome to the official podcast of the NASA Johnston Space Center, episode 72, The International Space Station Begins, Part 1.  I'm Gary Jordan, and I'll be your host today.  On this podcast, we bring in the experts, scientists, engineers, and astronauts, all to let you know the coolest information about what's going on here at NASA.  So, 20 years ago, on November 20, 1998, the first element of the International Space Station called Zarya was launched to space.  It was the first step towards two decades of international cooperation, scientific research, and discovery.  We're sort of used to talking about the International Space Station now.  Crews come and go on long duration journeys, and during each journey, the astronauts are conducting hundreds of experiments, doing space walks, and making it all look relatively routine.  But, of course, to get to this point, you had to start somewhere, and that was with Zarya, the first element of the space station.  Designed, constructed, and flown as a joint effort between Russia and NASA.  It was a critical step and a critical module to provide power, propulsion, guidance, and all the essentials that would enable the first modules to be attached and to function properly.   So, with me to tell this story of the first element is Doug Drewry, the former FGB Program Manager and launch package manager for the mission.  You hear us say FGB a lot.  It stands for Functional Cargo Block, but a G instead of a C since it's translated from Russian.  Doug had a variety of jobs during his 22 years at NASA, including leading the joint U.S. and Russian teams for the successful development and launch of Zarya.  He's now the president and owner of his own aviation company.  So, with no further delay, let's jump right ahead to our talk with Doug Drewry to tell the story of our first steps in this, the 20th anniversary of the International Space Station.  Enjoy.    [ Music ]    Host: Doug, thank you so much for coming on the podcast today to celebrate 20 years of the International Space Station.    Doug Drewry: Thanks for having me.    Host: All right.  We're going to take it all the way back and even beyond that, I think, because 20 years ago was the actual launch of Zarya.  But, it started even before that, and it started even before it was Zarya.  So, sort of set the scene.  Before this even came into place, what was happening at NASA?  Where were we?    Doug Drewry: Well, we started the space station back, way back with space station Alpha.  That evolved into space station Freedom.  We went through several redesigns of space station Freedom.  There was a major redesign a few years before we started talking to the Russians.  It was called preintegrated truss redesign where I ended up leading the MB3 and MBA which was the S1 and P1 segments that are on orbit today.  It's the preintegrated truss.  And then, we went up to our critical design review on that when there was another station redesign.  We were, at the time, we were divided into work packages.  JSC was work package two.  I don't remember which, who had all the other work packages, but you had power being done out of one place and all these various things.  So, anyway, we were told to redesign, and with a new inclination, we were supposed to go to 51.6 degrees of inclination which we knew is where the Russians were flying.  But, of course, every time we queried that, it was denied that anything to do with it.  It was just supposed to be another redesign of the station which we'd been through so many times before for budget cuts and this and that.    Host: Right.    Doug Drewry: JSC did an option C which was a single launched orbit, and SLC option which was basically modifying a shuttle external tank and fitting it out with the various levels.  Marshall took basically the Freedom design, much like the current space station, and instead of backing the work package two days where we were launching outboard in, we were launching solar rays first and propulsion modules so we would have command control on orbit.  And, we kind of built up to the point where we built the truss first and then added the pressurized modules and brought in crew.  Marshall took the approach of bringing out the modules first and then building outward on the truss to power them.    Host: So, several different, I mean, this is a very dynamic time with the, this idea of a space station is there, but, what, you know, how do we make this a possibility.  And, everyone's redesigning it, trying to come up with the right strategy.  You're going through design reviews but don't even know what the space station is going to look like at this point.  But, you understand that maybe there's some collaboration coming down the road.    Doug Drewry: Well, space station Freedom was really pretty far along, and it's, I mean, we were cutting metal and building hardware already.    Host: Oh, okay.    Doug Drewry: And, it's largely the U.S. segment that's on orbit today.  It's just the approach for putting it together was radically different.  Again, one of the politically expedient things was to get crew on orbit as soon as possible.  And, under the Freedom program, we were a few years into the building segments out before we brought crew on board.  So, at shuttle flights, we would leave it on orbit for a period of time.  And so, there was a real effort to change that.  The last redesign that threw in the 51.6 inclination really hurt us performance wise.  That took about 30% of the shuttle's carrying capability out to go to that higher inclination orbit.    Host: Oh, really?    Doug Drewry: So, that was a big impact on.  We couldn't just fly the preintegrated truss segments like in the modules like we had planned with Freedom because the shuttle didn't have the carrying capability now at the higher inclination.  So, one of the things Marshall did on their option, they were option A, I believe, is they offloaded racks and things in the modules.  We did different things to the truss to try to lighten it up and be able to carry it up to that higher inclination.  So, bottom line is Marshall was announced as the winner of the competition that we were going to build space station Alpha, I think it was.  That was the other one it was called at first.  And in the meantime, there were a few of us pulled off to the side and said, \"Well, let's see if we can integrate the Russians into this.\"    Host: Hmm.    Doug Drewry: And, we went through weeks and weeks of meetings in Crystal City to meet with Russian counterparts and mostly people from RSA at the time.  Although, honestly, I was involved in a lot of those meetings and Khrunichev representatives were there.  And, I don't remember them ever being introduced as being anything other than with the Russian contingent that they were part with RSA or Energia.    Host: Oh.    Doug Drewry: So, the bottom line is we came up with a viable assembly sequence, had the service module as the first element.  And, the node was several elements down before we could get it up.  Because, again, we had that problem.  You have to, once you put something on orbit, you have to be able to drive it around the sky.  So, you have to have propulsion.  You have to have command and control.  You have to have an ability to keep it up there, re-boost if necessary.  So, we've, at some point, formally adapted, or adopted that we were going to be working with the Russians.    Host: Okay.    Doug Drewry: And, interestingly, in, it was October of '93, I got a phone call on a, I believe it was on a Thursday about noon said go over to building x and get your picture taken, you're flying to Russia tomorrow.  And, I met several other people from here that were in the same boat.  We were all getting out picture taken.  They explained to us that our passports would be meeting us, we'd be stopping D.C. on the way over, and they'd meet us there with our passports and our VISAs.  And, mine was one of two that didn't make into D.C., so I spent an extra night in D.C. I flew into Moscow the next day, and we spent, I want to say we spent about a week meeting with the Russians again.  Dave Mobley from Marshall led that team.  There was probably, I don't remember the number.  Close to 20 of us, 18 to 20 of us that went over there.    Host: Wow.    Doug Drewry: And, this was, this was right about the time they were, the Russian tanks had fired on the White House in Moscow.  So.    Host: Politically, it was.    Doug Drewry: It was an interesting time to be there.    Host: Interesting time, yeah.    Doug Drewry: I remember my first impressions of flying into Moscow was it was all black and white.  Except for the red stars and red pictures of Lenin on the sides of every building and statues everywhere.    Host: Wow.    Doug Drewry: And, as a contrast to when we left, I tell everybody it was in pastels.  It was a totally different place than when we first flew in.  But.    Host: Wow.  And, why the speed?  Why were you, why'd you have to go so fast?    Doug Drewry: We were sent over, the direction we were given was that call it a semiofficial however you want to couch that.  But, we were told we needed to go, come up with a, we, the Soviet Union has, was breaking up.  They needed money desperately.  Our White House had decided that we were going to give them money to keep them from selling nuclear weapons to other people to raise cash.    Host: Okay.    Doug Drewry: And, NASA was one of the mechanisms to do that.  So, we were sent over specifically with the directive that the first module had to be a U.S. module, and the U.S. astronauts had to be onboard before Russian astronauts.    Host: Okay.    Doug Drewry: And, so we went over, and we tried, oh, for a good week to try to manipulate the sequence to make that happen, and there's just no way because, again, we needed that command and control function up front.  And, meekly, out of the back of the room, this gentleman stands up and said, \"Well, we could do that with an FGB.\"  And, we broke into that discussion for the next rest of the day, and it turned out it was Khrunichev suggesting what became the FGB.  It was based on one of their, one of their military vehicles that they've built, they've used for many years, I guess.    Host: So, FGB did not originally mean Functional Cargo Block.    Doug Drewry: No, it was always Functional Cargo Block.    Host: Oh, I see.    Doug Drewry: But, that's different than the FGB that we're applying on orbit.    Host: Okay.  Okay.    Doug Drewry: Yeah.  Quite interestingly, and we thought we had agreement, and we came in the next morning, and Energia and RSA told us that wasn't going to work.  And, we threatened to walk out after half a day and leave Moscow.  And, they finally agreed to meet with us again, and that afternoon, the administrator and Bill Shepherd who is the program manager at the time for space station, he flew over with George Abbey and we met with them in the afternoon, told them what was going on, and he next day, we briefed the concept with the FGB to Goldin and Koptev.    Host: Wow.    Doug Drewry: Which was the head of the Russian Space Agency.    Host: So, this was definitely not a straightforward process.    Doug Drewry: Oh, no.  It was— [laughter] In fact, when, interestingly, when we were actually doing the briefing to Koptev and Goldin the next day, the Russians, again, objected.  In Russian this time.  And Koptev called an end to the meeting and sent all the Americans out of the room and called us back in about 30 minutes later and said we could get on with the meeting now.  And, what he explained to us is that RSA had objected.  One of the things they said was that, you know, the FGB, some of the systems were built in the Ukraine, and you know how those Ukrainians are.  And, Koptev proceeded to tell us that the Ukrainians built the systems for the Energia modules as well, and so, it was really a nonargument.  It was just another attempt to keep Khrunichev out of the loop, I think.  And, bottom line is we left Moscow with an agreement, with an assembly sequence, and it had the FGB.  It was the best we could do is the FGB was the first element.  The node was the second element.  So, we would get a U.S. module up before the service module.  Our direction had been a U.S. lab before the Russian lab, but we, the node was the best we could do because, again, we needed some power.    Host: Yeah.    Doug Drewry: And, basically, we flew up 2A with the node as the second flight, and then it was almost a year before the service module would come up as the third flight.    Host: Right.    Doug Drewry: So.    Host: Yeah, it was just the two for a while, but.    Doug Drewry: Yeah.  Yeah, we drove it around for about a year.  That's where we had to put a lot of requirements on the FGB.  Basically, the FGB is the keystone of the space station.  It's the thing that holds the Russian segment and the U.S. segment together.  It's got all the fluid power, A/C, all the interfaces go through that module and had to be built into that module.    Host: Yeah.    Doug Drewry: It's bigger than the Russian original core module was.  It's got a different power system.  We had to run on 120 volt power to be compatible with the U.S. stuff.  We put that docking ball in the front which is bigger than anything the Russians had ever done.  Which, in we had to build, build in an APAS or a docking system to dock with the shuttle because 2A was going to come up and dock to that, and we wanted to be able to do that.  We had to make the solar arrays retractable.  We've got U.S. computers in the module, MDMs and things.  So, it's radically different than anything the Russians had done before.    Host: Was this kind of decided after all the meetings and, or was it—?    Doug Drewry: Yeah. At that meeting in Moscow, we came up with this sequence.    Host: Sure.    Doug Drewry: And then, we actually left that meeting with the FGB was going to be a Russian contribution to the space station.  And, they were supplying it.  Sometime, I believe, in November, they came over, this would be November '93.  And, we agreed to pay I think it was $7.9 million for modifications that we needed to their hardware to the FGB to make it do some of the functions we did.    Host: And, that included the docking mechanism, the solar arrays, or were these separate?    Doug Drewry: It included some of those things.  Some of them came up later.  I mean, it's just like any other design.    Host: Sure.    Doug Drewry: Viewgraph engineering.  It looks good on paper, and as you actually started building, you started to run into other things.    Host: Yeah.    Doug Drewry: So, we did make a lot of modifications along the way.    Host: Okay.    Doug Drewry: But, I had a full-time team of U.S. specialists and Russian specialists.  We actually built an office in the Khrunichev plant in Moscow.  Which showed up as a park on their maps.  It was, Khrunichev was primarily a military supplier, I guess, you would.    Host: Oh, interesting.    Doug Drewry: And, yeah, so you couldn't find it on a map.  And, it was an interesting place to be.    Host: Wow.  Yeah.  So, that was kind of interesting because it didn't just, you didn't just start and everything was collaborative.  You know, it was, it was definitely a process to get to where you needed to be, which was a module that was both a U.S. and Russian module that worked for the purpose of, like you said, holding the space station together.    Doug Drewry: Sure.  Yeah.  And, we, so we, it was a big collaborative effort from the beginning on we all recognized we were going to have to make modifications, and they were going to be pretty serious modifications.    Host: Yeah.    Doug Drewry: But, we were still, it was still couched as part of the Russian contribution of the station.  It wasn't until we were probably six months into the design, working with Russians on a daily basis and multiple trips there, and stuff, that all of a sudden, we got word from headquarters one day saying that the Russians had come to them saying the FGB was a solution to our political problem.    Host: Oh, boy.    Doug Drewry: That the old sequence would have worked fine, and therefore, we should be paying for it.  And, Boeing took over as a prime contractor.  So.    Host: Oh, okay.    Doug Drewry: But, part of that decision to, for us to fund the FGB included, I insisted that we have to have better access to the hardware.  And, that's where they ended up building an office just inside the plant wall.  We had an outside entrance we could get into it without going through their security every time.  And, I kept it staffed with two people, and we were in and out of there all the time and in the plant.  It was such a different environment working with the Russians than what we were used to on the U.S. side.  We, and, again, keep in mind this was a, was an ex-military hardware for them, or maybe current military hardware.  And so, every time we wanted to see design details, we basically got to the point where I would send one or two people from our meeting there, whoever had the most direct interest.  They would take them back into a vault room, pull out the original drawings, and on the U.S. side, you know, we did everything electronically.   We had drawings and everything.  On the Russian side, they pulled out original hard copy prints, and you could see initials for changes through the years for the last 15 years and every time they'd made a change.  So, it was really a different way of doing business from what we had seen originally.    Host: Wow.  Yeah, so not only was the actual collaborating on who does what and everything, but just the different way to do things, a different process.    Doug Drewry: Oh, entirely.    Host: Yeah.  That's interesting.  And, a different language to communicate through.    Doug Drewry: It was, of course we had interpreters.    Host: Yeah.    Doug Drewry: All the time.  And, a lot of our people picked up Russian along the way.  I think I've forgotten more Russian than I learned.  But, yeah, it was very interesting.  It was an interesting time to be over there.    Host: Okay.  So, tell me about actually going over and the actual working part.  So, you're in Moscow.  You're in this park, I guess.  Working on all of this, but, you know, some it, like, I think is manufactured in Ukraine.  Did I get that right?    Doug Drewry: No.  It was just some of the components.    Host: Components were from Ukraine.    Doug Drewry: Some of the GNC components were made there.    Host: Okay.    Doug Drewry: You know, Russia, one of the things we ran into going over there was that, and one of the problems, frankly, I had with the contractors on the first part on our side was, in our own contracting office, was the way we do business in the U.S. is we try to figure out a fair market value for something and try to understand what the actual costs are.  When we got, and one of the things when we first got to Moscow is we heard that their engineers hadn't been paid for six months or something.    Host: Oh, wow.    Doug Drewry: That they were in such bad shape.  One of the things, a couple things learned on that was that first it was virtually impossible to figure out what costs really were because the whole Russia Soviet Union things was basically a, almost a barter system where the government supplied everything.  So, the government, the people in the power plants got food and supplies and things they needed, and they supplied the power to the refineries that smelted the metal.  And, they got what they needed, and they supplied it to here and there.  And so, basically, when we get down to the aerospace level, the people at Khrunichev or Energia or RSA really didn't know what the materials cost and really didn't know what labor cost.  The whole thing about the Russians not being paid, I asked one of them one time on one of those early meetings.  I said, \"So, if you haven't been paid for six months, why are you still here?\"   And, he shrugged his shoulders and said, \"What else would I do?\"  And, it turned out that they actually lived in company housing.  Their food and supplies were supplied by the company.  In this case, the company is technically the government.  And that, you know, the pay that they didn't get was their incidental, you know, their play money is kind of what it was.  So, it wasn't like they were like here you didn't get a paycheck and you didn't know how you were going to eat or pay your rent.  That was all taken care of for them.    Host: Wow.    Doug Drewry: And so, it was, it was really a hard thing for people on our side to understand.  It took me quite a while to understand.    Host: Yeah.    Doug Drewry: And, one of the biggest frustrations that I had early on, and I think, unfortunately set the stage for where we are today is I would go over there with a team of people, and I'd usually bring, you know, 10 to 12 people with me when I'd travel or different technical experts, but we would sit down, and we would, over a week, negotiate a deal on something.    Host: Well, once we did, you know, come up with an agreement whether or not it was.    Doug Drewry: Right, right.    Host: The most efficient agreement, you know, we came up with an agreement, and they got what they needed to build certain hardware.  You're in Moscow.  Where is everything being built?  Where is everything being tested?  How is it being relayed back to the U.S.?    Doug Drewry: We were, we were actually building the FGB in the Khrunichev plant there is Moscow.    Host: Okay.    Doug Drewry: We were bringing U.S. components over there.  You know, there was, when we set up the contract, one of the things that they wanted was to build a test article.  They wanted to build a flight article and a test article which we had originally had back in the early days of space station.  But, that's one of the things we had scrubbed out along the way is this duplicate hardware.  And, we had to come up with a different way to figure out how we were going to integrate modules since the first time they would physically see them, each other would be on orbit in a lot of cases.    Host: Right.    Doug Drewry: And, that's one of the things that happened with the FGB, too.  So, we were, we were doing a lot of integration work on both sides.  We, I almost constantly had people in Moscow, depending on what stage of the build we were in, what was going on.  The full-time representatives that I had in our FGB office there kept us informed much better than we would have otherwise.  We, not many people know, I think, but the FGB that's on orbit today was actually cut in half at one point because it actually was over tested and blew out the end of a module during a test.    Host: Really?    Doug Drewry: Yes.  And, one of the ways we found out about that was we found out immediately because of our resident people there in that plant.  And, it took, it was a fight to make sure we had our people involved in the resolution of the problem, and ultimately, we decided jointly with the Russians that they would cut the end of the module off and weld a new piece on, and that's the one that's on orbit.  So you know, the team did a great job.    Host: It's welded, and of course tested to make sure—    Doug Drewry: Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.    Host: And it's held for this long, so.    Doug Drewry: Oh yeah, yeah, we had an original requirement to, our build life was supposed to be ten years with renewable to 15 years.  And, obviously, we're going up on, we're coming up on 20 now.    Host: Yeah.    Doug Drewry: And, you know, and I don't see any problems for going further, so.    Host: So, how was the, how are the teams in Moscow rotated out?  Did they stay there for a couple of years?  Was it an every couple of months sort of?    Doug Drewry: No.  On the FGB team, now there were people, interestingly, while we were over there.  I mean, some of the, some of the people involved are in great positions in NASA right now.  Bill Gerstenmaier, he was in Moscow full-time trying to get the control center built up.    Host: Oh.    Doug Drewry: And, Mark Geyer's the center director here.  He was brought on as my schedules guy for FGB.  And, Kirk Shireman is the Space Station Manager.  He was my GNC guy.  So.    Host: All right.    Doug Drewry: Basically, what I did is from the program office is I took subsystem specialists.  I had mostly out of the engineering directorate.  I had a small staff that was full-time FGB.  The rest were all the technical experts that we pulled for all the subsystems from across the whole center.  And, mostly, out of engineering.  And, we developed relationships with direct counterpart for them in Moscow at Khrunichev.  In some cases at Energia.  And, they, the teams, my biggest job is trying to support everything that they needed to do to do their jobs to make things happen, you know.    Host: Yeah.    Doug Drewry: They were the technical expertise.  My job was to make the decisions and give them direction.    Host: Right.    Doug Drewry: You know, my classic example is you've got a power team and a thermal team.  And, the power team is trying to generate as much power as they can, which, of course, a byproduct of that his heat.  The thermal team's trying to cool everything down the best they can which will freeze everything if you let them.  And, my job was to say, okay, you know, here's where we're going to cut this.  We need a balance here, and it's crossed in all the systems, the integration work.  So.    Host: Okay.    Doug Drewry: But, I rely very heavily on the real experts on their respective systems.    Host: Okay.    Doug Drewry: And, the way we ended up signing the certificational flight readiness, you'll see the U.S. signature, the Russian signature, British counterpart, the Boeing subsystem signature for each of the subsystems, and then I sign, and then, I think, Randy Brinkley was the program manager at the time.  He signed, and the Russians signed.  So, we've got accountability all the way through.    Host: Okay.    Doug Drewry: So, back to your question.  My teams, there was almost constantly someone there, in addition to the locals we had in the office.  Depending on the phase we were in, sometimes there wasn't anybody there.  Other times, we would, we would have technical interchange meetings, probably every two to three months where we would take the whole team over either there or bring the Russians here and work out the details, particularly if we were making a modification or had an issue on something.  At other times, it was smaller teams, groups of five to seven that we would send one way or the other, again, just to work things out.    Host: So, with that much going back and forth and with a lot of the folks based here in Houston, how did you oversee the project, then, from the states?    Doug Drewry: Well, we, again, we were in Russia lot.    Host: Yeah, yeah, yeah.    Doug Drewry: Delta became a very friendly airline to us.    Host: Oh, I see.  I see.  Okay.    Doug Drewry: At one point, George Abbey actually chartered an airline, one of the old government charters.    Host: Okay.    Doug Drewry: To charter us back and forth because we were carrying so many people back and forth.    Host: So many people so often.    Doug Drewry: We were constantly, I mean, you know, it's like anything else.  We're in constant communication.    Host: Yeah.    Doug Drewry: Phone, emails.    Host: Yeah.    Doug Drewry: Computer links.  We're doing all these things.  You know, so we had the, we had the technical side as well as the contract side.  I mean, this was something that had never been done before, a collaboration like this.  Because it truly was a joint effort.  This wasn't a piece of Russian hardware that we gave a few pieces to.  It wasn't U.S. hardware that the Russians had input on.  We worked very hard on this as, and I would say it, you know, again, it's the module's different from the original Russian module that's got all this integration in it.  One of the things you carried over, some of the interesting things that, unique things about the FGB is since it was originally a Russian contribution, it kind of put us in a bad spot when all of a sudden they said we agreed that we were going to pay for the FGB because it was launched on a Russian proton.  And, I wanted to avoid suddenly them coming back and saying, \"Well, now you've got to pay for the rocket and you've got to pay for the fairing to put on it.\"   And so, I rewrote the contract, or wrote the contract that we ended up signing with all that integrated, that they were still responsible for supplying this stuff because.    Host: Sure.    Doug Drewry: Our hands were full trying to build the module.    Host: Right.    Doug Drewry: And, you know, I mean, things from load testing.  You know.  I mean, I had people out there doing load testing, and we were running tests back here to verify things.  And, we were busy on the technical side.  So.    Host: Yeah.    Doug Drewry: We ended up having to waive some of the FARs to do some of the stuff we were trying to do.    Host: FAR?    Doug Drewry: Federal Acquisition Regulations.    Host: Okay.  Okay.    Doug Drewry: There's a set of, you know, they govern everything that NASA or the government buys.  And, some of those things just wouldn't work for what we were trying to do.  One of the things is that on, when a contractor builds a piece of hardware and delivers it to the government, there's a DD250 that basically transfers title.  Well, I deferred that until the FGB docked with the service module because that was the first on orbit.  Well, the first test was, you know, other than all the ground testing.  The first test was successfully getting to orbit.  That was a milestone.  Successfully mating with the node was another milestone.    Host: Right.    Doug Drewry: And, that kind of checked out the other end.  The next thing was until the service module's docked, we couldn't verify all those interfaces, so I put off the DD250 until after the service module was docked.  And then, still held some money until we pulled into, subtracted the solar rays because that's something that was not standard on a Russian, on any of the Russian designs.  And so.    Host: Yeah.  So, even the negotiations were ongoing, even throughout all that.    Doug Drewry: There was always something going on.    Host: Yeah.  I bet.    Doug Drewry: Always, and trying to get hardware back and forth was interesting.  I mean, we hand carried the mating, or the docking targets, the PMA targets to do the shuttle docking with that were installed on orbit or installed on the module before launch.    Host: Right.    Doug Drewry: Because we just had so much trouble getting things through customs sometimes.  Even, you know, it's kind of unbelievable the way people pulled together to make this happen in some cases.    Host: Wow.  Yeah.  That's true because sure.  Yeah.  Instead of going through customs, you just avoid that and go above it.    Doug Drewry: Well, no.  It's not really avoiding that.  It's that, let's put it this way.  NASA had no special favors trying to go through U.S. or Russian customs.    Host: Sure.    Doug Drewry: Just because we have NASA stickers and critical space hardware all on it, sometimes that stuff would still get hung up.    Host: Yeah.    Doug Drewry: You had to go through bureaucrats on all sides, and sometimes, the only way around that was to put it in your hand, carry luggage.    Host: Yeah.  That's true.    Doug Drewry: And, that's just something that, you know, you typically don't do with space hardware.    Host: Now, you're kind of referencing on top of Zarya, all this other stuff that's going on.  Because it is an international space station.  You already said you were working on S1 P1.    Doug Drewry: Sure.    Host: These elements of the truss.  So, how was the space station in the background while Zarya's going through this development from '93 all the way up through launch in '98?  What's going on with the space station during that time?    Doug Drewry: Well, of course, all the space station hardware was progressing.    Host: Yeah.    Doug Drewry: To meet.  We all had launch schedules we were trying to meet, and Bill Bastedo was leading the U.S. node 2A.  All the hardware was progressing.  I occasionally would talk to the people that, the same people that designed the S1 truss and would have done the P1 truss with me or the same people who were working on it when it finally launched for those managers.  So, you know, they were all, everybody was pushing hard to get to where we needed to go.    Host: Yeah.  Definitely.  Now, eventually, you got to launch, right?    Doug Drewry: Yes.    Host: You oversaw a lot of launch as well.    Doug Drewry: I was there for the launch.    Host: Okay.  You were there.    Doug Drewry: Oh, yeah.  Oh, yes.    Host: So, tell me about that.  Tell me about getting ready right before launch day up through the launch itself.    Doug Drewry: We had, well, I mean, we did all the check out of the hardware before it left Moscow.    Host: Okay.    Doug Drewry: The Russians actually transported the hardware up to Baikonur.  And, of course, we had, we'd been in Baikonur five or six times for things prior to launch day as well.  I think we were there for the launch.  We were probably there two or three weeks before the launch.  I don't remember exactly.    Host: Okay.    Doug Drewry: When we showed up, but I mean, we had a lot of final reviews and things to do.    Host: Yeah.    Doug Drewry: On site.  Some of the, again, things that you don't really think about, but we, because this was a joint effort, I had JSC PAO people there.  And, they were out setting up cameras, and they had been allowed to film a couple of the Soyuz launches before that to practice camera placement and stuff.  They managed to fry a few cameras.    Host: All right.  That close.    Doug Drewry: Oh, yeah, yeah.  One of the guys here that was a good friend was, had come back from one of those.  We had met in Baikonur one time, and he said that they'd been out setting up their equipment.  And, one of the sites where they'd set up a camera, they look around suddenly, and all the Russians were gone.  And, they figured they'd better get out of there, and they just barely got out before the rocket went off, and.    Host: No one told them.    Doug Drewry: No one bothered to tell them to move.  So.    Host: Wow.    Doug Drewry: So, it was a, you know, it's a different, it's a different environment.    Host: Definitely.  I've only been to Baikonur once, Karaganda for a landing.  But, you know, me coming in as late as I am in this already existing years and years, decades of experience.    Doug Drewry: Sure.  Sure.    Host: Everything is pretty much, like.    Doug Drewry: It's a process now.    Host: It's a process.  It's routine now.    Doug Drewry: Right.  Right.    Host: But, I'm sure, I mean, how was it going and doing all those things in Baikonur, this strange country, this strange place in Moscow.  Nothing is set for you.  You kind of have to build it from the ground up.    Doug Drewry: We did.  I mean, everything was, like I said, when I first went to Moscow, it was black and white.    Host: Yeah.    Doug Drewry: We were followed.  When we first went to Moscow, we were largely staying at the Penta Hotel.  Probably still stay at the Penta or the Radisson.  We would be escorted to our rooms by a hotel matron, I'll call her.    Host: Okay.    Doug Drewry: And, she would, once we were in our rooms, she'd lock the door.  And, if we wanted to get out of our room, we called the desk, and they would come.  They would escort us around, but we didn't go anywhere by ourselves.    Host: Wow.    Doug Drewry: When we were out on the street, we always had an escort following 50 yards behind us. Following everything we did.  They said it was for our protection, but, you know, who knows.    Host: Sure.    Doug Drewry: In every meeting, pretty much clear to the end, we had a Russian security specialist, one or two guys, standing in the room somewhere who were just monitors.  They never said a word, never did anything.  They just kind of, I guess, made sure people did what they were supposed to do.    Host: Okay.    Doug Drewry: It was, what was really interesting on that, as it turned out, is I flew B52s back in southeast Asia.  And, we were at one of the after parties after one of the big TIMs, technical interchange meetings.  And, one of these Russian security guys was there.  And, we started talking because he was off duty.  And, all of a sudden, this gentleman who had never said a word, he's, of course, he's had some vodka by this point.  But, he's very friendly, and we get to talking.  It turns out he was a young lieutenant in the Russian Rocket Forces in Vietnam at a SAM site about the same time that I was dropping bombs over there.  So, all of a sudden, we were the best friends.  You know.    Host: Wow.    Doug Drewry: From then on, every time he was involved in one of the meetings, he brought me patches.  He brought me this, brought me that.  It, you know, the way we crossed paths was just fascinating.  I mean, there were.    Host: Yeah.    Doug Drewry: A lot of things like that that you don't, you don't appreciate, you know, until you.    Host: Yeah.    Doug Drewry: But, small world after all.    Host: Small world.    Doug Drewry: Yeah definitely.  Host: You in the cockpit, and him behind a SAM.  That's.    Doug Drewry: Yeah, yeah.  Yeah.    Host: Very, yeah.    Doug Drewry: We couldn't verify that we were ever exactly the same spot at the right time.    Host: Right, right.    Doug Drewry: But, we might have been.    Host: And, there you are, working together.  How about that?    Doug Drewry: Yeah.  So.    Host: Let's jump back to launch.  I think we got sidetracked a little bit, but.    Doug Drewry: Sure, sure.    Host: You know.  You said you're there a little bit beforehand getting everything staged three weeks before, I think.  And then, comes right before the launch itself.  This is at the, was this the Baikonur Cosmodrome, then?  Or is this someplace else?    Doug Drewry: No.  It was at Baikonur.    Host: Baikonur.    Doug Drewry: It was.    Host: Okay.    Doug Drewry: Yeah.  It was at Baikonur.  We were there when the FGB came in and was lifted into the vertical and everything.  And, it was a, it was a really unique experience and really pride moment to see.    Host: Yeah.    Doug Drewry: The NASA logo next to the RSA logo on a Russian rocket there.    Host: That's cool.    Doug Drewry: That's the first time it had ever been done.    Host: Right.    Doug Drewry: You asked earlier about other things were going on.  While we were doing the FGB, John McManamen was trying to develop the docking adapter with them.  So, that was off on the side that we ended up using and stuff.  I mean, so there's a lot of other activities going on.    Host: Yeah.    Doug Drewry: As we got close to launch day, of course, we had dignitaries from all over NASA and the U.S. and people showing up and they wanted to be there for the launch.  The actual launch team, both Mark Geyer and Kirk Shireman were there.  I had probably ten of the people from my team plus a couple from Boeing there for the launch.  And, you know, it was fascinating to watch.  It was kind of a cloudy day, so it would have been nice to been a little clearer.  But.    Host: Yeah.    Doug Drewry: Still.  After the launch, we all gathered in a big auditorium, and you had all the agency heads for all the international partners up on the stage.  And, we're sitting in the front row, and it was an interesting thing to see.    Host: Yeah.    Doug Drewry: So.    Host: Were you getting communication from Mission Control in Moscow?    Doug Drewry: Oh, yeah.    Host: That everything was going well?    Doug Drewry: Yep, yep.    Host: I'm sure that was something to set up, too, was actually the mission operations side of things from Houston to Moscow.    Doug Drewry: Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Clearly.    Host: Yeah.    Doug Drewry: I mean, we had quite a few issues.  Like I said, Gerstenmaier was there trying to develop a control center in Moscow or.    Host: Right.    Doug Drewry: A concept, working concept.  John Curry, I think, was, he was a flight director at the time.  He was the one that basically did a lot of the FGB stuff with us, and it was a, you know, we had part of the ongoing discussions where who was going to be in control of this vehicle while it's on orbit.    Host: Yeah.    Doug Drewry: For a year.  And, you know, this is back where some of the Russians thought it should be a Russian only, and some of the U.S. said, \"No.  We're paying for it.  It ought to be us, and we're involved in this, too.  It should be us.\"  So, there were some interesting compromises worked out on some of that stuff.    Host: Okay.  Well, in the end, what ended up happening?  Was, who was monitoring it throughout the next few years?    Doug Drewry: Both.    Host: There you go.  [laughter]    Doug Drewry: Both.  We had a U.S. control center and a Russian control center.  And, we had people there, and I'm sure they had somebody here.  I was.    Host: Yeah.    Doug Drewry: I know I was back here for the 2A launch and, or in KSC and then back here immediately afterward for the docking.    Host: Okay.    Doug Drewry: And then, and, I'm pretty sure there was a Russian representative for two here, so.    Host: Okay.    Doug Drewry: There was, it was quite an achievement.  I think everybody was really, you know, speechless.    Host: Yeah.    Doug Drewry: Probably the word I'd use.    Host: Yeah, so this was a big project for you.  You were the program manager for quite some time, and then, after FGB and, you know, you went through all this negotiation and reworks and how was this going to be framed for the future.  What you do at NASA after that?    Doug Drewry: Well, kind of interesting.  I went through that early negotiation through getting the contract resolved in Moscow and the initial direction.  And then, I was planning on going back to shuttle.  I'd done EVA stuff with shuttle before, and I was asked to stay on.  And, I said, \"Well, the only way I would stay on is if you give me the first flight or something else.\"  And, my theory was I'd been in space station for so long.    Host: Right.    Doug Drewry: And, we'd been through so many redesigns.  I figure the first flight had the best chance of completing.    Host: All right.    Doug Drewry: Eventually.  So.    Host: Yeah.    Doug Drewry: And, Doug Cook is the one who talked me into staying.  Said, \"Okay.  You got the first flight.\"    Host: Okay.    Doug Drewry: Several times during the five years it took us to build, I was actually turned down promotion of the Russian.  I would have taken the Russian segment, and I turned it down.  There was just too many, I felt there, for two reasons.  There was too many things going on, too many things that were unusual about the FGB that we had done.  Again, rewriting FARs, fighting with budget people outside of the agency, GAO and things.  Not to mention all the technical things we had going on.  And, plus, I felt I was in a unique position from beginning to end.  I really wanted to see this thing launched.    Host: Yes.    Doug Drewry: So, I stayed to the very end.  After that, I was talked into starting the external carrier's office and space station.  We built a bay 13 carrier.  We built quite a few pieces of external storage platforms and things and figured out how we were going to launch spares to orbit for the station.  After that, I went over to the structures division as a deputy division chief and ended up being there through all the Colombia stuff.  Basically, my boss was off on a contract negotiation.  So, I ended up acting chief for a couple of years then went to staff in engineering.  And, after post Colombia and worked on the repair kits and things we were going to do there and ultimately ended up back in shuttle.    Host: Oh.    Doug Drewry: And, so, you know, I was at the launch for all the last flights and running the Debris Integration Team.  And, I can happily say I was on the runway when the last flight landed.  So.    Host: All right.    Doug Drewry: Literally, I was on the runway, so.    Host: Wow.    Doug Drewry: So, it was a, it was a fun career.    Host: Yeah.  For sure.  What's interesting about, especially the beginning of your career is you were, I mean, you're saying recognizable people to me.  You know, I work with Shireman.    Doug Drewry: Everybody's done well.    Host: Yeah.  Everyone's doing well.  But.    Doug Drewry: They're good friends.    Host: You're a manager at this point, and this, throughout your career, managing and leading products.  Tell me about what it took to be successful at that and despite all of these back and forths to manage a team and to execute the mission throughout the launch and beyond.    Doug Drewry: I would say two things.  One is that you can't be the, you might be the smartest guy in the room, but you're not the smartest guy in the room.  And, no matter what you know, you don't know everything.  So, my first philosophy is to always surround myself with the smartest people I can find.    Host: Yeah.    Doug Drewry: And, that's where the subsystem people, subsystem managers, those were the real technical experts on their systems.  I knew enough to be dangerous, and I could settle arguments and give direction after hearing the facts.  You know, but, they were still the experts.    Host: Yeah.    Doug Drewry: And, you really need people that understand things and do those.  As well as you need somebody to do the integration.    Host: Yeah.    Doug Drewry: The other thing is that I felt a big part of my job was to, as a NASA person and a NASA manager on a program like that or a project like that is to always try to get the best value for the American people.  You know, the tax dollars.  So, I felt it was important to just as if you were building a house or anything else, you'd want to, you want a good product, then you want a fair price on it.  So.    Host: Yeah.  So, it's really about, you know, understanding what you need to do, understanding who is the best at doing it, and establishing good communications channels but never letting go of that perspective of why you're doing it.    Doug Drewry: Well, yeah, you have to, you have to know where you're trying to go.  You know, the hardest thing is to ask, find out what's the right question.  Once you know the question, you can set about figuring out what the answer's going to be.    Host: Yeah.    Doug Drewry: And, you can’t become so rigid that just like in this building hardware, you know, the Viewgraph engineering I mentioned on the front end.  You look at these projects on the front end, and it all looks great.  It looks like it's nice and linear and things are going to work great.  Well, that rarely works out, especially when you're doing things that haven't been done before or that, in the case of a lot of the space station hardware, you're talking about building with materials that don't exist yet.  You have a design goal you're trying to do something, but, and you know what you want to do, but you can't just go off the shelf and put it together.  You've got to develop the materials along the way so that you can do what you're trying to do.  And.    Host: Yeah.    Doug Drewry: And, when you're doing things like that, there's always problems.  There's always issues, and some, you've got to be ready to, you never throw away where you're trying to go, but you may change a path to get there.    Host: Yeah.    Doug Drewry: If there's a better path.  And, you've got to be open to see that.    Host: Yeah.  That's true.  You're doing new things all the time and recognizing that is part of the learning process.    Doug Drewry: Sure.  Sure.    Host: So, you know, you talked about your career going forward, even seeing being on the runway for the last landing.  That was pretty cool.  But, you know, you oversaw this first part, this first step in the International Space Station.  And, you know, I'm working, right now, pretty closely with what it is today.    Doug Drewry: Sure.    Host: A functioning laboratory in space.    Doug Drewry: Sure.    Host: Constant habitation.  Constant, hundreds of experiments per rotation.  As a well functioning laboratory, and that's what I know.  But, you know, looking at the program from your perspective from the beginning, did you anticipate that this is where it was going to go?  Did it exceed your expectations?  Was it different from your expectations?  Looking at it now.    Doug Drewry: It depends on the timeframe.    Host: Okay.  Okay.    Doug Drewry: And, I say that with some hesitancy because when I first came into space station, there was a separate assembly node.  I mean, part of the studies we were doing, there was going to be, the space station was being designed to support on orbit assembly of, and this was in the design phase, but on orbit assembly of lunar transfer vehicles and Mars return vehicles.  So, the thing that's always plagued us is that getting from the ground to low earth orbit is so costly.  I mean, it's such an effort, and so much energy is expended.  That, if you can, and, of course, the bigger piece you make on the ground, the more technical difficulties, technically difficult as well as expensive it is to get up to orbit.  So, if you can bring up smaller pieces and assemble them on orbit, then once you're free of the atmosphere, you can, you can go almost anywhere, do almost anything.    Host: Right.    Doug Drewry: So, the original space station concept had this maintenance hanger out to the side, if you would.  So that, you could, these lunar vehicles would come back and you would do engine change outs and things there.  And then, there would be another vehicle that would return whatever payload or cargo to the earth.  And, the transfer vehicle would go back to the moon and do whatever it's going to do there.  So, in some respects, it's disappointing that we scrubbed all of that stuff out.  I mean, I understand the realities and the difficulties of getting there and that, you know, this is all so difficult that it's a stepping stone.  And, again, when you had to develop things to do what you're trying to do, you can't just, you can't just go buy it somewhere.  You have to make it happen.    Host: Yeah.    Doug Drewry: And, but at the same time, we were always planning the core station to be a laboratory.  And so, it doesn't surprise me where we are on that.  It's what we built it for.    Host: Right.    Doug Drewry: And, I think it fulfills that role very well.  You know, I think someday, we'll go back, we'll expand to those other things still.  It's just you got to take it one step at a time.    Host: Yeah.  Now.  Seeing just how, just the FGB and going through all the changes from the beginning, the inception of the program through all the changes, and then, finally launching.  That kind of can translate, right, to the whole International Space Station?  Just it did get together, but just it might take some time.  You know, it's still.    Doug Drewry: Sure.  Sure.    Host: Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.    Doug Drewry: Sure.  I probably get one or two, well, it's not as often now.  I probably get, still get one call a year somebody wanting to know something about the FGB.    Host: Oh, really?    Doug Drewry: Because I've still got all this data that probably no one else has.    Host: Oh, okay.    Doug Drewry: But, no, it was, like I said, it was, in the beginning, it was kind of the keystone element.  It's still a core part of the station.  It's probably, I'm sure the crews these days look at it as a storage module, place to shove things because there's not really crew accommodations in there, per se, unless you want to hang out in the docking node and hide from everybody for a little while.  But, it's not where you really live and, like you do on the rest of the station or do experiments.  It's largely storage.  But, at the same time, though, it is still the module that's passing all that data back and forth and making those fluid connections and everything else from one end of the station to the other.  So, it's.    Host: Yeah.    Doug Drewry: Still a core piece of the space station.    Host: Yeah.    Doug Drewry: And, in doing what it was, what it was intended to do.    Host: Yeah.    Doug Drewry: Trying to integrate, basically, a U.S. design where we were with Freedom and then Alpha, with the Russian design where they were with Mir.  And, the service module's largely an offshoot of that.  And, their concepts are still largely the same.  There had to be something in the middle to bring that all together, and that's what the job of the FGB was to do.  So.    Host: Looking at you starting, you know, the FGB, Zarya, and then, towards the end, moving on to the next program.  Before you did that, what do you think was some of your biggest, if not just the single biggest takeaways from the experience of your time as the program manager for FGB?    Doug Drewry: How amazing the NASA people are.    Host: Okay.    Doug Drewry: How similar some of our international partners are, yet different.    Host: Yeah.    Doug Drewry: You know, different, but how well people can work together when they really have incentive to do so.    Host: Right.    Doug Drewry: You know, but, yeah, the NASA people are just unparalleled, I think, in my mind they're just fantastic people, and are capable of great things.    Host: Yeah.    Doug Drewry: You know.    Host: Definitely.  I want to kind of end on this note, and it's an international space station, and you worked internationally.  And, you know, there were some ups and downs to it.    Doug Drewry: Oh, sure.    Host: There was challenges, especially going in.  I mean, and I respect you for this is going in just, you know, you said you knew the day before.  Here you go.  You're going to Russia.  Make this work.  But, you know, based on understanding, even through the challenges of working with different culture, what is the benefit of international collaboration?    Doug Drewry: There's a lot of, I mean, on multiple fronts.  Both just from getting to know other people around the world to, from the technical side.  I mean, we, you know, my going in impression of the Russians, or the way I would still summarize it, for example, would be that we spend years and years developing a lighter weight material and refining a design.  And, it takes us forever to get something launched.    Host: Yeah.    Doug Drewry: Whereas, the Russian approach was we'll strap on another booster and launch a, you know, build it out of iron.  And, well, that's true in some respects, people don't realize that in some cases, on the ISS today, Russian mandated requirements are more stringent than NASA's requirements are in some areas.  For example, we had a, there was a long discussion over many months or years about water quality because their standards for their crews and what they wanted were more stringent than what our standards were.  And, ours are pretty stringent, as you can imagine.  So, you know, it, another example would be having worked on the MB3 stuff.  I had an ICD with shuttle that we were ready to, we were actually working our integration with shuttle for the MB3 launch for space station Freedom.  Sitting through all those meetings with the orbiter people were kind of fascinating.  I'd watch other payloads on the same flight, some of these universities and things that were trying to fly things.  And, they would come in and, with their design, and I'd watch the orbiter people tell them “That's not good enough.  Go home, and, you know, come back another day.”    Host: Wow.    Doug Drewry: And, we're talking months in some cases.  One of those early meetings with the Russians.  Of course, we had our people with us, and someone didn't like something about the way the Russians were proposing to do something.  And, they said, \"Well, this is the way we do it at shuttle.\"  And, the Russians responded right back, \"Well, we've been flying for 30 years, and we think that's stupid.\"    Doug Drewry: Oh.    Host: So, it kind of forced us to go back and look at some of the things that we had traditionally done.    Host: Yeah.  Take a look at yourself.  Doug Drewry: And, some of our processes and things and.    Host: Yeah.    Doug Drewry: And, you end up taking the best of both worlds, I think, is what you're really shooting for.  And, I think the product of our collaboration is better than it would have been with either of us trying to do it individually.    Host: Yeah.    Doug Drewry: You know.    Host: Different perspective and maybe a little bit of humility.    Doug Drewry: Oh, most definitely.  I mean, again, you're not the smartest guy in the room necessarily.  You know.  You may go in thinking you are, but if you leave that way, something's wrong.    Host: Yeah.  Well, Doug, this has been a fascinating conversation and definitely an interesting perspective.  It's nothing that, you know, I did a decent amount of research to try to put this together, but this is, this was fascinating.  So, I really appreciate you coming in and coming on today.    Doug Drewry: Glad to help.  Any time.    [ Music ]    Host: Hey, thanks for sticking around.  So, it was a very interesting conversation with Doug Drewry.  He gave us a nice perspective of that first launch that started the whole thing, the International Space Station, just 20 years ago.  So, if you want to listen to more podcasts of everything going around NASA, we have Rocket Ranch, NASA in Silicon Valley, Gravity Assist hosted by Dr. Jim Green up at NASA's headquarters.  We're talking about the International Space Station now.  It's the 20th anniversary, but we're going to have launches and landings of astronauts and cosmonauts coming here soon to continue to live and work aboard the International Space Station.  So, go to nasa.gov/ntv to find the scheduled on when that's happening.  Otherwise, you can follow all the happenings of the space station on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram where the International Space Station on all those accounts.  Use the hashtag #AskNASA on your favorite platform to submit an idea.  Make sure to mention it's for Houston, We Have a Podcast.  We'll bring it right on the show.  This episode was recorded on October 9, 2018.  Thanks to Alex Perryman, Pat Ryan, Norah Moran, and Kelly Humphries.  Thanks again to Mr. Doug Drewry for taking the time to come on the show.   Stay tuned for part two of our ISS beginnings episode with Mr. Jerry Ross to discuss the mission that followed Zarya, STS88 and attached the Unity module to Zarya and the astronauts and cosmonauts entered the International Space Station in low earth orbit for the first time.  We'll be back with that episode next week."

                        "description": "Gary Jordan (Host): Houston, we have a podcast.  Welcome to the official podcast of the NASA Johnson Space Center, episode 75, Radiation Shielding.  I'm Gary Jordan and I'll be your host today.  On this podcast, we bring in the experts, NASA scientists, engineers, and astronauts all to let you know the coolest information about what's going on right here at NASA.  So, if you're familiar with us, you may have heard us talk about radiation before.  We've talked about the effects on living organisms from Dr. Zarana Patel on Episode 57.  And we've had Dr. Steve Johnson tell us more about the physics and the day to day operations on the space station dealing with radiation and space weather on Episode 64.  But today we're learning once again about Orion and how the spacecraft is built to withstand the radiation environment of deep space from Matt Lemke.  He's the Orion avionics, power and software deputy manager here at the Johnson Space Center.  He understands how Orion is radiation-hardened so the systems inside can withstand the harsh environment of space.  The key word here is redundancy.  So, with no further delay, let's jump right ahead to our talk with Mr. Matt Lemke.   Enjoy.    [ Music ]    Host: Matt, thank you so much for coming on the podcast today to talk about radiation shielding on Orion, the deep space spacecraft that we have here.    Matt Lemke: Yeah, it's a pleasure to be here.    Host: All right.  So, we've talked about radiation in general before on the podcast.  We've talked about how it affects the human body, we've talked about the physics of it, space weather, why we have to be concerned about it in the first place, but not specifically how it affects spacecraft.  And this is an interesting one because Orion is going to go deeper into space and it's going to pass through the Van Allen radiation belt and there's a lot of concerns when it comes to traveling in deep space, specifically when it comes to radiation.  So, why don't we just kind of start off there.  Radiation.  What is it?  Why do we have to be concerned about it?    Matt Lemke: OK.  So, the radiation comes from the sun.    Host: OK.    Matt Lemke: And so you've probably heard that in your space physics lecture and they probably did a better job than I will, but you've got a couple different sources of it.  Different types of radiation.  So, you have this Van Allen belt you mentioned and we have a magnetic field around the Earth.  And that traps a lot of protons and, you know, that size of particle, and that's what we've been used to dealing with for so many years.  Space station, space shuttle, we got really good about how to work in the proton environment that's there, so there's real good ways to test for it, see what our equipment's going to do, make sure we can recover.  But now as we go out beyond and through the Van Allen belt and into deep space, we have to start worrying about solar flares and galactic cosmic rays and these things that have a lot more energy and can come into the electronics and corrupt them.  And so that's what we're really worried about versus the effects to the human is, what's the effect to the computer?    Host: Yeah.    Matt Lemke: And so a radiation, a proton, a galactic cosmic ray, something like that can come in and it'll change a 1 to a 0 in your electronics.  So, your computer thought, hey, I was working along, I'm doing my instructions one at a time, executing my software, and suddenly the data is wrong or the software program has been corrupted by changing a 0 to a 1 or vice versa.  And so we have to build systems that can handle that.    Host: OK.    Matt Lemke: You know it's going to happen, radiation's out there.  It's statistical whether or not you get hit, and so we designed systems that can tolerate those bit flips.    Host: Yeah.  So, I mean just besides the human element, now we're talking about-- radiation, when it comes to being concerned about what radiation is going to do to a spacecraft, corrupting how it works, that's really the concern.    Matt Lemke: Right. That's the concern.    Host: And that's a big concern.    Matt Lemke: Right.  And so, on Orion, if you think about it, the computers control almost everything.    Host: Yeah.    Matt Lemke: The life support system, the communications, the propulsion system, navigation, so everything is controlled by the computer and so when the computer malfunctions you have a problem.  And actually sometimes it's good when it really malfunctions bad, because then you know you have it, right?  You have your Windows machine and you get the blue screen of death.  Well, at least you know something happened and you can reboot it and do something.    Host: OK.    Matt Lemke: So, that's one type of error we can have.  The other type of error is it just corrupts the data.  So, you thought you were getting, you know, readout coms and it says it's 15 whatever units and that's a wrong number now because a bit got flipped.  So, it can mislead you and it can just corrupt it and make it stop working.    Host: Huh.  So, when it comes to understanding these problems and knowing kind of-- trying to understand what you have to do to fix it, my first thought comes for detecting it.  How do you know that you have a wrong number?  How do you know that the data that you're getting is in fact wrong and has been affected by radiation?    Matt Lemke: Right.  That's step one.  And so we have a flight computer.    Host: OK.    Matt Lemke: And-- we actually have four flight computers and we can get into why we have four because it's due to radiation, but even within one flight computer, it's really two microprocessors running together.  And so each microprocessor is executing the same code and then it compares its outputs and they should be identical.  So, one nice thing about radiation is it's not like vibration that affects the whole spacecraft at once.  It's a, you know, very miniscule particle or wave-- I'm not even sure what the right physics term is-- but it comes through and it only hits one thing, right, it's going to hit one piece of silicon, one transistor at a time, and mess it up.  And so the chances of the same piece of radiation going through both of these processors at the same time and corrupting the same bit so that when the two processors compare their answers that they're identical, that's just really-- we call that inconsequential.  It's not going to happen.    Host: OK.    Matt Lemke: So, if one of them gets an upset, the other one doesn't, it compares its answer, and then we do what we call fail silent.  We get a miscompare and we say something's wrong, fail silent, I'm not going to do anything more.  And then you depend on the other computers to take over for you.  Now, when that happens, you can reset that computer and get going again.    Host: OK.    Matt Lemke: And so that's a key to us is being able to reset the computer and go again.  So, when radiation affects electronics, you can have a few different effects.  One is it just sort of degrades performance a little bit.  It doesn't change a one to a zero, but over time-- so, if you're doing a long, you know, 10-year mission to Jupiter with heavy radiation, your parts may degrade and fail.  We're not really worried about on that Orion.  We're worried about those bit flips.  And when the bit flips, it can be a-- just a momentary error, it flips, and then it comes back and it's correct, or it can be permanent.  Like I burned out that transistor and it's never going to work again.  And so that's how we do our radiation testing is to make sure that the failure modes in the electronics we fly are those that can be reset by a power cycle.  If it's going to burn something up, we reject that piece of hardware and we look for a different implementation so we don't have those problems.  So, everything we're talking about is something you can fix with a power cycle, worst case.    Host: Wow.  So, to defend against radiation, you won't put a system on Orion that has the potential to burn out due to radiation.    Matt Lemke: Right.    Host: Wow.    Matt Lemke: Or at least we won't put it on Orion in a flight-critical location.  Right?    Host: OK.  You've got to be selective.    Matt Lemke: Our flight computer, our propulsion system, our life support system.  We're going to fly some laptops for crew use.    Host: OK.    Matt Lemke: Email, videoconferencing, that sort of thing.  Those might burn up and we'll just accept that risk, but not on our flight computer.  Not on the critical hardware that's going to fly the spacecraft.    Host: Yeah.  That's where you need those redundancies, the computers checking computers and then back up computers to check those computers.    Matt Lemke: Right.    Host: OK.  I see that.    Matt Lemke: And that's actually why we have four computers.  We looked at the environment in space.  We looked at solar flares, solar particle events, we looked at the Van Allen belt.  We looked at how much radiation there is and we predict what our upset rate is.  To buy electronics that doesn't upset, you know, that's designed for radiation, extremely expensive.    Host: Yeah.    Matt Lemke: Right?  If we built our spacecraft that way, it would be using technology that was very old, it wouldn't be very capable.  So, we have to find that right balance between how often it upsets, how bad it upsets, and what we can afford.  So, our flight computers, when we predict it, worst case, there's a one in three chance during a mission that a flight computer can mess up.  So, that's a pretty high--    Host: That's significant.    Matt Lemke: That's significant.    Host: Yeah.    Matt Lemke: Right.  So, if-- what happens if that happens?    Host: OK.    Matt Lemke: It upsets.  It takes about 22 seconds to reboot and be going again.  OK?  So, one in three chance that a computer will fail and takes 22 seconds to recover.  So, we have a backup computer.  We put a second one on.  And then you look at what is the chances of both of those computers getting an independent radiation hit during the same 22-second window.  Right?  Because if one goes down but the other one's flying, you're good.  The problem is if both of them go down.    Host: Right.    Matt Lemke: So, we looked at that and the chances were one in 89 that both could in the worst-case radiation environment, one in 89 it could go down.  We said that's still not good enough.  So, we had three computers.  We said that wasn't quite good enough.  We had four computers and you say there's a one in a 150,000 chance that all four could go down in the same 22-second window.  We finally said, OK, that's how many flight computers we're going to fly.    Host: OK.    Matt Lemke: And that's, once again, worst-case.    Host: Yeah.    Matt Lemke: What we really expect is that to be more like one in a million missions that could really happen.    Host: Right.  Still, I mean-- wow, that's-- that's a big buffer. [laughter]  I'm trying-- I mean-- but the logic that you said is critical, though.  It's-- these are-- that's the-- this is the thing that's flying you, you know?  You don't want that thing to go down.  So, it comes to-- it sounds like it's a team coming together and assessing what they're comfortable with and the comfort level considering cost, considering redundancy, it came down to four.    Matt Lemke: It came down to four.    Host: OK.    Matt Lemke: And then that still wasn't good enough--    Host: What?  Really?    Matt Lemke: So, we have a backup flight system.  So, those first four computers are all doing the exact same software, flying the vehicle, and then you worry in addition to radiation, what if you had a common-cause software failure?  So, there was a bug in your code that you didn't catch in ground testing that could cause all four to go down at once.  We have a whole other computer that does backup flight software.  So, written separately, wouldn't have those same flaws.    Host: Huh.    Matt Lemke: So, we really have those four plus another one in the case of a radiation event to keep us safe.    Host: Wow.  OK.  Yeah, I think I would feel pretty safe flying on that thing.    Matt Lemke: And that's the key.  And what we use is-- like you say, we balance all those different parameters and radiation is just one parameter we worry about, right?  So, we manage the whole spacecraft based on a loss of crew probability.  We have a requirement that says we want one in 240 missions is our chance of actually losing the crew due to something we know about, whether it be the parachutes going out, radiation hitting the vehicle, whatever.  So, when we accumulate all that risk, we want to minimize that loss of crew probability.  And that's what we use to drive where we put our money and where we put our effort onto the vehicle.    Host: OK.    Matt Lemke: And, fortunately, radiation is something we can do something about, right?  We can add redundancy.    Host: Right.    Matt Lemke: We can do all of that.  And so right now radiation is not one of those top program drivers to the risk of losing a crew.    Host: Huh.    Matt Lemke: Because we could-- there's something we can do about it.    Host: Yeah.    Matt Lemke: You know, a heat shield, you have one.    Host: Right.    Matt Lemke: The parachutes, you have many, but three main ones.    Host: Yeah.    Matt Lemke: And you could lose one of those and still land safely.    Host: Right.    Matt Lemke: But you can't lose two.  So, some of those things, we want to be the ones that drive-- the things we can't do anything about, we want them to drive our risk, not things we can do something about.    Host: Yeah.  Because you have these redundancies because you honestly don't know when radiation is going to hit exactly that computer and which one and how many.    Matt Lemke: Right.    Host: Wow.  OK.  So, that's-- when it comes to radiation shielding, the way that you are shielding the spacecraft is through redundancy.  That's really--    Matt Lemke: I've never thought of it that way before.  That's not what shielding means, but that's how we handle the probability of the radiation happening is through redundancy.  Shielding is very difficult.    Host: Yeah.    Matt Lemke: Right?    Host: Yeah.    Matt Lemke: Space station has, you know, a certain amount of aluminum on it.  Orion has, you know, aluminum, titanium, some back shells.  But these particles are so energetic, they're just going to go through.  So, we don't get a lot of physical shielding from anything like that.  You know, if you had a space craft that was surrounded by a foot of water, like a water bladder, that would really help reduce your radiation risk.    Host: Yeah.    Matt Lemke: Kind of heavy and not very practical.    Host: Right.  Yeah.  That's a lot of water.    Matt Lemke: Right.  So, basically we do do what you said is we make sure our redundancy is there in order to accomplish a mission safely.    Host: So, that's-- when it comes to radiation, you know, we're talking a lot about software and the computers that are controlling.  What else can radiation affect on Orion?  What else can it affect-- can it-- can it blast through some of the materials themselves?  Can it-- can it burn out wires?  Can it affect the power source?  Can it do any of that?    Matt Lemke: Yeah, radiation can affect anything, but remember these are extremely small particles, so it's not like a bullet blasting through something.  It's at the atomic level.    Host: Right.    Matt Lemke: And so it really doesn't affect a piece of wire.    Host: Yeah.    Matt Lemke: Right?  So--    Host: So, even if it does, this is not something that you need to worry about when you're designing a spacecraft.    Matt Lemke: Right.  We don't worry about that piece of it.    Host: Yeah.    Matt Lemke: That's where you get into some of the more long-term effects of radiation of-- a board just slowly degrades.  Right?  So, it hits this molecule and throws it out of the-- how it's supposed to operate.  Then it hits another one and eventually your transistors just start not working right.  So, they're-- that's the time duration aspect to radiation.    Host: OK.    Matt Lemke: Which on, you know, this particular mission we don't have to worry about.    Host: Yeah.    Matt Lemke: You know, a Mars vehicle, something that's going to be out there maybe for a couple years, we'll have to start worrying about what we call total dose effects.    Host: Right.  Yeah.  You'll have to watch those computers pretty carefully, right?    Matt Lemke: Watch those computers-- and really it's not even just computers, that's what we've emphasized so far--    Host: Sure.    Matt Lemke: But your radio.    Host: Oh, yeah.    Matt Lemke: It's really a computer these days, right?  That's all digital.  Your displays are digital.  The life support, the, you know, the controllers for the pumps and the fans.  Those are all digital.  So, all of those also have the opportunity to be affected.    Host: Huh.  OK.  I'm thinking about testing.  You know?  You're talking about-- you're thinking what could happen, you have these redundancies.  Do you have some sort of-- I'm imagining a radiation room where you put the computers in and you start blasting away and let's see what happens and let's see if the computers can still run with all this radiation happening?    Matt Lemke: Right.  So, the best way to do that is to put it in space and test it.    Host: There you go.    Matt Lemke: Because you need these very, very energetic particles.  So, we try and do the best we can on Earth.  We go to things like Texas A&M University has a cyclotron where it can shoot heavy ions at you and you can control which heavy ions it shoots and how many it shoots per unit time.  But they don't have the same energy as what you can get from the sun.    Host: Yeah.    Matt Lemke: And so, they don't have the ability to penetrate like all the way through your computer and the beams are very small.  So, it's not possible to take your whole flight computer and put it in a radiation chamber or a radiation beam and get a test all at once.  We have to go to space for that.  What we can do is test each individual component.  So, we can test the processor chip and the memory chip.  We take the lids off, we expose the inner silicon to the radiation beam, and then we-- we're running test software that looks for errors.    Host: OK.    Matt Lemke: Right?  And so that's how we know if a part burns up.  Right?  We put it in the radiation beam and it stops working forever and a power cycle doesn't fix it.  We know this is not a part we want to fly.    Host: Yep.  Don't use that one.    Matt Lemke: We put it in a beam and it does nothing but upset constantly, also not good.    Host: Right.    Matt Lemke: So, we find the right mix between what parts are available, how often they upset.  And then our radiation physics people take the cross-section of the beam, the cross-section of the part, how often it upsets, and they give us an on-orbit prediction for what's going to happen.    Host: OK.  So, I guess really what you're looking forward to now is EM-1, the first flight of the Orion out towards the moon, around the moon, right?  That's where it's really going to hit some of that-- those high energy radiation that you're talking about.    Matt Lemke: Right.  When we flew EFT-1, the flight test--    Host: Yeah.    Matt Lemke: We actually went up 3000 miles, so we went out through the Van Allen radiation belts and back in.  So, that was a good first test.    Host: How'd it do?    Matt Lemke: Of how we did in radiation-- and we did very well.    Host: OK.    Matt Lemke: That was a very short mission, you know, three and a half, four hours long.    Host: Yeah.    Matt Lemke: But it did get up through the belts.  We didn't have upsets, we didn't see that, but that's more of a statistical thing, right?  It could have happened, could have happened multiple times, and we would have said our models are still good.  So, now we start talking about a mission to the moon.    Host: Yeah.    Matt Lemke: You know, 14 to 40 days, that sort of duration, and your chances go up.    Host: Right.    Matt Lemke: Of having these events happen.    Host: OK.  So, that's-- yeah, that will reveal a lot on how these-- this avionic software is.    Matt Lemke: Right.    Host: Can we-- when I'm thinking about a spacecraft, you know, we're talking about it going to the moon, right?  I'm imagining-- especially when it comes to software and processing capability, we've come a long way in that field when it comes to the last time we took a human-rated vehicle to the moon and that was the Apollo capsule, right?    Matt Lemke: Right.    Host: What are some of the differences there?    Matt Lemke: It's really about computer control of the vehicle.    Host: OK.    Matt Lemke: So, when Apollo went, things like the life support system were not computer controlled.  Those were all-- we call them analog controls.  They were just, you know, thermostats and different kinds of electronics to control each individual subsystem.  The difficulty with that is when you find a problem, you want it to operate differently.  There's no easy way to fix it.  Right?  You have to redesign the hardware, rebuilt it, retest it.  So, there's a big advantage to making the spacecraft lighter, more capable, easier to change, and easier to maintain, so let the computers run everything.  And now when you find a flaw, all you have to do is change a few lines of code-- and I say all you have to do-- you've got to test it, you've got to make sure it works.    Host: Sure.    Matt Lemke: But you can do it without affecting the hardware and you can do it on a much more efficient schedule.    Host: OK.  Yeah.  So, we've definitely come a long way in that--    Matt Lemke: We've come a long way and it then gives you flexibility for how you want to operate your spacecraft too.  Right?  So, now you can do things you never were able to do before.  You can go anywhere.  You know, Orion's going to be able to go anywhere around the moon and land back anywhere on Earth, versus Apollo had a very tight corridor of where it could go.  So, we have a lot more capability, a lot more changes we can make.    Host: Yeah.  Wow.  One of the things I'm thinking of is-- thinking about the Apollo missions is how short they were.  You know?  You're only talking about a couple days.  But now with Orion, after the first couple test missions, EM-1, EM-2, we're talking about a gateway around the moon.  We're talking about long duration stay and sustainability around the moon.  That requires length of time and that was one of the things you touched on.  So, how do these tests for radiation and redundancies test out over time?  Is that something that we still need to discover?    Matt Lemke: We include that in all our calculations.  Right?  So, the longer you go, if I tell you there's a one in 10 chance of getting an upset today--    Host: Yeah.    Matt Lemke: And tomorrow and the next day, as you add up the days, your probability goes up that something will happen.    Host: OK.    Matt Lemke: And so the duration-- since we're not worried about total ionizing dose effects, we're not going to be there that long, it's just a matter of it's more and more likely you're going to see events the longer you're there.    Host: Of course.    Matt Lemke: Right?  And the other risk you take is solar flares.  Right?  They're infrequent.  When they go, they may not come and get you, they may go some different direction.  We have some prediction capability on solar flares and some warning.  So, you know, you wouldn't launch a spacecraft knowing a solar flare was on the way.    Host: Yeah.    Matt Lemke: But you start extending the length of the mission and you start increasing your chance of getting a solar flare while you're there.    Host: Huh.    Matt Lemke: And so, you know, that's part of our driving case.  That's what makes our worst-case radiation prediction is we're depending on a twice the worst-case solar flare we've ever recorded.  So, back in 1989 there was one, they recorded its magnitude, it's the biggest we've seen.  We say, well, what happens if it's twice as big?  That's what we're designing for.    Host: Wow.    Matt Lemke: Now, we don't want one of those to hit.    Host: No.    Matt Lemke: And from your-- when you were talking about the effects on humans, you don't want that to hit.    Host: Definitely not.    Matt Lemke: Right?  So, there is a place inside Orion, I don't know if you talked about it before, but it's the most-shielded place.  Even though the aluminum doesn't do a lot, the crew can get into the most shielded place.  And while they're stuck in there, you'd like your computers to keep working.    Host: Oh, of course.  Of course.    Matt Lemke: Right?    Host: Yeah, because even if they do survive, you don't want-- you still want to be able to fly home.    Matt Lemke: That's exactly right.    Host: Very, very important.  Now, we're talking about these redundancies, we're talking about being out in the moon for longer periods of time and being able to deal with that over time.  I'm thinking about just besides the technical component, the computer component, just sustaining the vehicle-- the power.  Is that something we have to be concerned about with radiation?  Or, actually, why don't we just back up even further, how does that even work?    Matt Lemke: So, we have batteries.    Host: OK.    Matt Lemke: Right?  Keep our spacecraft going all the way from prelaunch, you know, from the time when we lose ground power all the way until we get on orbit and we can unfurl solar arrays.  So, there's four solar arrays on the surface module of the Orion.  So, I don't know if you're familiar with the Orion capsule, but it's got a crew module, which is a place where the crew stays the entire mission.    Host: OK.    Matt Lemke: Then we have a service module below it that contains our power, our extra oxygen, water, fuel, propulsion systems.    Host: OK.    Matt Lemke: That keep the vehicle going throughout the mission.    Host: Yeah.    Matt Lemke: And then we jettison that service module right before reentry.    Host: Yeah.    Matt Lemke: And then just the crew module comes home.    Host: OK.    Matt Lemke: And that service module we call the European service module because it's being built by ESA and their prime contractor Airbus over in Europe.  So, it's an international program.    Host: Yeah.    Matt Lemke: Part of that service module is four solar array wings.    Host: OK.    Matt Lemke: So, these are four rectangular wings that unfold once we get on orbit, about 19 meters in diameter, so they unfurl, they're pretty big; 15,000 solar cells, individual solar cells on there, and they generate all the power for the spacecraft.    Host: Nice.    Matt Lemke: And so as long as we're in a place where the solar arrays are out and we have access to the sun-- like we're not behind the moon-- we're generating power and keeping our batteries topped off.    Host: OK.    Matt Lemke: Now, when we go behind the moon or we're in a shadow, then our batteries take over.  And then, of course, when the batteries-- when we jettison the service module to come home, now we're on battery power as well.    Host: Yeah.    Matt Lemke: So, those batteries have to be big enough to get us back down through the atmosphere and land in the water and then keep the crew safe for up to 24 hours after they're in the water.    Host: OK.  Does this-- I'm trying to-- I remember seeing an animation about the EM-1 and I think there was-- there was one more stage of the SLS, I think, itself that got-- that did the translunar injection.  And then once it was on the way to the moon, that's when the solar arrays came out.  Is that right?  Is that how--    Matt Lemke: We actually put them out ahead of time.    Host: Oh, you do?    Matt Lemke: So, we want to check out our spacecraft and make sure it's good and healthy before we do that burn to go to the moon.    Host: Oh, that makes sense.    Matt Lemke: Right?  And then of course if for some reason the solar arrays can't come out, if the mechanism doesn't work, they don't unfurl right, if there's some problem, we need to still have enough battery power to do an abort even though we're in space and get back down while we still have battery power.    Host: OK.  So, while you're still within the vicinity of the Earth, you're checking out a lot of these systems because once that translunar injection burn goes, you want to make sure everything's working.    Matt Lemke: You want to make sure it's working.  And then you have to be careful.  Now you've put these big wings out and you're going to fire a big rocket from SLS, we call it the ICPS, interim cryogenic propulsion stage-- I think I got that right.    Host: All right.    Matt Lemke: But that's a lot of thrust and a lot of force on the spacecraft.  So, we have to put the solar arrays in a safe altitude so that the forces of the rocket engine firing don't break them.    Host: OK.  Is there redundant systems there for power to make sure that we have enough to go in case something were to happen?    Matt Lemke: Yeah.  So, the whole vehicle has to be at least one failure tolerant.    Host: OK.    Matt Lemke: Right?  So, we have four batteries on our vehicle.    Host: Four.  All right.    Matt Lemke: Right, but what if one of them failed?  So, we have to make sure that if any component-- any one component on the vehicle were to fail, whether it be a flight computer, whether it be a battery, a solar array, that we can still complete the mission safely and get the crew back home.    Host: OK.  And that-- and I'm guessing the four solar arrays that are kind of pointing out, these four rectangular solar arrays, there's redundancies there too.  For whatever reason, this one's not getting enough power, but you still have the other ones.    Matt Lemke: If this one doesn't come out, a wire breaks, the articulation mechanism that lets it point to the sun, if that's not working right for whatever reason, if one of them fails, we can still finish the mission.    Host: So, how are we working closely with the European Space Agency to oversee that everything's going to work, we have enough redundancies that the crew module is going to be able to talk to European service module and stuff like that?    Matt Lemke: It's really-- you know, at the working level, it's just like working with another NASA center or working with another contractor.    Host: Cool.    Matt Lemke: Right?  So, we work with our Airbus counterparts, we work requirements, we work designs, we have design reviews, we do testing, that sort of thing.  It's a little different contractual arrangement because they're our partners.    Host: Yeah.    Matt Lemke: Right?  We're not paying them to do this, it's a barter agreement between the countries and so the Europeans are building the service module and they bring it over here and we integrate it together and make a whole spacecraft out of it.  But really half that spacecraft is being built by the Europeans.    Host: Yeah.  So, the power-- I-- there was one podcast we did a while back, I'm trying to remember the episode number, I think 28.  We talked with Jessica Vos about living in the Orion spacecraft for what could be sustained up to three weeks.  The mission profiles would be slightly less than that, but everything's going to work for three weeks.  So, is that what the power systems, the avionic systems, are those all meant for three weeks or are they designed to be even longer, thinking about, you know, gateway and missions beyond?    Matt Lemke: Right, they were originally designed for 240 days.    Host: All right!    Matt Lemke: Because back when we started the program, we had the whole concept of-- you know, we didn't have necessarily a destination, so there's a concept of going to the moon with a lander and then letting the crew module stay in orbit around the moon while the whole crew went down to the surface.  And so it may stay therefore up to 240-day missions.  So, we really designed it with that in mind originally.  The mission's changed a number of times since then.    Host: Yeah.    Matt Lemke: But really, especially like for power, as long as you've got the sun, solar arrays will be charging the batteries, you'll be good there.  We'll start getting limited on things like water and fuel as you start going longer.    Host: Yeah.  I want to go back to the avionic systems, the software for a little bit.  We talked about how radiation affects it and how we have these redundancies to think about radiation, but what is actually going on in those systems?  What is the avionic systems doing for the vehicle?    Matt Lemke: The avionic systems, they run on a schedule.  So, 40 times a second our software executes.    Host: Huh.    Matt Lemke: And it controls all the subsystems.  It's doing communications, it's getting commands from the ground and sending data to the ground.  It is controlling the pumps on the cooling system to keep ammonia flowing and keep the electronics cool.  It's running the fans that keep the air circulating.  It is-- when we need to fire a thruster to keep our attitude, it's making those corrections.  When it needs to move the solar arrays to point to the sun, it's doing that.  It's keeping track of where you are, how fast you're going, you know, what rates are you generating on the vehicle, so where are you at today.  It's navigating.  It's doing guidance for when do I need to do a burn to get there.  So, it really handles every subsystem on the vehicle at a periodic rate, just making sure they're all doing what they're supposed to be doing.    Host: Yeah.  It's the backbone for all of these different things that make the whole vehicle work.  Make it all fly.    Matt Lemke: Exactly.  We are very-- if you look at Apollo or even shuttle, you saw lots and lots of switches in the cockpit.    Host: Yeah.    Matt Lemke: Lots of manual control.  We have very, very few switches in Orion.  I forget the exact number, but it's really only there in an emergency situation or when your computers aren't quite doing what you want them to do.  So, like you have switches to be able to turn off the computers.  You have switches to be able to deploy the parachutes in the event the computers don't work.  But, in general, the switches are just there to control power and do some things in case the computer is not doing what it's supposed to be doing.  Everything else is computer controlled.    Host: Wow.  All right.  So, when the crew is quote on quote flying Orion, really most of the flying is being done by all the computers because they're executing at-- like you said before, on this timeline, on this schedule.    Matt Lemke: Right.  The computers can fly the entire mission autonomously.  Right?  So, we're flying EM-1 and that will be without crews to check out all these systems and it'll fly that entire mission autonomously with people in FOD watching it from mission control, seeing if any new commands need to be sent, any corrections to be made.    Host: Right.    Matt Lemke: When the crew is there, they're sitting in front of a console that has a few switches I mentioned and there's also three display units.  And on those three display units, they can have up to six displays displayed at once where they can get insight into what's happening on the vehicle.    Host: Huh.    Matt Lemke: So, I think of it as they're following along with the flight, they're following along with the software.  They have a cursor control device, think of it as a mouse.    Host: Yeah.    Matt Lemke: It's actually by their left hand-- where they can interact with those displays even during ascent.  And so if they do need to take control, if they need to make an adjustment, they can do that.  They also have hand controllers where if they need to fly something or take over, they can do that as well.  But, in general, everything they need to be able to do is done automated and they can just interact with that automated software.    Host: Wow.  Yeah, so there-- when the crew is flying the Orion, when it comes to the-- the avionics software is doing most of it and their job is to just make sure that the avionics is doing its job.  That it's talking to all the right subsystems, that the vehicle is flying normally, and they are trained-- I'm guessing-- they are trained specifically for watching to make sure if something does go wrong, they know what to do.    Matt Lemke: They know what to do exactly.    Host: Yeah.    Matt Lemke: So, they know their contingency procedures.  We even have a lot of the normal procedures they'll have to execute are all electronic now.  So, they'll actually just come up on the display and it'll tell them do this step and it'll actually bring up the screen where they can do that step.    Host: Yeah.    Matt Lemke: Right?  And then the crew just says, OK, yeah, it did what it was supposed to do, I like the values everywhere else, enter, go ahead and do it.    Host: OK.    Matt Lemke: So, it tries to step them through-- so rather than flying volumes and volumes of paper manual that are heavy and take up area inside the crew capsule, we do that electronically.    Host: All right.  So, that's-- I guess that component will be tested on EM-2 when we finally put crew on to make sure that-- well, we'll test the vehicle first and make sure that it's doing its thing without the crew, but then the crew will be able to understand this whole process and make decisions if something were to go wrong.    Matt Lemke: Right.  Now, we're not flying any displays or hand controllers on EM-1.    Host: Right.    Matt Lemke: So, that's being done in the labs, but they're already coming up with all those displays.  And actually a kind of interesting thing that's happening on Orion is the crew is actually developing the displays.    Host: Cool.    Matt Lemke: So, rather than the Orion program, the users, the people that need to interact with it-- there's a rapid prototyping lab in building four south and actually the crew is leading that development effort for what they want the displays to look like, how they want to interact with them, and making sure it's going to work right.  And then once a crew gets each display correct, then they turn that over to Lockheed Martin to go turn into flight software.  But they get it all right first and tested first.    Host: Yeah.  Yeah.  But then, yeah, they actually put the right stuff, the procedures, the processes that the crew understands and recommends into to the flight--    Matt Lemke: Right.    Host: OK.    Matt Lemke: And then they even go so far as to run crew evaluations where they'll have a mock cockpit and they'll run crew members-- various crew members-- through all the different procedures, all the different displays, get their comments, get their feedback, and that way before we spend a lot of money building flight software, we already know we have a product that's going to be good.    Host: Yeah.    Matt Lemke: Versus a bunch of engineers and people thinking what the crew might like, implementing it in flight software, and then when the crew sees it and says, well, I'd like something different, we would turn around and say, well, that's too expensive to change.  So, we're kind of turning that process around to make it more affordable by having the crew give their input first.    Host: OK.    Matt Lemke: And get it right before we develop it.    Host: There you go.  And then-- well, first-- like I said before, we have to test it un-crewed first on EM-1 before they actually interact with it, but, thinking along those lines, you know, we're in the process of actually building the hardware for that mission.    Matt Lemke: Yes.    Host: Where are we in the avionics and power world?  How far are we along?  How many steps do we have until we have all the components ready and integrated into that vehicle?    Matt Lemke: So, we've just finished getting all the components in and tested for EM-1.    Host: OK.    Matt Lemke: Right?  So, the vehicle from an avionics perspective, just a couple little units left to install in the vehicle.  And our intention is to power on the spacecraft for EM-2 in September of 2020.    Host: All right.    Matt Lemke: So, that's when we have all our components built, delivered to the cape, installed in the vehicle, and ready to turn it on-- we call it initial power on-- and make the vehicle start acting like a spacecraft.  And so we're actually already started building some components.  Some of the ones that take the longest amount of time to build and test we've already started on.    Host: Cool.    Matt Lemke: And then we just have a whole schedule over the next couple years to turn them on as they need to be turned on so they're ready.    Host: There you go.  Is that being done here at the Johnson Space Center?    Matt Lemke: The Orion program office is here, but our main contractor, Lockheed Martin, is in Denver.    Host: I see.    Matt Lemke: And then really it's being built across the country.    Host: Uh-huh.    Matt Lemke: I think it's every state, including Puerto Rico, has some Orion business and avionics is spread really in many locations.    Host: Oh, really?    Matt Lemke: Honeywell, UTAS, Ball, GD, SEAKR-- and I'm sure I'm missing many others vendors-- Harris-- across the country are building the components, testing them, and then delivering it to integration labs in Denver to test them out as a system and then to KSC to test them out on the vehicle.    Host: All right.  Yeah, so this is a massive effort.  Definitely a lot of work to be done over these next few years.    Matt Lemke: Just a massive effort.  Takes the whole country to build it-- and then when you add in the Europeans--    Host: Yeah.    Matt Lemke: I think there's quite a few countries in Europe as well participating when they're building that service module.    Host: Awesome.  Are you going to see the whole thing through?  Are-- is that your ambition to--    Matt Lemke: That is definitely my ambition.  I definitely want to see people fly again.    Host: Yeah.    Matt Lemke: Right?  So, at least want to continue this sort of job through EM-2.    Host: Right.    Matt Lemke: And then we have lots of new challenges after EM-2, even.    Host: Yeah.    Matt Lemke: Because after that then we want to get into-- we call it a production mode-- where we can start building spacecraft a little bit quicker, once we've tested them out, and that'll start freeing up resources to build that gateway you were talking about earlier.    Host: Right.  There you go.  A lot of work to be done, but it sounds like there's so much-- so much to this.  Matt, thank you so much for coming on the podcast and describing this wonderful world of what I thought was radiation shielding.  I imagined sort of like, you know, one of those movie shields, but really it's the redundancies and there's a lot of logic to it on how everything works.  So, I appreciate you coming on and describing that for us today.    Matt Lemke: It's my pleasure.  It's fun to come and do things like this and get away from the normal drudgery of, you know, daily business management and talk about what we're really trying to accomplish.    Host: Wonderful.  Really appreciate your time, thank you.    Matt Lemke: Thank you.    [ Music ]    Host: Hey, thanks for sticking around.  So, today we talked with Matt Lemke about radiation shielding and how really redundant systems make the whole thing work.  If you want to learn more about radiation, you can check out Episodes 57 and 64.  You can check out one of our many episodes about Orion.  We have a nice overview on Episode 17.  We talk about how the crew will operate on missions up to three weeks for Episode 28, and then we take a ride inside the capsule for Episode 35.  Episodes 66 and 69 are ones we did recently on Orion's heat shield and navigation systems.  You can go to nasa.gov/orion to learn more about the vehicle itself.  We've been going through some of these topics based on an article called The Top Five Technologies Needed for a Spacecraft to Survive Deep Space.  Really interesting stuff.  Gives a nice overview of some of the stuff that we are talking about in depth here on Houston We Have a Podcast.

                        "description": "Gary Jordan (Host): Houston, We Have a Podcast.  Welcome to the official podcast of the NASA Johnson Space Center, Episode 79, Livable Space.  I'm Gary Jordan, and I'll be your host today.  In this podcast, we bring in the experts, NASA scientists, engineers, astronauts, all to let you know what's going on here at NASA.  So you may have heard our previous episode talking about Apollo 8, the first mission where humans went to the moon.  And we're going back.  This time it's on Orion, NASA's new deep space vehicle.  And today we're talking about how Orion will keep the crew inside comfortable and more importantly alive and reliably too.  We sort of take for granted that we can walk outside and breath fresh air in a nice pressurized atmosphere, but that all has to be created in space and sustained too, and it can be pretty hard.  Every exhale that you let out has some carbon dioxide, and even just a small amount can have effect on the environment over time.  So what do you do about it?  Discussing this topic is John Lewis, Orion ECLSS, that's Environment, Control, and Life Support System manager.  We go into how Orion is designed to make sure astronauts have a livable and reliable environment inside the space craft when they travel through the not so livable deep space.   So with no further delay, let's to right ahead to our talk with Mr. John Lewis.  Enjoy.    [ Music ]    Host: John, thank you so much for coming on the podcast today.    John Lewis: Yeah, thanks for having me.  This is really nice.    Host: We've talked a bit about Orion.  I think at this point we have quite a number of episodes, but we really haven't gotten into I guess one of the most important parts of Orion, and that's keeping the humans inside alive and comfortable, which is a huge part of building a human rated spacecraft, and that's what this is all about.  So we've sent, you know, probes, rovers, all over the solar system, but the furthest humans have ever gone is around the moon.  I think Apollo 13 actually when it wrapped around the moon--    John Lewis: A little further, yeah.    Host: Had the greatest distance compared to all of them.  But let's kind of pull back and talk about keeping humans alive.  What, just basics of what do humans need to stay alive in space?    John Lewis: So, I kind of put it in the thought of if I put you in a box, right, what's going to happen, first, second, third.  Right.  And the first thing that's going to happen to you is the carbon dioxide that you're breathing out from the food your metabolizing is going to start getting to an elevated level, and your body is going to go carbon dioxide is at an elevated level, I need to start breathing more, because that's how I get the carbon dioxide out of my body.  So that's the first thing your body will notice, and that's the thing that we react quickest to.  Because if my CO2 removal device doesn't work, boy, I'm going to get into trouble pretty quick because my levels are going to get up, so I have single digit minutes to hours depending on if I'm in a space suit or I'm in a space craft, and so I've got to react to that.  The next thing, actually even before that, I'll also get wet because everything you drink, half of it goes in the bathroom, and half of it comes out your skin and your breathing, right.  So your half water comes to the top, half of water comes out the bottom.   And that water coming out into the air is going to start condensing on the cold surfaces of the spacecraft.  As the spacecraft is dealing with the cold, the space on the outside, we're trying our best to keep the walls about at 60 degrees Fahrenheit.  And so like a glass here on Houston on a humid day will start condensing on the inside of the spacecraft.  It's an issue, most of our electronics are designed to be able to handle a certain level of condensation.  In space flight, condensation happens, but if you let it persist too long, it would become an issue.  And actually humidity is first because you're putting out a lot of humidity, and it takes a little bit to raise those levels.  You have more time for oxygen.  You have halves of days, depending on your volume, because the amount of oxygen we're used to dealing with in the air is about two-tenths or 20 percent of the air is oxygen.  And so I can breathe down that 20 percent to around 15 percent, and I'm probably still okay, maybe a little lightheaded, but I've got a lot of room there.  Where the CO2 is a fraction of a percent to a percent, and where it becomes a problem is at one or two percent, and so it takes a very little bit for it to start to become a problem and my body reacts to it.    Host: Wow.    John Lewis: And so that's why oxygen, I got a little bit of time.  And then on the longer scale, water will probably be your next issue.  We like to drink about two and a half liters per crew per day and keep them well hydrated.  If you go for a long duration of time, like Apollo 13, where they limited their water, you start to get effects from that, and so you've really got to be careful with that.  Longer than that still, for my area, I have to worry about the trace contaminants, right.  So you get in a new car, you have that new car smell.  We even have the new spacecraft vehicle smell that we had to clean out when we launched ISS.    Host: Nice.    John Lewis: And so, and so you have to watch for those things that make a locker room stinky, right.  And you have to say those, over time, they're not leaking out anywhere.  They stay in the vehicle, and so I have to clean those out because some of them, like carbon monoxide and ammonia, which are actually metabolically generated from us, will get to a level where it'll become an issue in days.  And so we've got to think about how we clean that out of the air.  So the main part of the job is just keeping the right amount of, keeping the CO2 away from the crew, keeping the right amount of oxygen on the crew, keeping the air clean, giving the crew good water to drink, and then being able to take that water, whether it comes in the air or comes in the bathroom and get rid of it and put it in a place where we don't need.  The other thing we have to worry about is when everything is working great, my mission is easy, right.  My whole experience is great.  But I have to plan for what happens if it breaks, right.  And so I planned for two what happens if it breaks.   I plan for one what happens if it breaks, which is, what happens if my system breaks, right.  What happens if the thing that pulls CO2 out fails?  Well, I've got to have another thing that pulls CO2 out, ready to go, flip the switch, and Orion different than on ISS because on ISS, big spacecraft, lots of volume, I have time.  I also have friends in the Russian segment that have other CO2 removal devices, so we can figure out how to make those work.  And if it's broken, I can spend an afternoon fixing it and get it back online.  In Orion, I am a tenth if not a hundredth of the size of, you know, of the ISS at 600 cubic feet, so very small, and I'm also doing key critical maneuvers, and so I don't want to have something break that makes me stop and engine burn or something like that.  So I want the computer, if it's good, to say, wow, my CO2 removal system failed.  Flip on another device, let's get rolling again, and have those online and ready to go.  So, unlike my experience working at ISS where we had what we called ORUs or On-Orbit Replaceable Units, where it's built to unscrew these two things and pull it out, all of our stuff on Orion is flip the switch, turn the other one on, and it's ready to go.   The other thing I have to worry about is what if something else fails.  What if I have a fire?  What if I have a hole in the side of the cabin?  Or what if I have something spilled that is toxic to the crew?  And so there I have to think about putting the crew in a safe space.  In the case of a depressurized cabin, I have to one, allow the crew time to get in their suits, and so I got to, if I have a hole in the cabin, I can support up to a quarter-inch hole poked in the side of the cabin, however it happened, and I've got to maintain the pressure above 8 PSI, so slightly a little more than half of our atmosphere but with enough oxygen that they won't know any difference.  I raised my oxygen actually up to about 4/10 of the environment is oxygen.  I can go that high just to keep, to keep the crew from getting dizzy or lightheaded.    Host: Right.    John Lewis: And so, and so, I've maintained that pressure, and the crew gets their suits on.  They do their leak check, and then they let the cabin pressure go down.  The other thing I have to think about is what happens if I have a fire or what happens if I have a laptop that batteries cook off?  And so I've got to think, you know, the odds of that happening are very slim.  We spent a lot of effort making sure that fire doesn't propagate, and we pick the right materials, but fire happens, right.  You're always going to have the fire extinguisher.  So, I got to think about the fire extinguisher that puts the fire out.  I've got to think about the masks that the crew puts on because in that small volume the air is going to get very bad, very fast, and actually the first thing the crew is told to do, if you smell anything funny, put that mask on, right.  And then start looking because it could get up on you really fast.  Then I've got to be able to provide them with remote sensors because in a fire case, everything is going to be turned off, right.  And so I want to have a stand-alone sensor that says this is what the air is like outside, and it's okay or not to take your mask off wherever you found the fire.   And then I've got to have a way of cleaning up the cabin.  I've got a, and so what we do is we take out our normal cabin air filter, which is just a dust filter, a HEPA filter, to clean up the cabin, and I drop a box of charcoal and other magic rocks, right, that'll absorb and catalyze the contaminants that come off the fire and turn it into breathing air again.  And so, all these cases are things that ECLSS has to think about in that contingency case, you know, on whether I failed, I lost a water tank, I've got to have enough water to get me home.  Or, hey I got a hole in the cabin.  I got to make sure I can support the crew in a depressurized cabin for up to about six days home.    Host: Wow.  Okay.  A lot of layers there.    John Lewis: Yeah, sorry.    Host: No, I like the, it's good, less that, we have a lot of time to break it down.  Going back to your box analogy.    John Lewis: Yeah.    Host: I like that just because if you were to just put the crew in a box and did nothing, here's the series of events that would happen, starting with carbon dioxide.  How little wiggle room you have.  That's insane.  So let's talk about the carbon dioxide removal system and kind of compare it to different things.  How does that work?  How is carbon dioxide actually scrubbed from the environment?    John Lewis: Yeah.  So what we've done in past programs, actually all the way back to Mercury, is we used a chemical called lithium hydroxide, and lithium hydroxide, if you want to play with the stoichiometry, it does a couple different steps and makes lithium carbonate, and it grabs that carbon dioxide and pulls it out of the air.  And so it absorbs it, but now that you've turned that lithium hydroxide into something else, and it no longer can pull CO2 out, and so it's expended.  And so what we've, what has been developed is amine chemical, amines will grab CO2 and grab water, and if you, in a cabin atmosphere condition, they'll hold on tight to them, but if you expose them to vacuum and keep them about the same temperature, they'll like go.  And so what I do is I run the cabin air through it or the suit air through it, and it grabs the water, and it grabs the CO2, and it holds on.  And then I expose that bed to space vacuum, and it let's go, and so I have a series of alternating beds.  Half of them are exposed to the cabin, half of them are exposed to the crew, I'm sorry, half of them exposed to the cabin, half of them are exposed to space--    Host: To space, yeah.    John Lewis: And so then I alternate cycling those beds, letting go of the CO2 and the water overboard.  Very similar to the way ISS does it.  ISS has a much bigger version of it, and what it does, since ISS wants to recycle their water, it grabs the water and grabs the CO2 and then throws the CO2 either to a tank to be turned back into oxygen again and throws the water back into the cabin.  In my case, I really, all I need to do is just get that stuff overboard like shuttle and pass programs and kick it off.  And so the system is a little box about, oh, a foot and a half by a foot by a foot, and every 10 to 20 minutes it cycles.    Host: Oh, that fast, wow.    John Lewis: And it just, it goes through and cycles.  It was actually first used on the space shuttle on the extended duration orbiter mission.  So the long duration orbiter that when Columbia was outfitted to be that EDO mission.  It was called the RCRS then.  It was a very big unit, and it was very cumbersome.  And through development we've been able to make it smaller and smaller and more compact and actually only work with one single motor that rotates four ball valves and makes it all line up and-- because the concern is you never want to have, I have half of my systems exposed to space vacuum, half exposed to the crew, and I never want the two to meet.  Right.  I don't want to expose the crew to space vacuum, and so the way the valves actuate, it assures that what you do is it closes off from the crew in the space vacuum, and it actually equalizes the two beds, one that's been a vacuum and one that's exposed to the crew.  And so I only lose half of my air.  I get to save a little bit of my air, and then it cycles over and dumps the air overboard and then opens the new bed up to the cabin.   And so it's, we've done actually quite a bit of testing on this, and we've done it in suited operations.  The advanced suit development guys were also looking at this same approach on their advanced suits because it just allows you to go deeper and deeper in space without carrying expendables and, you know, with lithium hydroxide, it's a dead end.    Host: Yeah.    John Lewis: I have to throw it out or send it back home to get refurbished, and it's just not with it.    Host: So how about these beds, how long in these 10- to 20-minute cycles can you use it before, do they need to be switched out kind of like a filter?    John Lewis: They operate on order of years.    Host: Wow.    John Lewis: We're trying to get, we seen a unit that we ran in the test labs for about six years, and we've lost about 20 percent of the performance.  So, most of our space flight hardware on Orion is designed for about five years and five uses, five flights.  The years is more of seals and things like that, that'll eventually go bad.  And the launches, the biggest driver is how many times you have to go up and down on the raw hit and land and hit the water.  And so all those impacts is a structural thing, and so it starts cracking it up.  And so you've got to be wary of that.  And usually our life, just like the Mars Rovers, right, we all say well the mission is going to be this short, and then we find out, oh, no, the mission was much longer because up front I'm looking at these really, well what's the worst case?  What's the worst case of all these things?  But then when you find out, you actually have margin in the device.  And so we'll see.  I'm hopeful that we'll get a lot more life out of them.    Host: Yeah.  Now this may seem apparent, but there's a reason why we're just using these beds to sort of dump the CO2 and all the bad stuff outside and not bring it back in like ISS.  What's that reason?    John Lewis: And so if you look at ISS, ISS has a great system where, you know, at one time we had a system that can take the carbon dioxide that you breathe out and mix it with a little bit of hydrogen that you get from your oxygen generator, and you let the carbon go overboard, and you turn it back into water that you then turn back into oxygen.  And then you take all your humidity condensate and urine, and you run it through a couple filters and distillation steps and everything until where it's drinkable water again, and then I've got a water electrolysis unit that I take water and run it through kind of a reverse fuel cell, right, to where I put water in, and it turns it into hydrogen and oxygen, and I can breathe that oxygen, it's like the Russian electron.  And then I use that hydrogen again to help me recover the CO2.  But all of that takes up several rack bays in the International Space Station, so imagine something two meters tall by, you know, a meter wide if not a little more, and there's a lot of equipment in there, a lot of expendables.  And so I've got to think about lightweight.   I've got to think about it's got to work and if I can find a system that has a single valve, you know, then that meets my needs.  All I have to do is two things.  I have to keep crew going for 21 days, and I can, up to four crew.  And then if I go dock to anything, whatever, the Space Gateway or wherever that may be, I've got to be able to hang out there for at least six months.  So my seals and leakages and things like that will be sized by that.  But I can do that with classical gas storage and water storage and things like that, and we've yet to get to the state of the art where the recycling equipment is small enough, you know, we've yet to get the recycling in the box, right.    Host: Yeah.    John Lewis: And there are people that are pushing to develop that, but right, it's always, it's always out there.  And so right now the best weight option is just to let the water and the CO2 go overboard for spacecrafts like Orion but for a long duration.  As soon as you go past a month or so, that's where turning the water back into drinkable water and turning the CO2 back into breathable air is very key, because then you don't have to bring up all those expendables for that.    Host: Yeah, that's a huge difference.  ISS is, I mean it's been continuously habited for years, but for Orion you're talking about 21-day missions--    John Lewis: Twenty-one days.    Host: Up to 21 days, so yeah, you don't really need to have that sort of redundancy.  It's too much weight, too much mass.    John Lewis: Yeah, keep it simple.    Host: Yeah, keep it simple.  Yeah, I like that.  Thinking about the box analogy going down, I think the next one was humidity that you had to be concerned about.  Is it the same system, or is that a different--    John Lewis: It's the same system in our case.    Host: Okay.    John Lewis: The swing beds will absorb humidity and CO2 at the same time.  In past projects all the way back to Mercury and the current EMU does the same, uses what we call the condensing heat exchangers, basically like an air conditioner in your house where you run cold water through a set of fans and you run air on the other side, and the water just condenses out.  You have to be tricky in that system because it's microgravity, right, and the water goes where it wants to go.    Host: Right.    John Lewis: And so you have to make the passages really small, and you've got to put a little bar at the end that sucks the water out and then separates the air from the water, so you have to have a spinny whirly gig thing that separates the water and then puts that into a tank and then vents that overboard or gives it to your water processor.  And then the spinny whirly gig thing is a very complicated, delicate device, and we know how to do it, and we've done it since the shuttle and station, but it is, it is a wear item.  It's a power item, and this aiming system absorbing both of those just makes it much simpler.  I've got three motors, I've got three swing beds, individual and independent units.  I need all three to exercise, exercise to keep your bone loss and everything down.    Host: Yeah.    John Lewis: That's a real high metabolic rate, right, so I'm generating a lot of CO2 and humidity.  And so, and so I've sized for that, but I can go down to a single unit and still get home.  So I actually can suffer a couple failures of units, but all it takes to operate these aiming swing beds is three valves, one on each unit, and it just is a valve that moves 270 degrees, and every ten minutes it does it.  So less moving parts the better, right.  And you worry about the chemistry of the amine and things like that, but the amine has been used in nuclear subs for half a century, right, as soon as we started being able to go down and staying under water for a long period of time.  They started looking and amine there.  Their amine systems take advantage of gravity though, and they're able to, because it comes out as a liquid, and this system has a way of suspending it on a solid and keeps it from, you know, coming out in the air.  And so that's what's been very advantageous is that dual removal.   It's different than the ISS unit because the ISS actually has one part that holds the water back and the other part that pulls the CO2, which is nice, because if you mix them all together, it's hard to separate them, right.  Hard to separate the CO2 in the water.  Yeah, but in the ISS system, it automatically does that and keeps the water back in the cabin to where the air conditioner can pick it up so you can drink it again.    Host: Ah, okay, so it's the part, the logic of that is for the recycling part of the whole-- yeah.    John Lewis: The recycling, right.  I want to, the way I treat my CO2 is different than the way I treat my water.    Host: Right.    John Lewis: For me, it's all going overboard, I don't care.    Host: So you can mix them, yeah.    John Lewis: It's all good, so it doesn't matter.    Host: That's actually interesting, one thing you were talking about was it's such a small environment that you actually have to think about the environment based on what you're doing in it.  So if you're working out, more CO2, more humidity, that requires you kind of jacking up the systems on your environment a bit just to deal with that.    John Lewis: Yes.    Host: That's funny.    John Lewis: And you have to think about well what happens if I don't do that, right?  Well, my CO2 levels will get high or my humidity levels will get high and I'll start condensing on the shelves, and I'll worry about microbial growth in the cabin and things like that.  And so we are, when you put yourself in a really small environment, you realize how much you're driving that local environment just by what you do.    Host: Yeah.    John Lewis: So.    Host: So another thing that you were talking about was redundancy.  Part of your design is you want it to be, you want it to have those redundant systems so if something were to come up, it could be easy to go to another system.  How do those work?  Are they the same?  Is it just the same system but multiples, or is it--    John Lewis: In most cases, we have what's called a like redundancy to where I have, like I mentioned before, I have three swing bed units.  I need all three for exercise, but I can go all the way down to a single and still get home.  So, in that case you have to be really sure that you're not going to have a common cause failure.  You're not going to have--    Host: Right.    John Lewis: This one thing of this design is flawed, and that's why we spend a lot of effort in developing the chemistry, exposing it to as much environments as we can.  We have a development swing bed that we launched up on orbit, the cameras on the ISS, and it's slightly different.  It had a way to keep the water in the cabin, because the ISS didn't want us to waste our water, but we were able to expose that to the space craft environment, because it's really interesting.  You'll find like spacesuit guys and ECLSS guys will always get something broken due to a very small trace contaminant that you will learn the name for the first time, you know, on that failure.  The spacesuit was affected by thiolate esters.  And it's like, what's a thiolate ester.  Well, it's what affected the spacesuit, and it caused its cooling pack to not work right, and it was just this chemical that was found in part per billion levels, right.  And that part per billion levels changed the way that system performed.   And so when I think about this amine chemical, I want to expose it to as much of the spacecraft smell, as much of the human smell, and make sure that it works over a long duration.  Then we take those units, and we expose them to launch load environments and to shock environments and to landing loads environments and high temperature and low temperature, and we make sure they work through all those.  And we actually make sure they work to a percentage over what we ever expect on space, one, because we don't totally trust our math, right.  I trust my math, but I don't want to be so cocky to say that I didn't make an error, so I'm going to push my testing to a little further and get that confidence that over and above that this unit is sized for that so then I can have that confidence of, yes, you can have three of these devices, and you're going to be in good shape.    Host: Yeah.    John Lewis: There's other areas where we have a dissimilar redundancy to where I have my waste collection system, which is running through a spin separator and all these magic parts to separate the urine from the air and to dump it overboard, but if that breaks, partially driven by I didn't have room for two of them, I looked at a much simpler urine collection system, which is basically a bag that I can then hook up and vent overboard, but peeing into a bag when you're in microgravity isn't as easy as you would think, right.  And so there's some mess involved and some things you've got to think about, but we've had good ISS experience with that, and so I've got a, in that case it's a dissimilar redundancy where I've got something that's a different approach that allows me to have a different way of getting home.    Host: Is that part of it too, the waste management, is that part of the ECLSS systems?  John Lewis: Yes, waste management is part of ECLSS.  We take care of everything going in and out of the crew, except food, the food guys take care of that and they do a great job of it.  They make food taste much better than I'll be able to so.    Host: And that's another part that's not going to get recycled like space station, right.  That's another one that everything goes overboard, right.    John Lewis: Right, yeah.  Everything goes overboard.  Urine, we vent overboard, and then fecal, we store in a can.    Host: Oh.    John Lewis: If we are ever going to like a lander, we probably will do like what Apollo did is where they took all their trash and threw it in the lander before they cast off the lander when they came home.  So they took all the rocks out, put the rocks back in the command module, and they put all the waste into the crew module, I mean into the lunar module to get home.  Similar to what we do on progress vehicles on ISS, right.  Get all the good stuff out that you want, then you take all the bad stuff.  You put it in there as best you can, and the challenge always in space flight is just like Murphy's Law, you know, you unpack a box, and it never packs back the same.  And so fitting it all in the same spot is the challenge to do that.    Host: Okay.  But the difference with Orion is you have not as much room to play with, kind of like Apollo, right?  John Lewis: Yeah, we're, we are, so the space shuttle was 2000, 2100 cubic feet.  Shuttle was 350 cubic feet, that's pressurized volume.  We are about 660.  So we are much more Apollo-like and so we get that tight volume, space is key.  That's why if you look at Shuttle hardware and you look at the accompanying space station hardware, space station hardware is very big.  It's loads weren't greater, and so it wasn't driven by, hey, I'm going to have a rougher environment, but whenever you want to be able to remove something, you've got to have big knobs on them and make it to where it's easy to pull it out and the seals were repeatable.  And so a lot of space station hardware is driven by on-orbit replacement.    Host: That's interesting.    John Lewis: And so we've got to drive things small again because we've got to fit everything under the floorboards.  So when you see the crew, the bottom two crew in Orion and sitting on the back where their feet are and behind them and up along the sides is all where the ECLSS equipment is, and it fills it up full.  And we are, I wouldn't like to admit, but we don't totally fit just yet.  We are at our critical design review, and it's part of the design process.  It's is working all the interferences and everything like that to make sure it fits.  And so that's why having something that's on-orbit replaceable is very hard because the space is very tight for us.    Host: Yeah.  That's one of the big challenges is okay now take all this knowledge, shrink it--    John Lewis: Yes.    Host: And make it super redundant--    John Lewis: Yeah.    Host: Which is, increases weight.    John Lewis: Yeah, in some ways we're challenged because we're like the shuttle, right.  I have a shirt-sleeve, 14.7, sea level environment, where Apollo had the 5 PSI 100 percent oxygen environment.  The disadvantage of that is from flammability concerns that Apollo had to deal with the entire program, but there is an advantage of if you get a hole in the cabin in Apollo in a 100 percent oxygen vehicle, you can get in your suit and go down to low pressure because you've already gotten all the nitrogen out of your system.  In the space shuttle, they didn't have to worry about that because they could find a runway.  One, they were a big volume.  They could find a runway at 135 minutes.  Right.  I'm away from the Earth.  My quickest trip home is six days.  So if I have any failure, whether it's a hole in the cabin, I lose a water tank, I lose and oxygen tank or a prop system fails, we always got to be able to get home in six days, and so I've got to think about how I keep the crew, you know, going in that configuration, and one of the challenges from when I'm six days from home, I've got a normal body's level worth of nitrogen in my body, and if I got to jump in a spacesuit, I've got to do prebreathes like the crew is going EBA.    Host: Yeah.    John Lewis: Well, but the only thing is, I'm going to be in my suit, and I can't go as low in pressure.  So what we did is we allowed the suits to, normally a spacesuit operates about at a third of the atmosphere, about 4 PSI.  EMUs operate about that.  And we did prebreathes on shuttle in the cabin environment at a pressure of 10.2, ISS airlock does the same thing, so about two-thirds of the environment.  The lower you go, the more chance that nitrogen has to come out of your body and give you bends and give you that issue.  And so, but spacesuits don't like going in high pressure, because the higher they are, it's basically like a balloon that's holding you in, and you're really stretching hard on that suit.  And so the guys in the suit development had developed a suit to handle up to 8 PSI, and that allows you to do a prebreathe to get all the nitrogen out of your blood and to allow you to go down to a lower pressure.  So that's why we're kind of in this, we're kind of like ISS, and we're kind of like Shuttle, but then we're kind of like Apollo, and so you kind of have the worst of both worlds, right, in some cases, right.   And every time, every time you make a spacecraft from Mercury and Vostok to all the way to the infinite one built, you're going to have to think about how do I optimize this vehicle with the technologies I have?  How do I get it to where everything works at its best and I got the most capacity, and you're always going to be at that leading edge of your technology.  And so we do a lot of analysis and ringing hands and testing and things like that to assure that we've got all the capacity we need, and there are things and areas where I lose a little sleep going well I hope we don't ever get in that situation.  Because I do know that we are right line on line, you know, to be able to make it work, but that's what space flight is.    Host: Yeah, yeah.  No, I guess, so the logic behind not doing 100 percent oxygen like Apollo was the flammability thing.    John Lewis: Yeah.    Host: And that was priority number one.  No, we're not going to have, we're going to make sure that it's going to be a safe environment.    John Lewis: Yes.    Host: I think at a certain level of oxygen is where it will sort of distinguish over time.    John Lewis: Yeah, so what you do, Apollo did it and Mercury did it because there's only so much weight you can throw uphill, and our space capsules were built to weigh about as much as our nuclear warheads, about 3000 pounds, because we were using missiles for it.  And to make that fit, because we made such light nuclear warheads, we had to make light spacecraft, which is kind of a weird flip, and so that pushed them to say, well, a cabin that only has to hold 5 PSI or a third of atmosphere is a lot lighter than has to hold a full atmosphere.  But we've gotten more capable rockets now, and the flammability concern, as we learned with Apollo 1 is severe.  And so, at Apollo 1, they set up a test lab out at White Sands facility in New Mexico, and they burn everything, right.  And they prove that when you set a strip of this and a chamber at the right conditions that that fire puts itself out before it gets a certain length, and so we make sure all our materials self-extinguish.  And that is a function of what percentage your oxygen is.  So, if you look at the air right now that you and I are breathing, I could look at it in two different ways.  I can look at it as I'm at 14.7, 15 PSI, and about 3 PSI of that is oxygen.  And then about 11ish PSI is nitrogen, and there's a whole mess of CO2 and water and other things.    Host: Yeah.    John Lewis: What you and I care about is that partial pressure of oxygen.  Because what happens is, is when I breathe it in, it's the partial pressure across my lungs where I've got blood with a certain pressure of oxygen and air, and it'll actually diffuse across if I have the right partial pressure.  So if you go on the top of Pike's Peak, where it's about 1.8, 1.9 PSI partial pressure, you're going to start to feel a little tingly.  Your teeth start to feel numb.  You're decision processes aren't that good.  Now, fire on the other hand, the way it works is it works mostly on percentage.  So it says, I first order don't really care whether your nominal atmosphere is at 14.7 or 10.  If you get over 30 percent, then certain materials will burn more, and so the higher and higher you get in oxygen percentage, the fire stays at.  And so what I have to do on a spacecraft is I have to keep them—what'll happen is when I get in the lowest pressure, and what sets my lowest operational pressure, which is 9.5 PSI.  So why do I change pressure at all?  Right.  Why would I even do that?  I may come up to a spacecraft, you know, I would love to stay at normal atmospheric pressure like station does, but I may come up to a spacecraft that's at a slightly lower pressure.  I may have a lander coming up from the moon that only designed itself to be about a 10 PSI vehicle because it would become a lighter vehicle.  So I've got to be able to come down in pressure and meet them.  So I try to get a good range to where I can operate at the highest high and the lowest low, and what sets my lowest low is the percentage of oxygen, maximum percentage I can have before I worry about fire, crosses over the line of where I just have enough for the crew to breathe.  And so if I get any lower pressure, I'm either going to set a fire, or the crew is going to get dizzy.  And so, and so that's what keeps me in that box, and so you basically have to look at what my materials are.  So materials are very key at understanding what burns and what I'm allowed to do oxygen wise.    Host: Yeah.  And that goes to some of these other things that you touched on, which was emergencies, you know, what happens in depressurization event?  What happens in the case of a fire?  The first case, the first offense against a fire is the environment itself, actually introducing nitrogen into the environment and bringing that oxygen down, testing all your materials, there's all these different levels.  But you were talking about some of the procedures for fire.  You'd mention extinguishers and masks and stuff.  How does that work?  Is that part of the design to have these things kind of at hand?    John Lewis: Yeah, it's very interesting.  I talked to Dr. Pedley, who is our materials and process specialist, and he, I said, well, you know, tell me a little about what we do for fire.  And he says, well, I make sure that your materials are good with certain margin up to your environment so that no matter how you light them they won't propagate.  I make sure that all your ignition sources, things that will spark, will be arrested and I won't have a, you know, a sparking event happen.  I'll have a circuit breaker that'll pop off and keep that from happening.  And so you control the ignition source, you control the materials, and so that keeps that flame from happening.  And I say, oh, great, I can save weight and not have a fire extinguisher.  He goes, no, you'll always have a fire extinguisher, right.  Because it's, it is, you'd never know absolutely, and so what we're actually, the biggest thing that drives us, so I got two areas I worry about for fire.  I worry about it in the ECLSS bays and the bays where all of the electronic equipment is.  So the parts under the crew's backs and under their seats where all of the computers and everything and the life support equipment are running, and then in the open cabin, I worry about fires in that area.   And there's two different ways I fight it.  The interesting thing about fire is at microgravity fire actually self-extinguishes rather nicely.  Because what happens is on the Earth if you look at a candle burning, and the flame is going up, it's making heat, and it draws up, and the CO2 goes up, and it brings in more oxygen.  If you have fire where you have no free convection or you have no up, the fire basically turns all the oxygen in that area to carbon dioxide and self-extinguishes that localized fire.    Host: Oh.    John Lewis: If you don't have ventilation.  I keep ventilation in the cabin.  I keep a big fan going on to keep the air well mixed or keep the guy breathing connected to my equipment pulling CO2 and humidity out and oxygen well mixed.  But actually when we see a fire in the cabin, the first thing the smoke, I have a smoke detector looking for that, the first thing that smoke detector does is it turns off the cabin fan.  If you turn off the cabin fan, you stop that air moving, and you stand a good chance that the fire will self-extinguish.  Below the bays where all the equipment is, what we did is we said if we can rate the materials there for 10 percent over our normal materials level, so our normal oxygen concentration, the highest we expect to get, then I've got margin that they really won't burn.  So, if at high as I'd ever get in Orion is 30 percent, all my materials were tested to 40 percent, and they showed that, yep, you can light it with 10 percent over, and it self-extinguishes.  And we also showed, we lit fires in the electronics boxes, and we showed that they actually pull all the oxygen out of the electronics box and self-extinguish rather quick.    Host: Oh.    John Lewis: Actually, the guys at WSTF, they're great guys, they love burning things and telling you great stories of how it burned, and they myth-busted that one.  They did a normal electronics box, and the fire self-extinguished.  So then they threw in more material, and it self-extinguished.  They threw in foam and anything they thing that would just ignite, because you never know, some assembly process got some in there, some escaped, and it's also fun to see how far you can go.  And they ignite it, and it self-extinguished.  So it gave us the confidence that, no, that design will self-limit fires.  So, we early on in Orion had an avionics bay fire suppression system similar to shuttle, had an avionics bay fire suppression system, and when you're going uphill, you don't want to think about it.  You just flip the switch.    Host: Sure.    John Lewis: But they also used air to cool their electronics.  But Orion because we are, I can operate the cabin with a vacuum in it, right, because I've got to be able to go spacewalk or I've got to be able to get the crew in a depressured cabin, all my electronics is cooled sitting on a cold plate.  What a cold plate is, it's just a piece of metal with some tubes running through it that the active thermal system is running through water or coolant, propylene glycol water coolant.  And so their electronic devices are bolted right on it, and the heat goes into that.  And so there's no moving air.  I don't have to have an air conditioner down there, and so with no moving air and what my material is rated over a certain amount, the fire safety folks at Glen Research, White Sands, and here felt that, no, you've got enough margins that you can get rid of that fixed fire suppression system.    Host: Yeah.    John Lewis: And the cabin, I've got to worry about all things crew, right.  You know, I've got cloth, I've got laptops, I've got all these things that can be variable, and I've got ventilation that's pushing around.  And so what we actually made a change from past projects and programs and we've actually tested a lot of this out on ISS, the kind of fires that really worry us are battery fires.  And why so, google laptop battery fire and watch the video on YouTube or wherever, and you will see that there is a lot of stored energy in these little devices.  Everybody wants their device to show really bright colors and show the last two or three movies while you're stuck on the airplane and be bright and vibrant and last for a long time.  That takes power.  And so battery makers are getting smarter and smarter of making more and more energy in a much smaller space.  So it's got a lot of high-energy density.  And very rarely those things will short out, and when they short out, they will cause a fire.   And so that fire is self-generating and will propagate, and I can't really do anything about materials wise because it's just, it's just letting that energy out.  And past fire extinguisher systems we've used have been like halon and carbon dioxide, and those just inhibit the fire from interacting with the air.  It keeps it away.  And the problem is that for a paper fire, well that's great, because it take the oxygen away and it stops the fire, but for a battery fire, it's making it's own heat.  As soon as the oxygen gets back in there again, it's going to light off again.  So what you got to do is you got to make the heat go away.  And so we've gone to a water spray fire extinguisher.    Host: Oh.    John Lewis: Because when you spray water on it, that water turns into steam.  When you turn that water into steam, you're pulling a lot of energy out of that fire to turn that water and liquid into a steam, into a vapor.  And so when you do that, you cool the fire way off, and so we said, yeah, we definitely have to go to a water fire extinguisher and actually work with ISS, and they actually, we developed a water mist fire extinguisher for them to prove that it would work on ISS and have confidence there.  The only problem is I hope to never use it on ISS, I've never had a fire.  And so we had a look at that.  The other thing we had to look at is on Shuttle and on ISS and actually on Apollo, if there was a fire, I put an oxygen mask on.  I put an oxygen mask on my face, and remember I talked to you about, well I got to worry about oxygen percentage, right.  My oxygen percentage gets too high, it's going to be a problem.  What was my oxygen percentage limit on Apollo?  Well, it was 100 percent.  So it doesn't matter, you're already there.  You got other problems with 100 percent oxygen, but you're already there and so you don't have to worry about it.    Host: Yeah.    John Lewis: On Shuttle, and even moreover on Station, you have a very large cabin.  And so the oxygen takes a long time to build up.  I have a small cabin, so if I put on an oxygen mask, I would bust through my oxygen limits very quick.  And so we looked at using cartridge-type masks that have scrubbing filters to pull out the carbon monoxides and the acid gases and all those things that are coming off this fire, and so what we've done is extensive testing because we're kind of going outside of an ordinary experience base for us, and you've got to know what comes off of a laptop fire, because now I'm designing rocks to absorb it and keep it from the crew.  And so we've got a whole team of folks that are setting laptops on fire and tablets on fire and extinguishing them and then learning what comes off of them and then making sure I can, make sure the crew breathes clean and that my cabin gets cleaned up by using that same kind of rock to clean it up.   And so it's that, I'm torn between, you know, I have no quick trip home.  I've got a really small volume, and I can't use some of my classic devices.  And then I've got some new things like laptop batteries, which make it more challenging.    Host: Yeah.  One device that's got to filter all of these different things, and is it part of that story that you were telling about, that one thing you had no idea that was like a part per billion, just testing for every--    John Lewis: Right.    Host: Yeah.    John Lewis: And that's it.  You find a lot of these, you know, it's an alphabet soup of these crazy compounds that come off, and there are hazardous to crew at varied levels, and there's even limited data on that.  So the guys in space and life science have been doing a very thorough exhaustive search of, hey, you found this one crazy chemical Y. What is that?  What does it do?  What is the data we have on it?  And what is the limit that we need to clean it down to.  And we know from the fire test at White Sands how high it gets, and so we figured out how much scrubbing we have to do.  And ultimately it all has to fit in the spacecraft.  And we look at there's two ways of doing it.  I can either clean up the cabin good enough where I can take off my mask and get home for the rest of the mission, or if I can only clean it up good enough for the crew to be exposed to it for an hour, is I get in my suits, and I go ahead and de-press the cabin and then re-press the cabin back up again and get a fresh load of air in there to do that.    Host: Oh, okay.    John Lewis: And so, and so similar to shuttles used to purge--    Host: Purge.    John Lewis: Because shuttle had a lot of gas.  They would just open up a vent and just purge it out.    Host: Yeah.    John Lewis: And shuttle also had 135 minutes to find a runway, and for us, we've got up to six days to get home.  And so, again, I have to make sure that the crew, I can get them in a condition that they'll be safe to get home.    Host: Yeah.  Isn't that like an engineer's dream to be part of that team, that test, just like, all right, let's just light stuff on fire and see what happens.    John Lewis: Yeah.    Host: Yeah.    John Lewis: Yeah, and it's fun too because there's a, you know, that's the joy of working like this, is you get to get exposed to people that have an art and a craft to achieve that art, right.    Host: Yeah.    John Lewis: And whether it be lighting fires or figuring out how to make a chemical absorb something or figure out how to make a rocket engine work, and you get to see the passion and the thought that's put into it, and they're all really hard problems.  It's not, I would just add more of that, right.  Just put another set of tires on the back of the truck.  You'll be able to carry more.  It's like, no, there's only, I always say there's only so much paint in a spacecraft, and you just got to move it around to cover it just right.    Host: Right.    John Lewis: And cover it just thin enough.    Host: Yeah.  All right.  So one thing that I wanted to end with, and we can go into a little bit more depth here, is the depressurization event, what would happen.  Because you were mentioning several steps, you know.  If there was a little depressurization, we can do this.  But ultimately, worst case scenario, you depressurize and you have up to six days to figure out how to keep the crew alive and get home.  So, how are those steps?    John Lewis: Yeah, that's one of my biggest driving requirements is the--    Host: Really?    John Lewis: I get a hole in the cabin and you got to get the crew home.    Host: Yeah.    John Lewis: And so, the first thing you got to do is you got to go, hey, there's a hole, tell the crew.  And so we've got a smart sensor that goes, hey, that's not normal.  Pressure is going down faster than it should.  Turn the horns on and wake everybody up, because you got limited time.  Then the computer will look at it while the crew starts getting stuff together and goes, will tell them, hey, you've got 60 minutes or you've got four hours, right.  And that'll be able to tell them is this a fast leak or a slow leak or do I have time to go look for the leak, right.  And so if it is a fast leak, the fastest leak we size for again is, it's a quarter-inch hole, and I can allow the cabin to go down to the half atmosphere, and the crew will get their suits on, and everybody has to do a leak check.  So what we'll do is one guy will get his suit on.  The other guys are still trying to get their suits on, and they're configuring the spacecraft and doing a whole bunch of other stuff.  And they'll hop in, and they'll do a leak check on their suit and make sure it's good.  Then they'll plug in the next person, do a leak check on two, and then three, and then four, and then we also have enough time to say, well, when the last person finds a leak in their glove and they've got to depressurize and undo the glove or visor and cycle it and clear it out, we know we've got a good tight suit.   Because after that, the cabin goes to vacuum.  We'll hold the crew at 8 PSI in their suits, so they'll all be Michelin men stuck in their suits.    Host: Yeah.    John Lewis: And we'll let the cabin go down to vacuum.  That is the challenge because just say to yourself, six days stuck in a suit, and you can imagine that it's a challenge.    Host: Oh yeah.    John Lewis: And one of the things we ran into first was there's the general ick factor, right.  I'm in my restroom for that many days, and no matter what size diaper I wear, it's going to not be able to do it, and the spacesuit guys are working on developing how do I manage that as best to keep the crew from getting any rashes or infections.    Host: Yeah.    John Lewis: But one of the things we found out early is when you urinate, you urinate a substance called urea, and what that urea does is when it gets around microbes and bugs, it turns into ammonia.  That's why if anybody has kids they know the smell of a baby diaper genie and it's, you know, it's ammonia right.    Host: Yeah.    John Lewis: And the ammonia gets up to a concentration where it would be fatal to the crew.    Host: Wow.    John Lewis: And so we have to make sure to get the urine out of the suit and vent it overboard.  And it's in a system similar to Apollo, a little more challenging with a mixed sex crew, but we've got to think about getting that urine out, because I cannot handle that.  And so we keep the crew in suits for those six days.  We think we have enough gas left over after I feed the leak that I can pressurize the cabin up to about a third of an atmosphere and get the crew mobility.  Because they're, remember when we talked about prebreathing at 8 PSI?  It's about 12 hours I've got to stay in that 9 PSI case, and then I will allow the cabin to go down, I mean the suits to go down to 4 to where there's a little bit more mobility in the suits and they're not this rigidized.  Well then I can, right before we reenter, re-press the cabin to about the suit pressure to where there's very little delta pressure across the suit, and so they get a lot more flexibility in the suit.  And so then they can assemble the spacecraft for reentry, get the seats up, get in their seats, get strapped down.  Then I'll let the cabin go down again.   The next challenge is, is I come in through the atmosphere and I reenter.  I'm going to be repressurizing the cabin from the outside because you're dropping through the air so fast the pressure on the outside is building.  And spacecraft are great at holding pressure in one direction, and that's out.  I can hold, you know, 14.7 normal atmosphere out.  I probably can hold twice that, you know, from a design standpoint.    Host: Wow.    John Lewis: And so I've got structure holding it out.  But holding it in, yeah, I can't do anything holding it in.  I can only hold about a PSI in.  So one pound per square root inch higher on the outside.  It'll crush like a Coke can.    Host: Wow.    John Lewis: So we have valves that will open up and re-press from outside, so a big five-inch valve will start repressing air from the outside as soon as that pressure builds up.  So as soon as I get within a half a PSI from outside to in, we'll start repressing.  So I've got two things I've got to do there.  One, first off, I have the crew that is in their suits at about a third of an atmosphere, but the outside is repressurizing, and I've got to make sure to keep them above that or they'll crush and go negative and get squeezed like a tube of toothpaste by the outside air pressure.  So I've got to start feeding oxygen to repressurize the whole system to where when we land I'm always above that pressure.  The other thing I've got to worry about is the outside of a spacecraft is a very stinky environment.  I've got ammonia coming off of my cooling system.  I've got ammonia coming off of my prop system.  Because a byproduct of the propulsion system, the jets that keep the vehicle steered right going through the atmosphere is ammonia, the hydrazine fuels will break down into ammonias that come out.   And I don't know if I'm ingesting those as I'm coming back down through the atmosphere, and so I've got to think about that and worry about that.  And so on normal reentries, I'm going to put that air monitor that I pull out for fire, I'm going to hang it on the wall, and it's going to tell me what the ammonia levels and the hydrazine levels even, even if I have a prop system that's even letting pure hydrazine out.  Because those are very toxic and very low levels, and so I've got to make sure the cabin is clean.  Because the crew is going to look at that number and say, now we can clean that out.  We'll turn on the post-landing ventilation fan and scrub the cabin.  Or guys, we've got ten minutes of oxygen in our suits, and let's go grab the raft and let's get away from the spacecraft because there's too much of a hazardous environment.  And so that whole scenario is if anything the one that makes all of us lose a little bit of sleep worrying about it and worrying the details, and that's what drives the design of our suit systems, our cabin re-press systems and everything, is how to handle that possibility of a depressurized cabin return.    Host: Wow.    John Lewis: So--    Host: It's pretty incredible all these different things that are trying to kill you during the whole space flight.    John Lewis: Yeah, yeah.    Host: But you can still design something where the crew is going to get in, and honestly, I think the crew is going to feel pretty comfortable based on what you've talked about with all the redundancies and everything.  Looking forward to some of these first couple missions, EM-1, EM-2, actually testing. What are we looking for for the ECLSS side of the house?  Where are we going to test some of this stuff?    John Lewis: So EM-1 is mostly active thermal--    Host: Okay.    John Lewis: From the ECLSS active thermal, so it has all the cooling systems.  For us, for ECLSS I has a nitrogen tank and a way to put that into the cabin because the cabin is going to be leaking, you know.  It's going to be up to, EM-1 can be up to 30 days, so it's a longer duration than are even normal.  And so, remember when I talked about how I don't want to have less air on the inside of the cabin than outside, so I've got to be able to pressurize that.  I also have my negative pressure relief valve.  During that same time, we have test facilities down here where we're going to be not only testing the components but integrating the suit loop and the pressure control systems and the chambers here in building seven.  Actually the same chamber that we use to certify the lunar modules and all the EMUs, the spacesuits rather, we do spacewalks in.    Host: Yes.    John Lewis: And we're going to convince ourself that I'll run through the same scenarios that I would in the spacecraft, but I'll do it in a manned or unmanned configuration where I can really push the system hard and know that I'm going to do that.  So we're, as a matter of fact, we're getting ready to start another test to make sure that my oxygen system all the way from the European service module, going all the way into the Lockheed system, that all that system works together and is able to provide oxygen to crew and their suits and in the cabin, and so we're getting ready to do testing late this year and early into next year to really run that out and run it to its extreme.  And then we're going to get a lot of the qualification hardware and integrate that into that same facility, and we will qualify the design that says, you got a hole in the cabin, get in your suit, make sure everything works, and I'll convince that it works.  My system, because I don't have liquids separate from gases, like I did in an air conditioner condensing heat exchange on shuttle, I'm not as much driven by microgravity, and so I can test that a lot on my performance, but I am driven by pressure, so I need a vacuum chamber to vary my pressure around and make sure that works.   And so we're doing a lot of testing on the ground, and in parallel, we're right now doing preliminary and critical design review on a lot of the components for EM-1, and we're going start, I'm sorry, for EM-2, for the manned mission, and we're going to have those component being built this spring and being delivered early summer to the ONC building to start building up EM-2.  And so we're, we're right in the tunnel and getting ready to go on that.  So we'll be, we'll be sitting council on EM-1 and making sure everything is coming together on EM-2 and then worrying about all the tiny details of this didn't work quite like I thought it did or this surprise came up and then working through that.    Host: Wow.  All right.  It's going to ramp up isn't it? This is an exciting time coming up.  John Lewis: Yeah, it is.  Very exciting.  Yeah.    Host: All right.  Well, John, I think this was a fantastic overview of the ECLSS systems.  Everything from just how to make, you know, Orion support the humans to what happens in the worst case scenario, what are we going to do about it.  So I appreciate you coming on.  Thank you.    John Lewis: Yeah, no progress at all.  Thanks a lot.    [ Music ]    Host: Hey, thanks for sticking around.  So we talked with John Lewis today about Orion ECLSS systems, environmental life control, going into everything about how the environment, the livable environment inside Orion is sustained to what happens in an emergency.  You can check out one of our many episodes on Orion.  We have a couple episodes scattered about in no particular order, but it's just depending on whatever you wanted to listen to.  We have a nice overview for Episode 17.  We talk about how the crew is going to operate in missions up to 21 days, more like 16 days, on Episode 28.  You can actually listen to the audio from inside one of the test missions for Orion for Episode 35.  And if you go to NASA.gov/Orion, there's an article called the Top Five Technologies Needed for a Spacecraft to Survive Deep Space.  We've been going around and talking to all experts who have gone through these five technologies.  They're covered in Episode 67 with the heat shield.  Episode 68 talks about navigation.  Episode 74 more on radiation shielding, and this one on ECLSS systems.  We'll get through all five eventually.   So on social media you can follow along with what's going on with Orion on either the Orion accounts or the Johnson Space Center accounts of Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram.

                        "description": "Gary Jordan: (Host): Houston we have a podcast. Welcome to the official podcast of the NASA Johnson Space Center, Episode 146, “Neutral Buoyancy.” I'm Gary Jordan and I'll be your host today. On this podcast, we bring in the experts, scientists, engineers, astronauts, all to let you know what's going on in the world of human spaceflight. We've talked about spacewalking a lot on this podcast. This is where astronauts get in their pressurized spacesuits, so they can go outside of a spacecraft. Nowadays, on the International Space Station, they're usually doing a maintenance task, like swapping out a battery, routing a cable, or upgrading external Wi-Fi. Most recently, astronauts prepared a complicated particle physics experiment called the Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer. Throughout human spaceflight history, spacewalks have been integral in their success. From the construction of the International Space Station, through the servicing missions of the Hubble Space Telescope. These achievements would not be possible without well trained astronauts going out of hatch and performing these complicated tasks. Astronauts are able to do this in space, thanks to the training on Earth. But there's nothing quite like floating in microgravity on Earth. So, exactly how do you train them? It turns out, one of the best places to do it, underwater. And underwater in a specially neutrally buoyant way. Not necessarily sinking or floating. Just right in that Goldilocks zone. There's a facility very close to the Johnson Space Center here in Houston called the Neutral Buoyancy Laboratory. The NBL. Sometimes also called the Sonny Carter Training Facility. We'll get into why. But it's a giant pool with one to one scale mockups of the space station in the water. And it's used constantly for astronaut training. But it's not just astronauts in the pool. There are divers holding cameras and aiding the astronauts and working with the control teams in the facility that are sort of like the mission control we all know and love, but for training in the pool. So, today, we're sitting down with two NBL divers to tell us how this training works. And what life is like working closely with astronauts underwater as a living. Is it a cool job? Spoiler alert -- yes. Yes, it is. Here's life as an NBL diver with two NBL divers, James Fuderer and Kristie Melass. Enjoy.  [ Music ]  Host: Jim and Kristie, thanks so much for coming on the podcast today.  Jim Fuderer: Thank you very much.  Kristie Melass: Yeah, thank you for having us.  Jim Fuderer: It’s a pleasure being here.  Host: Yeah. I wanted to know about what it takes to be a Neutral Buoyancy Laboratory diver. And go into not only that, but just what is this Neutral Buoyancy Laboratory? We've had a lot of podcasts so far. Talked about this place. But like at a super high level. So, I really wanted to understand exactly what's going on in this facility. But I want to start about with your backgrounds. Jim, we'll start with you. Just how did you get to becoming an NBL diver?  Jim Fuderer: Well, my story coming into the NBL is a little different than most of the people that you'll talk to. But I was never actually hired to be a diver at the NBL.  Host: Oh.  Jim Fuderer: I was initially brought in to do water survival training. I worked offshore for 25 years as a commercial diver. And the company that I worked for went bankrupt. So, then, I went back offshore. And started working again. And it just by chance happened that they had an opening. And I, that's how I actually came into the NBL.  Host: But you had diving experience?  Jim Fuderer: I'd been diving since I've been a little boy. Yeah. It's the only thing I've ever done.  Host: What fascinated you about it?  Jim Fuderer: Jacques Cousteau.  Host: Oh, explorers.  Jim Fuderer: Yeah. I wanted to be Jacques Cousteau. Yeah. I wanted to be a member of the Calypso. That's what I wanted to do. [Laughter]. So.  Host: Cool. Any diving tricks from your career that really kind of stick out? Just, wow, this is fascinating? This is amazing moment?  Jim Fuderer: Well, this is, I -- have a diving story. I have diving stories that would probably turn most of your listeners into weeping babies if I was to tell you some of the stuff I've gone through.   Host: Because it really is, I mean when you're diving, there is a lot of safety considerations that comes to the. It's a scary place. You're putting your life on the line almost when you're doing this.  Jim Fuderer: Yeah.  Host: There's a lot of safety considerations when you're doing it.  Jim Fuderer: Yeah. And I've done some really, really extreme deep-sea diving.  Host: Extreme deep-sea diving. Wow. So, Kristie, what about you?  Jim Fuderer: Yeah, yeah.  Kristie Melass: So, I started out as a marine biology major in college. And I got my certification through that, through school. My first dive was actually while I was in college before I was even certified. My then boyfriend, who's my now husband, took me to the Virgin Islands and I did my first dive there. And I absolutely fell in love with it. And thought this is what I need to be doing with my life. [Laughter]. So, it's a good thing I was in marine biology. I graduated from there in 2001. And unfortunately, didn't get to work in that field because I got married and decided to have babies. [Laughter]. I have two children. And I was a stay at home mom for a long time. And then, about nine years ago decided to go back to work part time as soon as the kids got into school full time. And I had extra time on my hands. So, I worked part time at the Downtown Aquarium as a diver.  Host: Oh.  Kristie Melass: And loved it. Loved working with the animals. I did that a couple days a week. And a couple of people that I worked with there actually went to work for the NBL. And they recruited me pretty much.  Host: How about that?  Kristie Melass: Yeah.  Host: Wow.  Kristie Melass: Yeah.  Host: Yeah. What was it about just marine life and diving that really? Was it the same thing? Just it's this whole new world to explore.  Kristie Melass: Oh, yeah. I mean it's just a whole new world. You go down there. And you forget about your life on land.  Host: Yeah.  Kristie Melass: For a little while. You know, it's very meditative. It's very relaxing. It's just the exploration of it all, like Jim said. And it's just fascinating to me.  Jim Fuderer: It's therapeutic.  Kristie Melass: It's very therapeutic.  Host: What, what about it is therapeutic? Is it? Because I've never, I've never gone diving before. So, is it, is it just like you're listening to the ocean? Is it just, it's just you?  Kristie Melass: You hear your breathing. And you have to really. There are so many things that you have to think about at one time. You know, you're concerned with your air pressure. You're concerned with your buddy that you're with. Making sure everyone's safe. You're concentrating on breathing. You're not supposed to hold your breath while you dive. So, you're focusing on breathing in and out. And it's just. You don't have time to think about the other worries that you have in your life. You're just focused on that one task that you're doing. And that's what makes it meditative, I think.  Host: Yeah. It's that focus. Yeah. And, and that separation from the normal stresses of life.  Kristie Melass: Right.  Host: You're just in the moment.  Kristie Melass: Exactly.  Host: Yeah. So, tell me, you said you left Aquarium. And you went to the Neutral Buoyancy Laboratory. Let's go into that. So, what is this facility that we're going to be talking about today?  Kristie Melass: So, it is a weightless training environment for our astronauts. It's named after Sonny Carter, who was an astronaut. He started out, in college he was a chemist. And then, he went on to get his doctorate. He was an internist for a while, a physician. And then, he, while he was in college, actually, he played soccer. He went on to play professional soccer for a few seasons for the Atlanta Chiefs. And after that, he went to the U.S. Navy. He was a test pilot for the Navy. He eventually got brought on as an astronaut. And unfortunately, he died in a commercial airline crash. So, it was around that time that they had, NASA had purchased this facility to put the NBL in, that he passed away. So, they ended up naming the facility after him.  Host: Yeah. Did he do some NBL. Did he do some dive training while he was an astronaut?  Jim Fuderer: No, I don't think so. I've never read anything.  Kristie Melass: I haven't heard anything about that either.  Jim Fuderer: Then again, I might be, I don't know. I've never heard of him --  Host: Yeah. I guess we. Yeah, we can check in on that for sure --  Kristie Melass: Yeah.  Host: -- But to see. Yeah. So, it's named after him. And it's the, what's in the facility? Because we're talking about diving, right? So, obviously there's some water there.  Kristie Melass: Yeah. We have a giant pool.  Host: Yeah. [Laughter].  Kristie Melass: It's 40 feet deep. It's 202 feet long by 102 feet wide. And it contains 6.2 million gallons of water.  Host: That's a lot of water.  Kristie Melass: It's a big pool. If you think about your average backyard pool, it's around 20 to 30,000 gallons of water, maybe. This is 6.2 million gallons.  Host: Yeah. A number of pools. Wow. [Laughter].  Kristie Melass: Yeah. It's, it's 20 feet below ground and 20 feet above ground. And it houses a mockup of the International Space Station.  Host: So, that's what's in the pool.  Kristie Melass: Correct.  Host: It's the, it's the mockup of the space station. Now, why do you need this pool? What is so good about putting space station mockups underwater?  Jim Fuderer: It's the closest environment that we have here to be able to simulate what the astronauts are going be feeling when they get in space.  Host: OK. So, it's, it's like if you want to practice on how to do a spacewalk. If you want suit up. You want to do it in an environment that is the closest to microgravity as possible. Because. And then, use the mockups as a way to sort of say, this is what you can expect when you go into space. You can expect this layout, you can expect this feeling, you have to use these movements. I guess, that's the idea?  Jim Fuderer: Yeah. For a lot of the test subjects coming in, it's, especially seen with the new class of astronauts that just graduated. For a lot of them, it's, it's a whole, whole new experience. Diving in itself is a whole new experience. Just being able to come in and just take the concept of being weightless inside a suit. And manipulating yourself and doing tasks. For the average person, that's something that's never been done before. I mean it really is a very unique experience.  Host: OK. So, what. I guess we have this giant pool. I'm guessing that takes up most of the Neutral Buoyancy Laboratory, the facility itself. What else is there around there?  Jim Fuderer: We have the fabrication lab or the [Logistics and Mockup Facility] LMF right next door where everything that's in the bottom of the pool is actually fabricated right there on-site.  Host: Oh, right next door. How about that?  Jim Fuderer: Right next door, yeah, so. And I've worked over there before. That was pretty cool. And then, we have the high bays. What else we got going on? There's the suit lab that's there. The tool lab is there.  Host: Is that all for the Neutral Buoyancy, the suits are for the Neutral Buoyancy Laboratory? Or are they just like, they're actually like certified spacesuits?  Kristie Melass: They're for the Neutral Buoyancy Laboratory.  Host: OK.  Kristie Melass: They were flight suits that have been worn in space. But have since been downgraded to a class three suit.  Host: OK.  Kristie Melass: So, they're now used in the pool.  Host: Got it. Yeah. You have to have a certain level of quality, a certain level of classification to fly in space.  Kristie Melass: Correct.  Host: But there is a certain safety for going underwater, just it, you know, you can use those suits.  Kristie Melass: Yeah. That's correct.  Host: OK. And then, of course, you have, there's almost like a mission control that's close by too, right?  Kristie Melass: Yeah. It's overlooking the pool. It's on the second, or the top level of the building. But there's windows where you can see from that control room everything that's happening in the pool. And then, obviously, they have all the monitors in there. And we have three different people that sit in there while a test is going on. And a test is just a suited run. That's what we call it. So, you have your camera video operator, sits up there. And your test director, who is in charge of the day's operations. The test director gives instructions to everyone involved in getting the astronaut suited up for the day. And then, he also gives instructions to the safety divers while the astronauts are getting in the water up until the point when the weigh out is done. And we'll talk a little bit more about that later. And then, after the weigh out is done, then the test controller, who is sitting in a different room right next door, takes over. And gives the subjects their instructions for the day. And then, the third person that you have sitting up in the control room is the ECS operator, or the Environment Control Systems operator. And that person is in charge of operating and monitoring the life support system that goes to the suits through the day.  Host: OK. So, there's, there's a lot of elements to -- I guess we talked about what's in the pool. And then, obviously, we're going to get to the fact that you are divers in the pool. But, in terms of what's done in the pool, I guess you're, you're simulating a spacewalk or some activity on the outside of the space station of some kind. And the job of those, I guess flight controllers in this instance, is to like look over the tests, make sure everyone's following the procedures. But then, also, to remind everyone of the safeties and protocols of what goes on to make sure the test itself is going to be done right.  Jim Fuderer: Sure. And for certain runs they come in and they're working on choreographing, for actually when they get to space, they'll start doing their checklists, writing procedures, choreographing working through any kind of problems. It's kind of getting their test run before they actually, you know, find themselves in space working through these problems.  Host: OK.  Jim Fuderer: Yeah.  Kristie Melass: For example, the AMS runs that they just did.  Host: Oh, yeah.  Kristie Melass: I know you guys have talked a little bit about that on this podcast. And from the day I was hired, I've seen AMS runs in the pool. And so, for a good two years, they were perfecting those runs in the pool over and over. And they'd get in. And a lot of it is just R&D. You know, they're trying to develop their runs. And see how long it'll take. And smush it down into the time frames that they have allowable. So, it was really interesting to see the processes and the development of those AMS runs in the pool. And they just recently were successful in doing those runs in space.  Host: And what's funny is, you know, like when we were following along with those procedures what they were doing, it seemed like, alright, here we go. We're just going to do this. And that's exactly what they did. And then, they left. And, you know, six hours later or whatever you're thinking, huh, that looked easy. But you know it wasn't. Because you heard about how, how long it took to really perfect those runs. They had to go in the pool. And they had to think about every angle. And how to use different things. And the techniques to use. There's a lot of work that went into that.  Kristie Melass: Yeah.  Host: And you were part of that then?  Kristie Melass: Yeah.  Host: OK. So, tell me, let's, let's go into the role of an NBL diver. So, take me through. Let's, let's use the AMS run as an example. Take me through, you're about do a procedure for what will eventually be the repair mission for the Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer. What does your day look like as an NBL diver?  Kristie Melass: It depends on what you're doing that day.  Jim Fuderer: Yeah.  Kristie Melass: So, the divers have several different roles. There are so many people involved in a one-day operation that it just depends on the day. But for example, let's pretend it's an AMS run. And Jim and I are safety divers on that run. So, we would come into work that day. We would check the schedule. We would get our gear together. So, we wear two tanks on our backs at a time. We breathe a blend of nitrox, which is a higher percentage of oxygen than regular air. So, you could scuba dive on regular air, which is 21 percent oxygen. But at some point, you have to do a decompression stop. So, the nitrox that we breathe is a blend of 46 percent oxygen. So, that allows us to stay down longer. And not have any decompression limits.  Host: Oh.  Kristie Melass: So, we wear those two tanks filled with the nitrox blend on our back. And after we are done setting up, we get our physical for the day. We have to have a physical every day. Sign a sheet that says we're in good health. After we do that, we go up and we sign the dive suits checklists. So, the dive supervisor is there, making sure all the divers are checked in. Making sure they, they all have enough pressure in their tanks. Just monitor. The dive suit monitors all the daily activities on the pool deck and in the pool, as well as the people upstairs.  Jim Fuderer: See and with that -- on a day like today, Kristie could be a dive supervisor that day. So.  Host: Oh.  Jim Fuderer: Everybody has multiple positions there that you're not sure what you're going to be doing on that particular day.  Host: So, that's part of the checking the schedule, like first thing in the morning.  Jim Fuderer: Exactly.  Kristie Melass: Correct.  Host: What am I going to be doing? What mindset do I have to be in?  Kristie Melass: Yeah.  Host: And it sounds like a lot of it is making sure that you're ready, right? You have to do the physical. You have to make sure, like, you're prepared. And then, that your equipment is ready. That your tanks are filled. That you have all your gear ready to go. So, that's, that seems like the majority of the beginning of the day.  Kristie Melass: Correct.  Host: Now, you said you, that you use the nitrox mix to stay under longer. So, what are we talking about here? Are you down there the whole time during? Because the runs can be like six hours long.  Kristie Melass: They stay in there for six hours at a time.  Host: Wow.  Kristie Melass: We have three teams of divers that get in throughout the day.  Host: OK. There it is.  Kristie Melass: So, if Jim and I go in and we're the first team of divers, we get in for two hours. And then, we have a second team of divers who comes and relieves us in the middle of the day. So, we would dive, say we would get out around 11 o'clock. And they would get in at 11. They would dive for their two hours. And then, we would go take showers, eat lunch, get rehydrated, reenergized. And then, we would get back in the pool for the third shift.  Host: OK.  Kristie Melass: So.  Jim Fuderer: Which jumps around 13:10.  Kristie Melass: Yeah.  Host: OK. Yeah. So, you're. Wow. That's a busy day.  Kristie Melass: That's a busy day.  Host: A lot of checking. And then, just knowing you're going to go right, right back into it.  Kristie Melass: That's correct.  Host: So, what happens when you're underwater?  Jim Fuderer: You. Is. Depending on what position you're filling on a particular role for the dive. If you're safety divers, your primary goal to your test subjects is to be invisible space. You're to be there but, not to let them know that you're there. You're there for their safety. And just to assist them with anything for 1-G just to help them. And just kind of, again, you're, you're. The best way I could ever explain it to anybody is you're just there to be space for them, safety and space. They go to handle a tool, it doesn't float in the pool. You kind of, you magically, you lift it up for them. And you just try to do the very best that you can to make them feel like they are actually floating in space.  Host: OK. So, yeah. Watching over them. And just making sure they don't have any signs that somethings wrong. Is that part of the safety part of it?  Jim Fuderer: Sure. Because the astronauts themselves, when they get in the suit they're already diving before they get in the pool. So, we're looking to get ahead of the game there. They're already subjected to pressure before they get in the water. And then, they're subjected to pressure again. So, again, it's for us to be, not only being space for them and being aware of what's going on and what's listening, you know, what's happening in the suit to the test subjects themselves.  Host: And the other part you said was you're almost trying to give them the extra simulation of what space would actually be like.  Jim Fuderer: Sure.  Host: How do you? How do you train for that?  Jim Fuderer: Practice. [Laughter]. It is. And it's, you. Some -- test subjects need a little bit more than others. You talked about SEALs earlier, Chris Cassidy, which I think is who everybody should aim to be at as far as an astronaut.  Host: [Laughter]. Yeah.  Jim Fuderer: You get a weigh out on him and he's pretty much like, just leave me alone. And I'll take care of it for the rest of the day. Some of the other ones, they need a little bit more help. And that's what you're there for. To be invisible to them. And just assist them and help them the best they can.  Host: OK.  Kristie Melass: A lot of it is getting to know their personalities.  Jim Fuderer: Personalities, yeah.  Kristie Melass: And who likes different things. Like, Jim was saying, if you go to help Cassidy with something and he doesn't want your help, he literally slap your hand away.  Host: So, you're building the basic skills of how to help, if you need it. But otherwise, it's knowing who you're dealing with and working with them.  Jim Fuderer: Yeah.  Kristie Melass: Correct.  Host: So, tell me about Kristie coming on for the first time. And starting to dive. And starting to learn some of this stuff. Like, safety diving and pushing up the drill if he's dropping it. Those sorts of skills.  Kristie Melass: Yeah. It takes a minute to really --  Host: Yeah.  Kristie Melass: -- figure out how to anticipate their needs. For instance, when they go to turn their body into a different position, you want to watch their hand placement. And how they're placing their hands. So that, you know which direction they're about to rotate. And when they rotate that direction, typically you'll want to pull their feet up in that direction that they're going. So that, it's not too hard for them. We don't want them getting any shoulder injuries. They do wear weight packs on their feet. They do wear a weight pack on their lower back and their upper back and their chest. So, we always, we don't want them to inadvertently go heads down. So, we always want their feet to be a little heavier than normal. So, we assist them a lot with holding their feet up if they get in different orientations. So, just learning how to anticipate those movements that they're about to do. It takes a little practice. And like Jim said, a lot of it is just holding up heavy things for them. A lot of times they'll be translating along structure with a heavy bag with a bunch of tools in it attached to their [Body Restraint Tether] BRT. So, we're there to just offset the weight of that bag. So that, it doesn't feel like it's pulling them down or dragging them down. So that, it's easy for them to translate. You have to learn how to kind of help them along. If they're translating, some of them say the water drag is just too unrealistic. It's not flight-like. You know, just kind of push me along a little bit if it looks like I'm struggling. And so, we'll kind of help them along structure.  Jim Fuderer: They have an umbilical, which they don't have in space. So, that's another thing that we're handling is, is moving the umbilical along. And again, making it transparent to them while they're in a suit.  Host: Yeah. Because in, in space they won't have to worry about that umbilical. So, you have to.  Jim Fuderer: Exactly.  Host: Yeah.  Jim Fuderer: Yeah.  Host: Yeah, you're moving that out of the way for them.  Kristie Melass: Yeah.  Host: That's actually a part that I think we should address is like what's going on with the suits. Why you do have to help them in a certain way. So, we talked about that there is a suit lab that's meant for these suits that are going underwater. They're sort of like extravehicular mobility units. But they have umbilical.  Jim Fuderer: They are.  Host: Oh, they are?  Jim Fuderer: Well yeah, I mean it's a -- vehicle.  Kristie Melass: Yeah, they are EMUs.  Jim Fuderer: We bolt that in the suits. So, we can, we can tell you what it's like. It's a vehicle. You're in there and you're driving a suit is what you're doing.  Host: You've been in the suit. What's that like?  Jim Fuderer: Oh, it's awesome. [Laughter]. I recommend anybody try it if you get the chance. [Laughter]. Yeah.  Kristie Melass: He's just saying that because he was really good at it. [Laughter].  Host: OK. Well, what it is -- so, tell me about that. Getting in the suit and working with it.  Jim Fuderer: Well, the, from what part? All the way from the fit process. Or to actually fly in the suit?  Host: I guess on the day of the NBL run. We can take a step back after that. But on the day, you're actually going to do the run.  Jim Fuderer: Oh. See it was, it was great. It was -- everything that you've seen up and to that point, you finally get into the suit. And you've seen, you've seen test subjects struggle. You've seen some sore. Like Chris Cassidy again, you've seen him do some things in the suit. I'm a big fan of Chris Cassidy, by the way. [Laughter]. So, I'm going to say that. True. Must respect for that guy. But you get in. And now, you understand. And you, how you manipulate the suit. And when I say you're driving the suit, you are driving the suit. And the next step, which I would love to find out, is to what it's actually like float inside the suit when you're in space. Never will happen. But when you're there, there's a lot of things that you can do, as far as throwing yourself around in the suit. Not, not, I don't mean necessarily violent. But shifts in the weight. How you get up on your toes. And how you can manipulate all that stuff. How you can fix your own weigh out.  Host: When you get up there, meaning up in space? There's like different techniques you can use?  Jim Fuderer: Well, yeah. In space, for sure. In the pool.  Host: In the pool.  Jim Fuderer: Oh, yeah. For sure, in the pool.  Host: OK.  Jim Fuderer: There's, there's ways that you can get in that suit and you can manipulate that stuff. And you can, you can drive that suit. You really can.  Kristie Melass: You're still fighting gravity when you're in the pool --  Jim Fuderer: Yeah.  Kristie Melass: -- inside the suit. So, the suit is almost like a balloon. And your body is just an object inside that pressurized suit. And your body moves around inside the suit depending on which direction you're facing. If you're on your side, your body's going to fall to that side inside the suit. Because there's room in the suit if you don't fill it totally out, which mostly people don't.  Jim Fuderer: So, when you do that, you figure out, OK, I got to, I got to bend the knee and lift the leg up on the opposite side to get the suit to kind of tilt this way. There's a lot of things going on there. And it helps a lot now with test subjects when you get in there. Because now you can kind of see the struggle --  Host: Because you've been in it. Now, you know what the struggle.  Jim Fuderer: Yeah.  Host: You kind of know what they're going through.  Jim Fuderer: Yeah.  Kristie Melass: Exactly.  Host: So, I heard for the, speaking about those Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer spacewalks. I heard when they were building a mockup to go on the bottom of the pool to work with it. They built it in different configurations, thinking like, OK, if they're in space they're going to be at this angle. But that angle in the pool, they'd kind of be on their side. And they'd be falling up against the side of the suit, which is not a problem that we should have to deal with --  Kristie Melass: Right.  Host: -- for actually working with this. So, they built it in different configurations, so they could be a little bit more upright and a little bit more comfortable.  Kristie Melass: Yeah. That was a really tight worksite. It was really hard for all of us to get in there.  Jim Fuderer: That was always very interesting diving right there too.  Kristie Melass: Yeah.  Jim Fuderer: Yeah.  Host: Yeah.  Jim Fuderer: Not as a safety divers, once you get your test subject in the [Articulating Portable Foot Restraint] APFR. And they were -- working on the tubing inside the next big thing. And it's one of the positions on the diving side, where everybody kind of fluffs off the float position. But floats, the guy who has a camera that documents everything. And in those particular runs, it was always they needed the footage to see for training. And to actually watch what was going on hands on. Because the camera on the helmet only gives you so much. And then, you can back up and get the next level with the float camera. Trying to get yourself in there and not get in everybody's way and trying to get a good shot. And it was a very, very tight work spot when they were going to work on the tubing.  Kristie Melass: Yeah. If you've got two astronauts in the pool. That's eight divers at a minimum.  Jim Fuderer: Pretty much.  Kristie Melass: That are helping them out.  Jim Fuderer: Yeah. And not much more room than what we're sitting at, at this table right here. Yeah.  Host: So, we talked about some of safety divers and their role. It sounds like there's camera divers too.  Jim Fuderer: Float divers. Yeah.  Host: Float divers, that's what they're called?  Jim Fuderer: Yeah.  Host: OK. Now, is that the, is that the full completement there? Safety divers and float divers. And that's, that's your eight?  Kristie Melass: Nope. We've got utility divers also.  Host: Utility divers.  Kristie Melass: So, each astronaut has two safety divers, a utility diver and a camera diver assigned to that subject.  Host: OK.  Kristie Melass: The utility divers kind of flip flop back and forth between subjects. And help each other out a lot. But the safety divers are assigned to a certain subject. And they stay on those. And the float divers are assigned to a certain subject.  Host: OK.  Kristie Melass: And they stay on those the whole time.  Host: Stay on the. So, the float divers they have a camera. And they have their person.  Kristie Melass: Yep.  Host: And they're training that camera on the person.  Kristie Melass: That's right.  Host: Now, what is the utility diver do?  Kristie Melass: The utility diver does a lot of things. The utility diver gets in and sets up the worksite for that days run. Or the next days run. It's a lot of reconfiguration of the pool. We move certain things around depending on what's going to be happening the next day or the day of. And they go get the tools that that astronaut needs. And they move around the hi-fi APFR's.  Jim Fuderer: They're grunts.  Host: They're the APFR, that's the foot restraint?  Kristie Melass: Right.  Host: So, they're moving it. They're basically getting the worksite ready for the day.  Kristie Melass: Correct.  Host: OK.  Kristie Melass: Yeah. And while they're working, a lot of times they'll have to move APFR's from one location to the next location. And the subject can't move the hi-fi APFR's because they're so heavy. You have to use a little lift bag to move them sometimes.  Host: Oh, wow.  Kristie Melass: So, the utility divers will do that for them. And basically, just have the tools ready to go. And swap out lo-fi for hi-fi tools. What I mean by that is, we have two versions of tools that they use. We have a lo-fi and a hi-fi. The lo-fi is made of plastic. And it essentially floats or is neutral in the pool for the most part. And the hi-fi tools are very heavy. And they're made of either aluminum, titanium, or stainless steel. And the reason for that is when the astronauts are translating, we don't want them to be translating with really heavy tools that are going to pull them down. We want them --  Jim Fuderer: Which is something that you're carrying with them too, so.  Kristie Melass: Right.  Jim Fuderer: Yeah, yeah.  Kristie Melass: Helps us out too.  Jim Fuderer: Yeah.  Kristie Melass: So, they will translate with their lo-fi tools, the plastic ones that don't weigh anything. And then, or they'll have them on their mini workstation. And then, when they go to use them, the utility diver will swap out the lo-fi for the hi-fi. So, they can actually use the hi-fi working tool.  Host: Lo-fi is really just to understand, while you're translating moving, while you're moving across the outside of the space station, it's just to have a feel for what it feels like to have those tools around you.  Kristie Melass: Correct.  Host: And you talk about your mini workstation. This is the workstation right in front of you. So, you've got all these tools attached to you. That's how you carry it in space. So, just to get a feel for that. But actually, working with it, now that's a different thing.  Kristie Melass: That's right.  Host: Actually, having like a drill to drill that actually is going to turn and do the things that you expect it to do.  Kristie Melass: Exactly.  Host: Now, I know that one thing that comes to mind when it comes to the drill is like torque. So, is there. You know, you talked about having a heavy tool and basically pushing it up being one of the elements. Is there an element of whenever they're drilling to simulate that torque and the spin that they may encounter in space? Is there anything like that?  Kristie Melass: Not in the pool that I've seen.  Jim Fuderer: Not in the pool.  Kristie Melass: No.  Jim Fuderer: No.  Jim Fuderer: We do. The test subjects do carry a lo-fi [Pistol Grip Tool] PGT. And then, when they get on location, they'll bring that out again. That's one of the things the safety divers, the utility divers, they'll bring it out the one that they're carrying with them. And they'll swap over to a hi-fi PGT. Then, you turn.  Host: That's that -- That's that drill. Yeah.  Jim Fuderer: Try to make the handoff just as if, you know, it came out their hand, boom it's in their hand again. And then, go ahead and engage in whatever, whatever they're working on.  Kristie Melass: That's one of the issues is that the water drag in the pool is the opposite of what's going to happen in space. So.  Host: Oh, yeah.  Kristie Melass: That's one of the issues. So, in space, it'll be really easy for them to move along. And stopping would be the challenging thing. Or staying stationary would be the challenging part in space. In the pool, it's exactly the opposite. It's really easy for them to stay stationary.  Host: Just to get moving. They got to press up against that drag.  Kristie Melass: Right.  Host: Interesting. So, Jim, you talked about fitting for the suit. We talked about being in the suit for, for them. Now, what's -- That sounds like it has some elements to it for astronauts before they even go in the pool, before they're ready for that day. They have a lot of work ahead of time to make sure the suit's going to fit them nice.  Jim Fuderer: They do. And they do a pretty, they do a good job for us. And I can just assume that they probably do a stellar job for them.  Host: Yeah.  Jim Fuderer: You talk to a lot of the guys working at the NBL who have been there for a long time. They used to do the suit fits where'd they'd actually take the measurements with tape. Now, you come over here on-site. And they strip you down to your skivvies. And they tape a bunch of gray balls on you. And they laser scan your body.  Host: Oh, fancy.  Jim Fuderer: Yeah. And it's kind of. It's beneficial to not only the suit engineers. It's practice for them on, on sizing up the suit like that. But then, they're starting to be able to collect data for future people getting into suits. I mean, we're going to have a good idea of what the average size is. And what the different sizes of people are. And then, when they come back, and they analyze all that -- information, they start piecing together a suit for you. And they give you the opportunity to go in a suit they have on-site, or at the NBL. Excuse me. And they work with you starting with the gloves. You go in there. And put on a pair of gloves. And you can start telling them exactly what you're looking for, as far as fit. And those gloves are very, very, the ability to adjust them to a very fine thing. It's pretty good.  Kristie Melass: It takes three hours.  Jim Fuderer: Yeah.  Kristie Melass: If that gives you an idea.  Host: Just for the gloves.  Kristie Melass: Yeah.  Jim Fuderer: Yeah. And you do, if you go in there and you know what you're looking for. And tell the engineer, especially when Mitch was there. You could tell them, and they'll size those things up exactly what you're looking for. And then, they put you in a pressurized chamber. They pressure them up. Manipulate some tools in there. And say, yeah, I'm good. I'm happy with those gloves. And then, that's done. It's on the. Check that off.  Host: Done three hours later. [Laughter].  Kristie Melass: Yeah.  Jim Fuderer: Yeah.  Host: So, what are you looking for when you're looking for a good fit? You want it, you want it tight. You want to make sure that the fingers are the precise length. What are the, what are the key elements?  Kristie Melass: Yeah. You're looking for length. And you're, you want to make sure that when you're using them that you don't have any hot spots on your hands anywhere.  Host: Hot spots.  Kristie Melass: And that it's not rubbing --  Host: Rubbing.  Kristie Melass: On your knuckles. Because you're, that's your most. I think, it's the most important part of your suit is your glove fit. Because you're using your hands the most throughout that day. And it's really, really hard to even grip a tool in those pressurized gloves. Because you're fighting the pressure of that suit. So, just to grip something takes a lot of strength and effort. And if you have something rubbing on your knuckle the whole six hours while you're down there, that's going to be a problem.  Host: Wow.  Kristie Melass: So.  Host: Yeah. That's a very important thing. And you put them in a glovebox and start working with it. And that's where you can identify some of those hot spots where you can figure out what's rubbing. Because you don't want to have, you don't want your fingers like all scratched up --  Kristie Melass: Yeah.  Host: -- when you're, by the end of the six hours.  Kristie Melass: And you don't want your nails being jammed into the ends of the fingers either, because that can cause a lot of damage too.  Host: Now, if you were looking at a suit. I was lucky enough to watch a suit up this morning. And it was. I thought it was. It was kind of interesting. Because they laid down this.  Jim Fuderer: The LTA.  Host: What is it called?  Jim Fuderer: The LTA. The lower torso assembly.  Host: The lower torso. Yeah. And then. And then, I think it was Nick who was the diver. He laid down right on his back. And they were pushing the pants up. And they had to like work the boots. So, it's like, even the whole thing was just like, it required three people helping him just to put this thing on.  Jim Fuderer: Yeah.  Kristie Melass: Yep.  Host: Yeah. That's tight. There's a lot of work that goes into that.  Kristie Melass: It's really heavy too.  Host: It is.  Kristie Melass: So, it's difficult to get in it.  Host: Oh, OK. And that's part of the reason why you need so many. Because it's a heavy piece of equipment.  Kristie Melass: It's really heavy. And the inner lining sort of bunches up around the ankles and feet. So, it takes a lot of wiggling to get in there.  Jim Fuderer: So, what you saw this morning were the suit engineers helping Nick get into the suit.  Host: Yeah.  Jim Fuderer: And they're there to assist him getting into the LTA. And they're also there to make sure that the LTA doesn't get damaged in that process. Because again, it's, it's pretty robust. But it still has its fragile parts. So, yeah, I need to get you in there. But we got to make sure again, that we don't damage the suit.  Host: Right. OK.  Jim Fuderer: Yeah.  Host: So, that's step number one. You got to. Well, first of all, when you're coming out, you come out in the liquid ventilation and cooling garment. It's the, it looks like a --  Jim Fuderer: LCVGA. --(sic) --   Host: LCVGA. -- (sic) --  Jim Fuderer: Yeah.  Kristie Melass: [Liquid Cooling and Ventilation Garment] LCVG.  Host: Yeah. And it comes almost like a jumpsuit. Like a --  Jim Fuderer: Looks like long johns.  Host: -- Long johns.  Jim Fuderer: Yeah.  Host: Like one-piece pajama or whatever. And it has tubes all across. Now, why do you have to wear that?  Kristie Melass: To cool your body while you're working.  Host: OK, because it could be hot in there?  Kristie Melass: It's very hot in there when you start working. It's just an enclosed. You have some airflow in there. Because you're breathing, gas is flowing through there. But it gets warm when you're working in there. So, you want this garment to cool you while you're working. And the water that we flow through there.  Jim Fuderer: Oh, it's very warm. Well, yeah -- its, OK So, the water, the pool itself is extremely warm. So, again, you're working in the suit. Your umbilical's traveling across all that warm water as it comes out to you. It gets, it gets warm inside the suit really quick.  Kristie Melass: It does. But that cooling water that goes through the umbilical and through your LCVG that you're wearing is coming out of the chiller at about 37 degrees. So, by the time it gets to your body, it's probably in the 50's. So, it feels really good.  Jim Fuderer: Really good, yeah.  Kristie Melass: And the environmental and control systems operator, who's sitting up in the, our little mini mission control room.  Jim Fuderer: And Kristie does that too.  Kristie Melass: I do that.  Host: Oh, you're an environmental person too.  Kristie Melass: Yes.  Host: Alright.  Kristie Melass: The person up there can control your waterflow. So, if the subject says ECS, this is EV1, you know, I'm getting a little warm. Can we bump up my cooling by 20 GPH? Then, we have that ability to bring his cooling up or down. So.  Host: So, they come out with the, with the tubey pajamas. But then, it's actually the water that's coming into the suit to flow around. That's coming through the umbilical.  Kristie Melass: Correct.  Host: OK. So, you got to hook it up to the suit.  Kristie Melass: Yes.  Host: OK. Now, and it comes out at 50 degrees. That's kind of nice.  Kristie Melass: Yeah.  Host: Yeah. And I guess that, because that's necessary for six hours. You would definitely overheat.  Kristie Melass: Oh yeah.  Host: Being in a hot suit for six hours.  Kristie Melass: Yeah.  Host: What else is in that umbilical? You got water flowing through.  Kristie Melass: You have your -- so, yes, you have your water. And then, you have your communication line for your comms. And --  Host: To ask for cooler water. [Laughter].  Kristie Melass: Exactly. And then, you have your video cable that runs through there for the little helmet cam that they wear. And you have your gas flow going through there. You also have some transducer wires that are going through there for --  Jim Fuderer: Monitors depth.  Kristie Melass: Yep.  Host: Oh, OK.  Kristie Melass: All that.  Host: Are they breathing the same thing that the divers are breathing, the --  Jim Fuderer: Nitrox.  Host: The nitrox. They're breathing the same thing. OK. Alright. So, now, we're. Yeah. We're going underwater. Oh, I forgot to. We only got to the pants when we were talking about the suit.  Jim Fuderer: I dive only in pants. [Laughter]. Put a bucket on my head and I'm good to go.  Host: Look at that. Yeah, that's how you know you're a pro. No, you put on the pants. And you're doing that sort of next to this, this crane. And on the crane is mounted the upper torso of the suit.  Jim Fuderer: The hut.  Host: The hut.  Jim Fuderer: Yes.  Host: OK. So, how do you? Now, I've seen, I've seen divers and astronauts try to wiggle into that hut. There's a technique that looks like --  Jim Fuderer: There is a technique.  Host: Yeah.  Jim Fuderer: And it's, it's different for everybody. You see the same faces go in. And different faces when they come out on the other side. But it's a tight fit when you get in there.  Kristie Melass: Get a couple bruises usually doing it.  Jim Fuderer: Yeah. [Laughter].  Host: Do you really?  Jim Fuderer: Yeah, because it's. You saw this morning. You come in from underneath. And you, yeah, whatever your dominant arm is, it seems the side that you're going to feed up. And you try to get up through your arms and pass it through the opening for the hand is. And then, you kind of flex your elbow and your shoulder. And you allow your other part of your arm to squeeze in it. And at this part, you're almost too blocked. Until you just kind of wiggle your way up and get your hands up. And then, you can make the commitment to standup.  Host: Wow.  Jim Fuderer: Yeah. It's, it's interesting. Yeah.  Host: And you need, you need those suit technicians nearby to help. This is where there's -- they're plugging in the LCVG. This is where they're buckling you. They're connecting all of the bearings. And they, they basically make sure you're ready and sealed tight. So, when they actually drop you in, you're ready to go.  Kristie Melass: Yep.  Host: Now, what happens when you get to that point. You have your helmet on. They're checking out everything. And you're ready to go. So, what happens when you're in the suit. And they say, OK, time to put you in the pool?  Jim Fuderer: Hurry up, take the picture, so I can get in the water and get to work. [Laughter].  Host: Yeah. That's my job as the PAO. I'm the one that bugs you right before you go in and say, “hey, selfie.”  Jim Fuderer: Yeah. It's. They go through a series of, you know, comms. Make sure that the suits working well. They pressurize the suit to four PSI inside the suit before they actually put you in the water. And once they have an OK. And everything looks like it's holding, we don't have any leaks. That's why the suit engineer's there to monitor that. We go ahead and pick them up and we make the commitment to put them in the water.  Host: OK.  Kristie Melass: The safety divers are waiting right there in the water when the crane goes in. And once we make sure that comms are OK. And the suit engineer gives the OK. Then, we pull them off the donning stand. And we do their initial weigh out. So, that just means that we make sure that they're going to be easily controlled by one person. So, we don't want them so heavy that they start plummeting to the pool floor. And we don't want them so light that you can't drag them down. So, we do their initial weigh out. We just get them pretty much neutral to where they're easily manipulated.  Jim Fuderer: And it's, that's, captured with some of the senior guys who have come in over and over again. You have a pretty good idea. It was interesting when we had the new class. You'd put them in. And you were starting from scratch. And again, they're still learning how to manipulate their suit and the tools. And the weigh outs were changing, morphing a lot. It was, it was interesting taking part in that process right there.  Kristie Melass: And we keep a record of everyone's weigh outs. So, when they get in for the first time and they've never been in, obviously we don't have a weigh out record for them on how much weight goes where. And depending on their body size, it's either going to be weights or foam up top on their upper torso. If they're a really muscular subject, then they're going to need some foam in their upper torso to keep them balanced right. If they're a tinier girl, then they're going to need a lot of weight in their chest or their back to keep them balanced out right. So, we keep a record of all that. So, the last time that they get in the suit, we update if there are any changes. We update that in the computer. And we use that for the next time that they get in. So, that's what we mean when we say weigh out.  Host: So, when they're about to do a run, they have. I guess, if you're looking at the suit, they got all these like pockets, I guess, all these little pouches around the suit where you can put weights and floats as necessary, whatever they have, whatever you've identified as part of this weigh out.  Kristie Melass: Right. They have a pack in their chest. A pack in their upper back. One in their lower back. And one on each foot.  Host: One each foot. OK. Yeah. Because the idea is. And this is where this term comes from. Neutral buoyancy.  Kristie Melass: Correct.  Host: Is to make it as space-like as possible. You don't want them sinking. You don't want them turning in the middle of a, in the middle of a run.  Kristie Melass: Right.  Host: That's the idea.  Kristie Melass: Yeah. And because that suit is pressurized, it floats. [Laughter].  Host: OK. Yeah. That makes sense.  Kristie Melass: So, you have to have a little bit of weight somewhere just to bring them down in the water.  Host: Now, this morning I --they. There was some. And you'll have to forgive me. Because I recognized Nick. But there was a new diver on the other side. And so, when they, they took this crane. And they put the tubed, suited divers up. And then, they drop them slowly into the pool. The other diver came back up. And I guess they did this pop test or something.  Kristie Melass: Yeah.  Host: What was that all about?  Kristie Melass: That's a glove pop.  Host: Glove pop.  Kristie Melass: Yep. And we do that with every subject when they first go into the pool for the first time. So that, they know what that feels like. And what to do should they experience a rapid depress of the suit. Because it can happen. You could have a rapid depressurization because you get a bearing blowout, or something happens. So, they get to experience the effects of that. And when that happens, all the air escapes. And it collapses around you. Feels like a big hug. And then, you know what that feels like. And you're supposed to keep your airway open because it's going to be a change in pressure. So.  Host: It's a way to identify if this were to occur, this is what it feels like. And then, this is the technique you use to, you know --  Kristie Melass: Correct.  Host: Minimize risk to yourself.  Kristie Melass: Correct.  Host: OK. Yeah. And he did that. And I guess, I guess he did fine.  Kristie Melass: Yeah.  Host: And some of the safety divers were around to check that. And there was a physician that was around too to make sure that he was OK.  Kristie Melass: Yeah.  Host: Now, what else goes into the training here? Because I know you have some chambers. Speaking about the Neutral Buoyancy Laboratory, there's some chambers off to the side. They're, like you mentioned, Kristie, the pool is 20 feet above the ground, 20 feet below. But if you go to that, you know, not. The deck is at the very top. If you go 20 feet below, there's these two chambers. A hyperbaric and a hypobaric. And what are those about?  Jim Fuderer: The decompression chamber is for treating any diving illnesses that we may incur in the pool. One the reasons why we breathe nitrox is to almost, I don't want to go as far as guarantee that it doesn't happen. Because diving is not an exact science. You never know when all the planets might align for you on that particular day that you might actually catch a sickness. And that's what it is.  Host: OK.  Jim Fuderer: But, it's there to treat anybody, either the divers or test subject, just in case they start to show any symptoms of decompression sickness.  Host: OK.  Jim Fuderer: And the other ones the altitude chamber. And I've been dying to get in there. But I can't find anybody to pay for me to get a run. [Laughter].  Kristie Melass: Same.  Jim Fuderer: Just to try it out. Yeah.  Host: And what is that? What is the altitude chamber?  Jim Fuderer: It's a -- the exact opposite of pressing you underwater. Here, I'm taking you to higher altitudes and a lack of oxygen. So, seeing I guess the effects of lack of O2 on the brain right before you pass out.  Kristie Melass: A lot of pilots.  Jim Fuderer: Yeah, pilots.  Kristie Melass: Train in the hypobaric chamber.  Host: OK.  Kristie Melass: So that, they can feel that those effects. And it sort of has almost a narcotic effect to where they can't do basic motor skills, like sign their name. So, they want to recognize those symptoms should they experience them while they're flying.  Host: Is it called hypoxia? Do I have that right?  Jim Fuderer: Yes.  Host: Yeah. Where you have that deprivation. And the idea is to identify your systems, or symptoms. So, if it does happen, you kind of know, oh, this is happening now. I better save myself somehow. OK. OK. Now, there's a lot to this. And speaking of going around the facility. Jim, you mentioned a couple other places. One of them was the tool lab.  Jim Fuderer: The LMF.  Host: Yeah. And are you, as divers are you working on some of the tools?  Kristie Melass: Sometimes.  Host: OK.  Jim Fuderer: So, yeah. Yeah. So.  Kristie Melass: Not the tools that the astronauts use in the water. But we work on a lot of the mockups that are in the water.  Host: Oh.  Kristie Melass: We have maintenance period that happens twice a year. Every six months, we pull out some of the big mockups with the big Demag cranes. You probably saw them. There's two of them.  Jim Fuderer: The overhead cranes.  Kristie Melass: On the ceiling.  Host: Like the 20-ton cranes or something.  Jim Fuderer: Yes.  Kristie Melass: Yeah. We use those to pull out the big mockups.  Host: OK.  Kristie Melass: And for a week or two weeks or however long maintenance period is that time, we'll just work on them. We'll make them pretty again. Replace all the rusted-out parts. Or the labels. Or replace the foam that is missing in them. Or if they have any cracks or need any repairs.  Jim Fuderer: The NBL is an extremely unique facility. And I mean that sincerely. I'm happy every single day I come to work. So, happy that I drive from Katy to come to work here at the NBL.  Host: That's a far commute.  Jim Fuderer: Yeah. So, I'm -- anybody listening, you know I'm sincere about what I'm saying. And where I'm going with that is, again, we're talking about us, the divers who dive specifically with the test subjects. But just about everybody in that building has a diving role. You have your full-time divers. And then, you have divers that have other tasks that fill in for second team and anybody else. And over, again, like in the LMF, the fabricating part of it. We have guys over there that work on the mockups and do over there. And then, they come over and they do the work in the pool, the maintenance stuff. Specifically, why the gear is still in the pool.  Host: So, you love it because it sounds like it's different all the time. It's -- you're changing all the time.  Jim Fuderer: It's different all the time. The people there are extremely cool. Very professional. And we're very diversified with the different diving experience that we have there at the facility. It's a very, very unique, very cool place to work.  Host: So, is just doing these runs often enough to keep up a certification and training? Or is there training and swimming tests? Or any kind of like.  Jim Fuderer: Well, yeah.  Kristie Melass: Yeah.  Jim Fuderer: Yeah. It's --  Host: That's part of it?  Kristie Melass: We have to keep up our quals. Usually are once a year are most of the qualification tests that you have to do. We have to do a swim test once a year. A surface swim test. We have to do our dive skills once a year to keep up our certifications. We have numerous --  Jim Fuderer: The initial swim test is a badge of honor.  Kristie Melass: Oh, yeah.  Jim Fuderer: To become a safety diver.  Host: Oh, it's a hard. I'm guessing, yeah, it's pretty hard.  Jim Fuderer: Oh, yes. It's a, it's a -- you earn your badge with that test.  Kristie Melass: You do.  Jim Fuderer: Yeah. You do.  Host: What are we talking about here? Is it like 100 laps or something?  Kristie Melass: Well, just the interview swim test. So, there were several parts to the interview process that we had to go through. But the swimming part of the interview was, I think, eight laps.  Jim Fuderer: Yeah, it was eight laps in 12 minutes or less. And a lap is width wide. So, there and back is one lap. So, you have eight, eight of those laps to do in 12 minutes.  Kristie Melass: In 12 minutes.  Jim Fuderer: Twelve minutes or less.  Host: I think it's 101 feet wide. Am I right in saying that?  Kristie Melass: A hundred and two, 102 feet wide.  Host: A hundred and two feet wide. So, you're talking 204 feet is a lap.  Jim Fuderer: About that. Yeah. I know the total volume of the pool if I got this correct is the size of two football fields.  Host: Oh, OK.  Jim Fuderer: Yeah. So, it's, it's pretty, it's big.  Host: Wow.  Jim Fuderer: So, that's just the surface swim. And then, right there you get a little break. And then, you tread water.  Kristie Melass: Yeah. We had to do two minutes of a tread with our shoulders up out of the water.  Jim Fuderer: Yeah.  Kristie Melass: And then, two minutes with our hands out. And then, six minutes just regular tread. So, that was our 10-minute tread segment. And then, after that, you get a little break. And you have to do your underwater breath hold swim.  Jim Fuderer: Fifty-yard swim. Yeah.  Kristie Melass: And then, after that process is over. When you're being qualified to be a safety diver. To start your safety diver training, you have to pass an underwater swim test with all your scuba gear on. So, you go down about 20 feet. And you swim two laps around the perimeter of the pool in under six and a half minutes.  Jim Fuderer: Six and a half minutes. Yeah.  Kristie Melass: And then, that's just hard to begin with.  Jim Fuderer: You're -- pumping the entire time. There is no, there is no slacking on that swim.  Host: Wow.  Kristie Melass: And then, they give you a four-minute break. And you've got to go down on the bottom of the pool and pick up the hard-upper torso portion of the spacesuit.  Jim Fuderer: The part that you saw hanging on the donner stand this morning.  Host: Oh, OK.  Kristie Melass: That shell. You pick that up. You put it over your head. Or however you want to hold it. And push off the bottom of the floor. And you're not allowed to have any of your, any air in your BC while you're doing this. And you have to just hover over the bottom of the pool floor without letting your fins touch. You have to do that for a couple minutes. If you pass that part, then you get a four-minute break. And then, they put a dummy inside that hard-upper torso.  Jim Fuderer: And he weighs about 220 pounds.  Kristie Melass: He weighs a lot. [Laughter]. He's a big boy. You throw him over your shoulder. And then, you have to rescue him. And swim him from the bottom of the pool up to the surface.  Jim Fuderer: With no air in your BC.  Kristie Melass: With no air in your BC. And it is a challenge. I think I did that test 10 or 12 times before I passed. You have to pass all of them.  Jim Fuderer: Consecutively.  Kristie Melass: Consecutively. And if you fail one portion of it, you have to start over from the beginning the next time.  Host: Wow. That is rigorous.  Kristie Melass: Very rigorous.  Host: But what comes out are the best divers you can probably get for.  Jim Fuderer: It's a way of weeding out.  Kristie Melass: Yeah.  Jim Fuderer: And again, it's all about the safety of the test subjects. You need to. I need to know that I have somebody who's a strong swimmer that's going to be able to respond when I need them to respond.  Host: Wow.  Jim Fuderer: You know. And you bring people in. And it's, again, they give you time. If you can't pass that test, next.  Kristie Melass: Yeah.  Jim Fuderer: We'll get somebody else in to do it.  Host: And you said, you have to, you have to have annual cert. You don't have to do that whole thing over again.  Kristie Melass: Oh, no. That is a one and done thing. Unless you leave and come back. If you leave and have to go somewhere for a year. And then come back to work, you have to do it again.  Host: Make sure you're still fit.  Kristie Melass: Correct.  Host: OK.  Jim Fuderer: I was 52 when I took that test. [Laughter].  Kristie Melass: I was 39.  Host: I don't think I could do the first part. I don't think I could do the 12 laps in eight minutes. I think I'd I would fail like right off the bat.  Kristie Melass: I had a hard time with that. Because I'm -- I didn't come into this as a swimmer. You know, I've always been a diver. I have never been a swimmer.  Host: Wow.  Kristie Melass: And so, I had to really practice swimming.  Host: Yeah.  Jim Fuderer: Me too.  Kristie Melass: In order to get --  Jim Fuderer: I learned the technique. I was one of those, I could swim. But I learned the, how important it is not to be looking at the wall.  Kristie Melass: Look down. [laughter]  Jim Fuderer: But I want to look down or look at my feet.  Kristie Melass: Right.  Jim Fuderer: And swim.  Host: Yeah. Yeah, yeah.  Jim Fuderer: So, not Michael Phelps. [Laughter].  Host: Just butterfly the whole time. [Laughter]. So, so, that's an intense certification. Now, I know we talked a lot about when it comes to what you're doing, a lot of it is the spacewalk training for working on the outside of the International Space Station. I know that's not all that happens in this facility. There's a lot of other things. One that comes immediately to mind is, and this is one of the cooler ones that I've seen, is Orion Egress Training. So, this is that Orion capsule that's going to be going to the Moon. You put it in the pool. And I guess --  Jim Fuderer: I'm part of that.  Host: You're part of that?  Jim Fuderer: I'm leaving for San Diego in a week --  Host: Really?  Jim Fuderer: -- to do that, yeah. I do that.  Host: So, what's -- going into this?  Jim Fuderer: Well, it's a, it's a -- I've been there at the facility. It'll be five years. It's been an ongoing thing, I believe, probably for about ten years. Starting with a gentleman named Tim Goddard, who was initially brought in with this, ex-Navy diver. Who's done a lot of engineering. A lot of development on this, working with NASA and the engineers. And now, with the facility, there's several different boiler plates of the Orion staged around. We have one in San Diego that we're going to go work with, with the Navy. We have one in our facility that you saw.  Host: Yes.  Jim Fuderer: And we put that in the pool. And we test it. We test it with our personnel that's part of that group. And then, we bring in the Navy divers or we bring in the PJs, which are the Air Force rescue guys. And we flip it upside down. And we flip it back up. And work with them. And train them how to put the gear on. There's a stab collar. There's a porch. There's a whole lot that goes into that. And it's all been developed right there in the NBL.  Kristie Melass: And we actually create ocean like conditions in the pool with the wave balls that we've got.  Host: Oh, cool.  Kristie Melass: We can make waves that are a couple feet.  Host: Wow.  Jim Fuderer: Yeah.  Kristie Melass: Yeah.  Host: Because the idea being if you land in rough waters.  Kristie Melass: In the ocean.  Host: Here's how you deal with that.  Kristie Melass: Right.  Host: OK.  Jim Fuderer: Not so much with, believe, for that, not so much for the test subject, or the people inside the capsule. But it's for, more helpful for the guys who are actually going to be doing that work on the outside of the capsule.  Host: OK.  Jim Fuderer: You'd be amazed when you swim up next to a space capsule and you have like a three- or four-foot chop, it totally changes your dynamics of how you're assembling a lot of the equipment that you have to put on there.  Host: Is that, is that really what you're doing when you're training for this, is you're thinking about all these different scenarios and conditions?  Jim Fuderer: Absolutely.  Host: Yeah.  Jim Fuderer: Failures not an option.  Host: Failures not an option.  Jim Fuderer: Yeah.  Host: Very cool. So, that's, that's one type of other thing that can happen in the Neutral Buoyancy Laboratory. What am I missing? What else happens?  Kristie Melass: We also do some sea survival training. So, we'll have people come in and take classes on how to escape should they have to eject from an airplane, and they land in the ocean in their parachute.  Host: Oh, wow.  Kristie Melass: How do they find their way out of their parachute? How do they disconnect themselves from it? We have a winch drag that will actually drag them across the surface of the water. And they'll have to release their parachute buckles.  Host: Woah.  Kristie Melass: We'll lift that student up with the crane that simulates a helicopter. And they'll get in the basket. And just learn how to be rescued. And how to survive should that happen. And we'll get the waves going for that also. And we have got a new machine that actually is a big fan that blows high wind.  Jim Fuderer: It works pretty well, actually. [Laughter]. It does.  Kristie Melass: And we can create a little bit of rain and wind for them while they're doing that also.  Host: Wow.  Kristie Melass: So, it's pretty cool. We also test ROV's in the pool.  Host: What's that? ROV.  Jim Fuderer: Remotely Operated Vehicle. It's a robot.  Host: Oh.  Jim Fuderer: Oceaneering has one in the building. And they actually just got done doing a test. I hope I'm not giving away anything here. We had a customer come in. But they're able to have a customer come in and maybe do a test on a job before it goes offshore into an environment. Before I spend a lot of money and I find out in, you know, 1,200 feet of water that it doesn't work. I can test it in the pool.  Host: Yeah.  Kristie Melass: And they test little video rays in the pool also.  Jim Fuderer: Yeah.  Kristie Melass: So.  Host: I've seen some students over there too. They do like robotics experiment or something.  Kristie Melass: Oh, the Micro-g NeXT students.  Host: That's it.  Kristie Melass: Yeah. Different colleges will come, and they'll have competitions. They'll make certain tools that, different versions of certain tools that they'll test out in the pool. And they'll actually have, by the end of it they'll have the astronauts use their tool and see how well it works. And they'll document that. And whoever wins, actually gets to have their tool manufactured to go up and be used in space.  Jim Fuderer: They had one, didn't they? The -- he came in. It was, they had, they came up with the --  Kristie Melass: The zip tie cutter.  Jim Fuderer: Yean, the zip tie cutter for the AMS.  Host: That's right.  Jim Fuderer: Yeah. So, that was. That's killer.  Kristie Melass: Yeah.  Jim Fuderer: Yeah. That's awesome. [Laughter].  Host: That's, that was huge. That was an integral part of fixing the Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer was that cutter.  Kristie Melass: Yeah.  Jim Fuderer: And you're getting your future ready. I mean, these kids are our future.  Host: Yeah.  Jim Fuderer: I mean it's intense. Yeah.  Host: Yeah.  Jim Fuderer: Yeah.  Kristie Melass: Yeah, I got to see that happen. So, that was really cool.  Host: Yeah.  Kristie Melass: To be working as part of that team.  Host: Sounds like you both really like being NBL divers. There's a lot to it. There's a lot of diversity. There's just a lot of cool things that are happening.  Kristie Melass: It's amazing. I always said that, you know, I wouldn't be happy unless I were doing a job every day that is bigger than us. You know, you're contributing to the greater good. And exploration. And it's just so rewarding to see it actually come into fruition. To see our hard work. Especially, you know, when they do spacewalks. Sometimes we get to watch those spacewalks on the monitors on the pool deck as they're happening live.  Jim Fuderer: I saw that.  Kristie Melass: Yeah. And so, to see them doing the steps in space that you have helped them do so many times in the pool is just, it's the best feeling.  Host: I've heard sometimes, some of the astronauts when they go out on a spacewalk for the first time. One of the things they say are, where are my divers?  Kristie Melass: Yeah. [Laughter]. I've heard that too.  Host: Because they're so used to you guys, right? They're so used to working with you. Because you've been there training them on all of these skills that they're just about to do for the first time in space.  Kristie Melass: Yeah.  Host: Yeah. That's a big deal. You have a lot to contribute to, to human spaceflight. I appreciate talking to both of you today. This was a fascinating discussion.  Jim Fuderer: But we got more to talk about. You're not kicking us out yet because we've just been dealing with talking about space station. We're getting ready to make the next, we're getting ready for Artemis.  Host: Why was I about to wrap up? Tell me about that. Tell me about Artemis.  Jim Fuderer: Yeah. So, let's. So, we, we have the ability now and we've brought in. There's a group of us who have brought in surface supply commercial diving gear. And we're going to start training for walking on the Moon at the bottom of the pool.  Host: No way.  Jim Fuderer: Oh, yeah. It's there.  Kristie Melass: We have a little lunar area down there with a sand pit.  Host: Lunar area. That's cool.  Kristie Melass: Sand pit and some rocks. And we've got all kinds of stuff gearing up for that. So, it's a really exciting time to be in this job. Because --  Jim Fuderer: It is.  Host: You can do moonwalk training in the pool? And what are you training for? What is it they are exactly doing for moonwalking? Just learning how to walk. Are they picking up rocks?  Jim Fuderer: Yeah. Because. And again, it's different. It's, it's we don't have the suit yet. They're working on it. So, we are in the process of developing what we think is going to be close enough to simulate a suit that they're going to be walking on the Moon with. It's out there. We just don't have it yet. So, we brought in some, some commercial diving helmets. And we've developed a package with that. And it's a little different. It's different than swimming. Diving is not just midwater stuff. Now, you put people on the bottom of the pool. And you start walking around and that just opens up a whole different skillset. The different skillset is finding leverage on how to do tools and how to manipulate yourself. And how to walk around and get around. It's, it's --  Kristie Melass: Yeah. The gravity on the Moon is different.  Host: Yeah.  Jim Fuderer: Yeah.  Kristie Melass: So, we go from weightless training to 1/6th gravity training.  Host: Ooh yeah. That's a different technique.  Kristie Melass: So, it's a shift.  Host: Now, you have to work from pushing up that tool. Now, it's. Yeah. How do you? That's got to be difficult figuring that out how to do it. But that's a good place to train, right, to get those skills.  Jim Fuderer: Yeah.  Kristie Melass: Absolutely.  Jim Fuderer: Absolutely.  Host: Yeah. I know there's a -- you know, thinking about other things that are happening there. I know suit testing is one of those things. We just unveiled like the new Artemis spacesuit, the one that's going to be used on the Moon. And I know they tested it in the pool.  Jim Fuderer: The xEMU, yeah.  Kristie Melass: The Z-2.5.  Host: Yeah. Yeah, yeah. And just testing out the new suit's capabilities. And how it, how we're like actually getting it to a point where you're close to this is how it would feel in space. I heard great things from, I think it was Kate Rubins, who said really good things about it.  Kristie Melass: Yep.  Host: I don't know if you were there for those ones.  Kristie Melass: Yeah. I was there.  Host: Oh, you were there.  Kristie Melass: Yeah.  Host: Yeah. That's got to be cool. Testing the next generation of suits. And see a series of moonwalk, moonwalks. You're doing moonwalks in the pool.  Jim Fuderer: Well, we're going to try help also supplement with, with [NASA Extreme Environment Mission Operation] NEEMO. So.  Host: OK. That's, that's --  Jim Fuderer: With our training. That's the underwater facility where they go, and they simulate. Well, they go into a shallow sat. And they simulate working in a restricted environment like that. Yeah.  Host: Yeah. It's like a habitat off the coast of Florida at the bottom of the sea.  Jim Fuderer: Yeah. It's a 60-foot habitat. And it's an air sat. Yeah.  Host: Yeah. Alright. Am I missing anything? I feel like I've skipped. You're like, no, don't wrap up yet. You got to talk about, you got to talk about moonwalking. How did I miss that one? [Laughter]. That's pretty cool. Well, yeah, no, this was really, a really fun conversation. Thank you for coming and talking about the Neutral Buoyancy Lab.  Kristie Melass: Thank you so much for having us.  Jim Fuderer: Yeah. This was cool.  Host: Yeah.  Kristie Melass: Thanks.  Jim Fuderer: Thanks.  [ Music] Host: Hey, thanks for sticking around.

                        "description": "Gary Jordan (Host): Houston, we have a podcast. Welcome to the official podcast of the NASA Johnson Space Center, Episode 148, “Space Station in 360 VR.” I'm Gary Jordan, and I'll be your host today. On this podcast, we bring in the experts, scientists, engineers, astronauts, all to let you know what's going on in the world of human spaceflight. We're coming up on 20 years of continuous human presence on the International Space Station, an orbiting platform that has provided countless insights into living and working in space. It's brought us more of an understanding about the universe, about the effects of gravity, and about the benefits that research can bring to all of humankind. The International Space Station has taught us what humans are truly capable of and inspired so many more to pursue great things. And how people are inspired has come in many different forms. I'm sure a lot of us can name a movie or a book that inspired our love of spaceflight. Those who were lucky enough to grow up during the Apollo program may have been inspired watching history unfold live. Many remember watching or rather feeling their first launch and were inspired to take part in it. I get a chance to talk to astronauts a lot on this podcast. Sometimes they're flown astronauts, and I always get a sense of their perspective from space. What is it like? How are they feeling when they look down on Earth? They talk about pictures and how it really doesn't do justice to the true experience. But that might change soon. Part of NASA's charter is to educate and inform audiences about space station life and research. A new initiative called the ISS Experience brought a specially engineered virtual reality camera onboard the International Space Station to transport audiences inside the laboratory. I've seen a small clip of it. It's wild, like you're actually in the space station. And you have a better sense of the scale of things and where things are way more than just looking at photos. So, coming on the podcast today is Felix Lajeunesse and Paul Raphael, co-founders and creative directors of Felix & Paul Studios and the ISS Experience VR film. They discuss the journey of making this film from designing the camera and operating on space station to working with TIME magazine, astronauts, and NASA, and what it takes to put it all together. So, here we go, the International Space Station in Virtual Reality with Felix and Paul. Enjoy.  [ Music]  Host: Felix and Paul, thanks for coming on the podcast today.  Felix Lajeunesse: Thank you.   Paul Raphael: Thanks for having us.  Host: Alright, this is a very interesting topic for this ISS Experience, a brand-new way of showing the International Space Station. Even just before this, I got a chance to look at the VR clip that you guys have put together. It's like you're there. So, I'm excited to see how this came about, starting with a little bit of background about you guys. Felix, we'll start with you. What's your background? And how did you get into the world of VR?  Felix Lajeunesse: So, I'm a director. So, I come from a traditional directing background. So, I directed documentaries and fiction, commercials, and music videos. I eventually met with Paul, and we started doing work together, co directing commercials and films, and we realized that we wanted to gradually move away from traditional practice of cinema and explore immersive installations, immersive cinematic installation, so we started to implement in our work holography and 3D stereoscopy cinema and projection mapping and live actors inside of the cinematic installations that we were creating, trying to move away from the paradigm of the screen and enter into the world of full immersion. And that was a process that we were on that was sort of a journey that we were on for a couple of years. And that eventually led us to virtual reality. So, it's been a real kind of transgression from traditional cinema to fully immersive cinematic virtual reality.  Host: So, Paul, what attracted you about the, this immersive experience versus what you had historically done, just working with stuff that you would see on a typical screen?  Paul Raphael: I think it was, I mean, I've always been interested by what technology, how technology can enable new forms of storytelling, new forms of art, for one thing. The other really was about, you know, whenever I experienced something, it was a very different thing than being told a story. And you can, you can certainly feel emotions, and being told a story is an experience in and of itself. And I mean that as much as an oral telling of a story or a film or anything that is more showing you something rather than putting you in it. But being a part of an experience kind of opens up certain valves in your head that are, you just can't, you just can't open those in any other way. And I think that's one of the things that really drew me in, and I think Felix as well, into the immersive realm. It's, OK, well, we can make people feel things that they've never felt before by making the stories we tell immersive. And that's been, you know, a big, a big reason in why we've been exploring this for the past few years.  Felix Lajeunesse: It's like in real life, we are used at the concept of presence, right? We are present in real life, and so we feel the world through our consciousness, we feel it through our senses and through the impression that we have that we exist in this world. Right? And so, we are very sensitive to physical reality as human beings. And when you watch a film, generally you switch to spectator mode. You know? So, you shut down a lot of those valves that Paul talked about, and you enter in a mode of receiving something. You're no longer in this kind of interaction with the world. You're no longer feeling the world around you. You're watching something that's separated from you. It's like --  Host: It's almost passive, like you're just, you're just kind of, it's a one-way communication. You're not, you're not, you don't want to explore, you don't want to look around.  Felix Lajeunesse: Exactly.  Host: Yeah.  Felix Lajeunesse: There is, there is that. And you can tell extraordinary stories through that. You know? Passivity is not necessarily a bad thing. But it's something, we wanted to kind of explore beyond that and try to see, can we recreate through a media experience something that feels like the experience of the physical world? Can we sort of trigger inside of audiences the same kind of response and sensitivity and awareness and all of the things that make reality, the experience of reality what it is, can we actually replicate that inside of a media experience? And that was sort of the quest that we were on. That's what led us to, you know, virtual reality. And it's a quest that continues today, because virtual reality is not a finite medium. It's an evolving technology. And so, we continue our exploration to push that further and further.  Paul Raphael: And, you know, I'd also say that, you know, virtual and augmented reality, or any form of immersive medium, really feels like what all mediums have tried to be, you know, but they just couldn't be that before. You know? We started with cave paintings and oral stories and eventually, you know, photography and film and all sorts of I mean, certain, obviously I'm not saying it is the best medium and trumps everything else. But certainly, you know, when you think about our experience as humans, like as Felix said, it isn't full immersion, it is volumetric, it is in all directions. Every other form of storytelling is an abstracted form, you know, for us. And that's really interesting in and of itself, that there's things you can do through abstraction that you can't do through, you know, something that looks, that is more life-like in its representation. But it feels like after, you know, hundreds, if not, you know, thousands or millions of years, we finally have a way to tell stories in a way that really emulates reality. And then you can also take that beyond reality. But at least the baseline is a lot less alien than watching a flat rectangular image, or, you know, that is really a very alien thing. We're so used to it, and it seems like the normal thing, and that VR is this exotic thing.  Host: Yeah.  Paul Raphael: But to me, it's more like we've kind of come full circle and can finally use, you know, a medium that more corresponds to the way we experience reality.  Host: So, experience reality. You're trying to tell a story through this immersive filmmaking, the way that you're telling the story, and the way that you have to approach this has to be different than traditional filmmaking. What are some of those differences?  Felix Lajeunesse: Yeah, well, if you try to tell a story traditionally through virtual reality, what might happen is you might hinder the sense of presence and the sense of immersion. If you care more about the story construction and the efficiency of the storytelling from an, in terms of pacing, you know, compared to what you could watch on television, for example, compared to what you could watch on mainstream cinema, if you start to apply those principles, then what will happen is you will not nurture at all this sense of immersion and this sense of presence for audiences. And it will not make the medium bloom into, you know, and the experience bloom and become what it should be. So, it's kind of a balancing act between trying to create sufficient space in sufficient time in each of the shots for audiences to truly find their footing, feel immersed, connect to the protagonists, or the characters, connect to the environment, discover, you know, their own place inside of that environment. So, that is a process of immersion, and it requires time, and it requires a certain set of spatial configurations. Let's call it this way. And then the storytelling, very often what we do is we try to do it in a very kind of soft way. So, sometimes we will rely on voiceover narrations to kind of transport the viewer into the story without disrupting its immersion into the moment. Do you see what I mean? And we will try to, you know, navigate very slowly from one scene to another scene. And so, it's a form of quiet storytelling in a way where you are definitely telling a story, but you're doing it not in a loud way that prevents the viewer from feeling that state of immersion.  Host: Yeah, it's different from the traditional storytelling where you're trying to, you have a rigid storyline and you want people to follow that, and there's a sense of focus. But it sounds like this is more of like a gentle guide through, through an immersive experience.  Felix Lajeunesse: You could say that, yes. And, you know, and if you watch a project like “Space Explorers” that we did, you know, no one explains that there's not a story. There is a story. You are following the journey of these astronauts. It's very compelling. But the way we're doing it, it's not by, you know, sort of taking the hand of the viewer and telling them how to think and telling them how to experience each moment and where they should look and how they should feel. We're not directive with them. We're giving them a lot of space to actually process what they're watching and feel, complement what they're watching with their own thoughts, with their own imagination, with their own sensitivity. And that's, that's how it works in the real world. You know? And that's how human interactions work. So, we're kind of trying to replicate that, bring some of that in our experiences, in our, and they're a still narrative, you know, they still tell a story, but they just do it in a way that is more subtle.  Host: So, this is obviously something that's you're very passionate about, you're very interested in telling stories this way, so you both created Felix & Paul Studios. Tell me about the genesis of that, how that came about.  Paul Raphael: Well, it really started when we tried the first Oculus prototype. I mean, we've been, we had already been exploring the immersive storytelling, as Felix mentioned. In fact, what we were doing around that time was very similar to virtual reality, even though it wasn't with a headset. We were using 3D projection, you know, the same thing you do in a 3D movie, but we were using it in more of an installation format where we controlled all the variables of the viewing setup. So, the size of the screen, the distance from which the viewer was watching the screen, you know, it was a sweet spot, these were installations more than films. And really, they were kind of like narrow field of view VR, because you can look behind you, although I suppose we could have surrounded the viewer with screens and created something even closer to virtual reality. But this is what we were really exploring. And then dropped the Oculus Kickstarter. And the day we tried that, and if it wasn't the day, it was within a matter of days, it became clear to us that if we could find a way to adapt the technology we had developed for our installations into, for the virtual reality format, this would probably be a complete game changer, not just for ourselves, but for, for storytelling in general. It's worth mentioning that when the Oculus, when Oculus, you know, was selling the idea of virtual reality, their focus was really at the time on video games. And I don't think they were narrow, that narrow minded that they thought that that's all virtual reality was going to be for. But at the time, that was kind of their initial target. They're like, you know, gamers are the most likely people to buy this at this point. And then, you know, probably people on the periphery, training, and, you know, all sorts of industrial applications, education, things like that. But, you know, we took this, this developer's kit, we adapted the technology we had developed, and little by little within a matter of months, we got to, you know, a first demo of a virtual reality, a filmed virtual reality experience. And we started showing it around, and people were just completely blown away, as we were when we did it, and we were just incredibly excited. We started showing it everywhere. And eventually to Oculus themselves. And they had never seen anything like it. And that kind of triggered a very tight partnership with them, and really the genesis of the studio as we were able to build our team up, raise some funding, further advance the technology, and the technology is, you know, it was, it was hardware, it was software, it was process, post production process. And, of course, creative development of a brand-new language, which is telling stories in full, in virtual reality.  Felix Lajeunesse: Yeah, and maybe to add that we didn't come, it was not the start of an exploration, it was an exploration that had started many years before that, prior to that. So, we had been doing a couple of years of immersive cinematic installations, as we mentioned earlier, and so when we created our first virtual reality experience, we approached it with a set of hypothesis from a creative standpoint as to what we wanted to achieve, what we wanted to investigate.  Host: Because it's so new.  Felix Lajeunesse: Because it's so new. And the one thing that we felt this medium would be extraordinary for is a sense, creating a sense of human connection, to just be with someone who is there at the real scale in a space with you, tricking your mind into actually thinking that that person is not beyond a screen, that person is sharing a space with you, and how that will make you react as an audience, how that will trigger something inside of you that's very visceral, that's very profound, you know? And the first experience that we ever created was just a one on one with a musician. So, he is sitting behind his piano, and he's not performing, he's just writing music, and so it's a real scene. It was unscripted. We came in the studio. We placed the camera as if the camera was a friend visiting the artist. So, we placed it at a comfortable intimate distance from him, not too invasive, not too far, where a friend would sit. You know? And then we just filmed what happened. And we preserved these six minutes. We kept a continuous six-minute shot. And it's just him goofing around, playing piano. He smokes a cigarette. He takes the phone at some point. He talks to his wife. And it's just a moment in his life. But six minutes of this is not enough. You're in it with him, and you're feeling this, it's so real, he's so there, you're so there, like there's something going on in that moment that is really powerful, and, from a human standpoint. And so that was kind of the foundation, the first exploration that we did in virtual reality, and it worked out really well. And that was before we started asking the question of how we will articulate a narrative. It was just about getting to the fundamentals of what this medium can provide in terms of an emotional experience.  Host: Yeah, you saw, you saw the power that, of immersing yourself in just a moment, but you realize that to really, that that wasn't enough time maybe to immerse. So, to fully tell the story, we're talking about a longer period of time for you to really get into it.  Felix Lajeunesse: Yeah. And so, it's like building block. It's like any new medium that you want to play with, it's like a building block. You will learn something and something else and you will start, you know, constructing something more complex with time.  Host: So, tell me about when the idea of telling a story about space, your interest in space, tell me when that started coming along.  Felix Lajeunesse: So, I think that it's one of those things that from the get go when we started to play with virtual reality and became more and more enthralled with the medium and the possibilities of the medium, one of the early conversations we had was we need to do this in space. We need to actually recreate our sort of leverage, this immersive power of the medium, to transport audiences in the environment of space and make them feel that. And this is something that we wanted to experience personally. But we thought that this medium would be just a perfect marriage with space exploration. It feels, to us, and it felt to us at the beginning that space is something that you want to experience. You can talk about, you know, the journey of space exploration. You can say a lot of things about that. But you will always feel as a viewer, that it's happening in another reality in a way. And so if we can sort of bridge that gap and bring audiences at the heart of this journey and make them feel like they are a part of it and make them feel like they can really, you know, not just look around, but feel like they are an astronaut to a certain extent, you know, and have more of a physical connection with that world, we felt that that was something we had to do as a studio and as artists from the get go. It took us a couple of years to get there. But we set out that goal from the very, very beginning of Felix & Paul Studios.  Host: Yeah. Well, tell me about that journey, where you said this is something that we have to do, this is a story we absolutely have to tell, and then eventually getting to the point where you're starting to tell these stories with the “Space Explorers” series?  Felix Lajeunesse: So, one thing led to another in this journey. So, after we created the first experience that we talked about, which was called “Strangers,” which was this intimate one on one experience with a musician called Patrick Watson, we then met with Steven Spielberg's team in Hollywood, and Colin Trevorrow, the director of “Jurassic World,” told us, “hey, I love this experience. So, what you did with Patrick Watson, this musician, can you do inside of the world of Jurassic World with a dinosaur,” which was an extraordinary brief, and so we did that, so we created that piece, we did a project with Fox Searchlight, with Reese Witherspoon and Laura Dern, which was our first fiction piece. And we also explored interactivity inside of that piece, gaze triggered interactivity. Depending on where you look, certain events will happen or not in the unfolding of the story. So, all of these early experiences were very short. They were below four minutes. But we were exploring different ways to articulate a story within immersion. And eventually we started collaborating with “Cirque du Soleil.” So, we created an adaptation in virtual reality of some of their shows. So, we're not talking about film an existing show. We're talking about restaging the show completely for virtual reality, for a one-person audience, and trying to scale a big spectacle down to an experience that will feel very intimate, that will make you feel like you're one of the protagonists of this piece. And that eventually led us to work with President Obama. So, we got contacted by the White House because they were interested in outreach and finding new ways to communicate with younger audiences, and they were interested in that medium. So, we created two projects with the Obama administration. One was a tour of Yosemite National Park for the National Park Centennial, and the second project that we did was a virtual reality tour of the White House, guided and narrated by Barack and Michelle Obama. So, we did this. We also did a project with President Clinton. And so, you know, one thing leads you to another. And the project started to grow in duration. So, they were very short at the beginning. Very often, it was just one shot when we started. One project was one shot of three minutes, or six minutes, eventually started to get more and more elaborate and complex. And so, the format that we landed with was about 20 minutes, more or less, for our productions. And eventually we felt that we had all of the learnings, and from a creative standpoint and from a technology standpoint, to go out and approach NASA and say, “hey, we now want to tell the story of space exploration through virtual reality. Here's what we've done, you know, and here's what we want to do next.” So, we approached NASA initially with that desire to do this when we felt ready to do this.  Host: Wow, that's quite a journey with a lot of very recognizable names, for sure. So, moving on from there, you approach NASA, you say, I want to do this. Now, I'm sure from there, it was quite a process to just get your foot in the door. And now we're having the challenge of telling a story about space. Now, I know some of the story that you tell through the “Space Explorer” series is something here on the ground. So, that's a little bit more tangible. But I know that your goal was to send a virtual reality, a 360-degree camera to space.  Felix Lajeunesse: Yeah, I mean, so, the first thing we did when we started to, you know, visit JSC and meet different NASA executives and different people that we had to basically convince that this was worth everybody's time, was showing them the work that we had done already. And just that spoke in itself expressed a lot. And you could, you could extrapolate from that and think about, you know, how will space exploration translate through this medium? It was kind of relatively easy to make that, that projection, that translation from the work that existed that we had done to what we wanted to create. And then something that happened that was very important is that we started to meet with astronauts, and they became excited, and they wanted to be a part of it. And so, and that was a game changer. That was when things started to really accelerate, and we found real momentum within NASA to go out and do these filmings and do these recordings. And then one thing leads to another. When we started to process the shots, even before the final product, we started to show it to some folks, and people got very excited about what we were doing. And then when we finished Episode 1 of “Space Explorers,” which was launched at the Sundance Film Festival in 2018, then we came back here, and we showed it to everybody. And so, we went from department to department to show the 20-minute episode. And then we really started to build, I think, support for the medium and the pertinence of using this, this medium to tell the story about space exploration. And then more astronauts saw it and more NASA executives saw it. And eventually we became people that were no longer, you know, the newcomers with the new medium, but we were, you know, part of the family to a certain extent.  Host: Integrated. Wonderful.  Felix Lajeunesse: Integrated, yeah.  Host: So, you know, this is, part of the family you want to tell these stories, what are you trying to tell with “Space Explorers?” What was, what was the immersive experience for those that may have not heard of the series?  Felix Lajeunesse: Well, I think that, you know, “Space Explorers” is humanity's journey. It's a journey that's about everybody. And it might sound like a cliché to say this, but it is true. All the discoveries that we're making in space are ultimately about understanding who we are as a species, you know, better understanding the biosphere, better understanding our place in the universe and where we're headed. And I think that that's a very profound and important quest. And it's really about everyone on this planet. And so, we felt that, you know, only just a few people get to go to space, a few hundred people have visited space. But we felt that their journey truly matters, and that it's important to broaden the access to that journey to as large an audience as possible through that medium. And so we've been interested from the get go to the full story arc of the astronaut's journey, from how they train here on Earth, you know, how they get to learn the fundamentals of what it is to be an astronaut, how they learn to fly, and then their missions on the ISS, how they adapt to the environment of space station, how do they do all of the science, the work, how do they experience the overview effect, how do they live the human collaboration of being with astronauts from all those different national space programs all around the world? How do they prepare for a spacewalk? And then documenting the spacewalk and the post EVA. And so and sharing with them thoughts and regards to the future of human spaceflight and the next step. So, every step of the way, it's a very exciting journey, but it's a journey that I think everybody can feel involved into, because ultimately the purpose of that journey is about everybody. So, it's a story that we feel has a real universal appeal.  Paul Raphael: You know, something that I think of it like we're at this incredibly rare moment where humanity is almost in a state of metamorphosis. Right? Like if you think back at when, you know, there were no ground-based creatures, and everyone lived underwater, and then at some point some creatures made it out there, and, you know, there was no way to record that. In fact, the only recording of that is DNA and fossils and biology. And that's the record of that.  Host: Yeah.  Paul Raphael: And now we're making our first steps, even though it started over 50 years ago, there is kind of an acceleration right now in humans becoming, you know, extraterrestrials, you know, basically it's almost inevitable, unless we destroy ourselves before we get there, that humans become interplanet, an interplanetary species. So, that seems to me like one of the most important and fascinating things you could possibly document today. And to get a glimpse as an earthling of what it is to take those first steps off of the planet, I mean, how amazing is that, you know?  Host: Yeah. And, you know, just from the clip I've seen of the just in space, the one with David Saint-Jacques was the one I'm thinking about right now. But he just looks so comfortable in that environment. And you talk about a metamorphosis. It's, you know, you're transported to this moment, but it's like, you can see there is an established life there that he's very comfortable. And to be a part of that is, that's an experience in and of itself. I want to talk about how we got to that point, how we got the camera up to space, what it took to make that happen, to tell this story, to get people to immerse in this particular location has its own difficulties. So, what were those challenges? And how did that happen?  Paul Raphael: Well, you know, we built the first VR camera now six or seven years ago. And since then, we've been iterating on that design, and we've built four, we're at the fourth generation of our land-based camera, and we've built countless variations and special purpose cameras for shooting in different situations here on Earth, or underwater, or in the air. For this particular project, we kind of had to take a step back and look at not sending one of our own cameras, because they're so custom designed, and they're not [Federal Communications Commission] FCC-certified, and all, you know, at the time that we had to get a camera up there and with all the requirements, we decided let's look at all the cameras that are out there, let's pick the one we think best suits what we're trying to do, and let's, knowing what we know about virtual reality cameras, both on the hardware, software, processing and playback, how do we make that camera do things it could never do before, right? So, we started with a preexisting camera. In this case, it's a Z CAM V1 Pro. And we, first of all, modified it to, for to, adhere to the specifications of being sent to the International Space Station. And we modified it and upgraded it in ways that allowed it to do things it couldn't do before. And, yeah, that's basically how we, how we got there.  Host: What are some of those specifications and modifications that made it a space worthy camera?  Paul Raphael: So, one of the things that was always very important for us, just the virtual reality in general, is proximity. Right? And that's the hardest thing to do with a VR camera, because you're essentially, when you're shooting in VR, you're trying to do two things that are fundamentally incompatible. You're trying to shoot in 360 degrees without any distortion, which is usually done shooting with a nodal rig. You could put a single camera on a nodal rig, spin it around with, you know, from a single point, and then you stitch all this together. And the closer you are to the lens's nodal point, which is basically where all the rays of light converge, the less distortion you have when you get, when you take all these different pictures and put them back together. On the other hand, when you're shooting a VR, you want stereoscopy, you want 3D images, you want to be able to see a different image from each eye. So, you need to shoot two different images that are approximately 65 millimeters apart. So, between one requirement being all the images need to be shot from a single point that's as small as possible, or the other requirement being they all have to be 6.5 millimeters apart, this is, this is kind of, you know, it's impossible.  Host: Yeah, yeah.  Paul Raphael: Unless you do, unless you find the right way to bend light, so to speak, it's just a fundamentally incompatible equation. So, our cameras have always been designed with that, you know, how do you, how do you best cheat that with, you know, with the express intention of being able to shoot objects that are closest? Why objects that are closest? Well, VR is a medium of intimacy and presence. You know, the closer something is, without being too close, the more you can feel that thing or that person's presence. Most cameras that are designed are designed as general-purpose cameras, and they want to make them as easy to use as possible. And, you know, for as many people to just grab and go. So, they're actually, you know, they're not optimized for any specific thing. Whereas our cameras have always been really focused on proximity. But if you can get proximity, you can also get distance. Right?  Host: Yeah.  Paul Raphael: So, one of the things we had to do, starting with the Z CAM, is kind of make up for the fact that it isn't expressly designed to shoot things in close proximity. When we're shooting in a space that is extremely small, I mean, there is no angle in the ISS that isn't in proximity. And not only that, we wouldn't be up there to have complete control, and even if we were, we wouldn't always have the freedom to put the camera anywhere we want, you know, we have all sorts of restrictions on where and how a camera can be placed for any given shot. And so, we knew we would probably end up with things that would be way closer to the camera than we would even do with our own cameras here on Earth to, you know, to facilitate post production and to keep things comfortable. Right? So, we had to, you know, find ways to make up for, for that. And one of the ways we do that is we created a motorized base for the camera to rotate and kind of capture a, what we would call a slit-scan of a scene. So, what, you know, even though the Z CAM has eight lateral cameras and one to get the top or the Zenit, by spinning the camera, we get the equivalent of an infinite amount of cameras. For a still frame, right? And that gives us kind of a baseline, a calibration of the actual geometry of a space. And then we only have to deal, we only have to make sure that the astronauts don't get too close to the camera, because then we know how the good, you know, kind of a perfect image everywhere else. Right? So, that's just one of the ways that we do that. The other way is, you know, even though we're shooting with a camera that isn't, wasn't designed at the studio from scratch, we did adapt our customized software and pipeline that we did build from scratch for that camera. So, all the benefits from the software and post production side are now applied to this camera as well. So, these are just a couple examples on how we took an external camera and kind of made it our own.  Host: A couple examples, but that was, that's a tremendous amount of work. It really is. I mean, this is, you're designing this camera for a very, very specific need. And I'm sure, you know, you're talking about requirements for the filming requirements too. But there's also the fact that it's going to space. There's also the fact that this thing has to launch on a vehicle with intense vibrations. So, designing a camera like that has a significant amount of challenges. And I'm sure you put a ton of work and a ton of thought and a lot of intricate design into this camera. But eventually you've got to package it up and you've got to put it on a launch vehicle and you've got to see this thing go up into space. Did you see it launch into space? Did you see the camera? Were you there for it?  Paul Raphael: Absolutely. Well, we were watching, you know, we were watching the live broadcasts.  Host: OK.  Paul Raphael: You know, along with hundreds of thousands, if not millions of people, but it was definitely an amazing emotional moment. We did pop some champagne that day.  Host: Well deserved. There's a lot of work that went into that.  Paul Raphael: Absolutely.  Host: Yeah. Alright, so, tell me about what it takes to actually, you talked about the intricate design that it takes to think about ahead of time what goes into this camera. Tell me about actually filming, the operations, what is it like to work with the astronauts, to work with the footage? That has to be a tremendous amount of footage that you're, that you're getting. And not only a tremendous amount, but just like it's coming in, yes, large I guess quantities, but the files themselves have to be enormous. So, working with all of that on a day to day basis, maybe not day to day, but very often with the astronauts.  Paul Raphael: Mhmm. So, this is a three-part question.  Host: A lot of questions, yeah, yeah, yeah. I guess what it takes to work, I guess if you're filming on a day, take me through, take me through a day where you want to film with the astronauts and it's time to set up a camera and start that work, what's that like?  Felix Lajeunesse: Yeah, so generally what we do is we identify ahead of time what we're going to film. So, whether it's an interview, what we call an astronaut log, or whether it's science that we're going to film, or some operations, satellite launch, or something else, so we know ahead of time, sometimes two weeks, three weeks ahead of time what's going to happen. And then in which module it's going to happen. And then more or less where inside of that module it's going to happen. And so, from there, we sort of run a topology study. We imagine or envision where the camera could be based on preexisting studies that we have made before. And sometimes we make adjustments to that. And we say, no, we want it in that access or in that orientation. And then we produce documents that are submitted to NASA. And then eventually it gets approved. And then on the day, it turns into documents of operation that the astronauts can actually read on the day and say, oh, OK, well, this is where they want a camera. Great, OK. Oh, it's in the way of this. What about if I put it there? And so, there's always some adjustments. But that's the general flow of operation. It is done with some pre-planning. There are other types of shots that we call crew autonomy, where we're basically deferring to the crew to decide where the camera will go, especially when we're capturing certain scenes that are more private, for a certain extent, where they will be doing like some interactions between each other, like a crew meal, for example, or something like that. So, they will sometimes place the camera on their own. So, it's a, it's one approach or the other. But generally, I would say that things are very well planned ahead of time. And, yeah, and on the day of the operation, our team is there to support everything that is happening. And so, we can validate the camera placement, make sure that technically everything is fine. We're working with NanoRacks to do that. So, they are like our sort of intermediary. And then once everything is ready, then we start to roll. And then, you know, we are waiting a couple of weeks after that to see the final result, because everything is shipped to us through the form of low-resolution proxy files. So, think of it as an unfolded sphere in a way, just like when you open those books as a child and see an unfolded world map. So, that's kind of what we review as offline footage. And then we make selections. And we will send back to space station an [edit decision list] EDL time code to basically say, OK, we would request high resolution files for that time code, that time code, that time code. And then we will download that. So, it's a process that helps us not asking for too much bandwidth from space to ground. And so that's, that's the kind of workflow.  Host: OK, yeah, you're basically scanning for what you want, and then they send that’s where the massive amount of data comes through, because you're just, you're trying to pick your moment. Because you know, it sounds like everything is thought about ahead of time. So, you know about your shots a few weeks in advance. But ultimately, you're trying to package this into a story.  Felix Lajeunesse: Right.  Host: Right? You want to, you want to say something. You want people to experience something when they're there. And what is that something for filming on the International Space Station? What is that something that you're trying to tell?  Felix Lajeunesse: So, there are a few things. First of all, the story follows the dramatic arcs of the astronauts. So, for example, we document our mission from the moment that they arrive on station, and then their process of adaptation to life in space. And then getting to be part of the family of astronauts. And then the work that they do on station, but also their perspective in regards to their work, and the meaning of what they do, their relation to planet Earth, the future of human spaceflight. And so, and eventually the departure back to Earth. So, these are the dramatic arcs that we follow with multiple astronauts over the course of a year. And then through those dramatic arcs in that sort of, let's call it the network of characters, right, we are exploring different themes through that. So, we want to learn about the adaptation of life in space of the astronauts. We want to know more about all the different science investigations that are happening on station. We want to know how it's like to run a space station, which is this giant flying machine. So, what it takes to actually run this. We want to understand better the relationship to planet Earth, you know, the overview effect and all that. And so, there are different ways to explore that question. But we are making space for that in our story. We want to better understand the nature of the international collaboration and the way it plays out out there in space. And ultimately, we want to also really document everything around the spacewalks, from the way they get sort of prepared, all the steps of preparation that lead to spacewalk, and then taking the viewer outside and following the astronauts during a full spacewalk from egress to ingress, which is something that we will film later this year.  Host: Oh, that's exciting.  Felix Lajeunesse: So, it's a combination of those story arcs that we're following and those themes that we're exploring basically.  Host: Wow. Now, you know, we talked about all the work that it really took to get to that point where you're filming and you're thinking about these stories and it's a story you want to tell. Tell me about when, you know, you were first hooking up that camera and you got those first 360 images, 360 video from space looking at that. How – what were you thinking that you were expecting? And then what, you know, how did it actually turn out to be?  Felix Lajeunesse: Man, we were excited. It was very phenomenal. The first filming day that we did was with David Saint-Jacques in January 2019. Everything about that moment felt extremely stressful. It was the first time that we were testing the whole production pipeline.  Host: Yeah.  Felix Lajeunesse: The first time that we saw an astronaut manipulating the camera, putting it in place, starting the recording, all of that, every step of that felt extraordinarily precious. And then downloading the data, getting the data in the cam, being able to review it, all of that was like a miracle in a way. And once we processed the data and watched it in virtual reality, we were blown away, just like the audience that watches this for the first time. We were there. Even though we had been working for a long time to prepare this, we had never had that experience of being on the space station through virtual reality and experiencing microgravity and having an interaction in a way with a human being that is in front of you, but that is floating and that is changing orientation as they talk to you, and this shock of being with someone in the microgravity environment through virtual reality. You feel it, you know? Maybe not as strongly as you would feel if you were there with your real buddy, you know, but you still feel it. And so, we got all of those emotions. We got all of those, you know, it was a completely new phenomenon for us as well. And so, it was a very emotional beginning of production, I would say.  Host: Yeah. Now, you know, you're working with this footage to put it together. You're looking at it. Tell me, tell me what it's like to actually work with the footage, for those that might not know about what it takes to put a VR experience together. The, you know, the stitching and the editing and working with the files and processing, rendering, that sort of thing. And then from there what we can ultimately expect in terms of a finished product and where to go get it.  Paul Raphael: Well, you know, this was the first time we were working with a camera that wasn't our own fundamentally.  Host: Sure.  Paul Raphael: So, there was that hurdle of, and that worry of, you know, all the, we had done tests on Earth. But, you know, as much as you want to test for the unpredictable, it's kind of impossible to test for the unpredictable. And so, we were getting the footage and we were, you know, the cameras were always a little closer than we would have liked to a wall or cables were protruding and all over the place. And, you know, luckily, like what I mentioned earlier, the slit-scan technique that allowed us to get kind of a perfect geometry of the scene for at least everything that was static, combined with, you know, adapting our tools to be able to work with footage that was not as optimal, at least geometrically, as we were used to. It all worked out. It took a bit of adaptation. And at some point, we kind of got a little worried at how much time it would take us to process the footage, both in terms of the manual labor and the automated processes, because the data was much higher, it was much high resolution than we had worked with in the past, which is, that's a great side effect, but came with, came with its downsides. You know, ultimately, though, the results that are coming out are very similar to what we're used to getting, which is incredible, because we're in such an uncontrollable environment that's so remote and that comes with so many restrictions and hoops, you know, that you kind of have to jump through to get anything, you know, and I'm not saying that as a criticism on anything, but it's just the reality of such a sensitive environment. You know? But, yeah, we're, we're, it's all working --  Host: A lot of work, but, but it's, and it has its challenges, but it's coming together. So, what can we expect? Where, what's the finished product, and where is it going to be available? How will it be distributed?  Felix Lajeunesse: So, we're producing actually many different outputs out of this. So, on one hand, we are creating a cinematic virtual reality, four timed 25-minute episodes. And that's going to launch on all virtual reality platforms across the world. We're also producing a traditional 2D 16 by 9 version of this. So, we're looking at a 60-minute television format. Because we're filming at such a high resolution that it actually allows us in post-production to animate a camera. And the final result looks like you had a very skilled cameraman, you know, in space, filming the astronauts, and never missing anything. And so --   Paul Raphael: You're basically animating a camera with as much control as you would have in a Pixar film, or, you know, a CG film where you can totally animate the camera with perfect control, which is better than any astronaut could do if they had like the best cinema camera in the world with them.  Host: Yeah, because then you're trusting the camera operator that you're trusting.  Paul Raphael: Yeah, and they don't have time. I mean, instead of one astronaut setting up his camera and then doing what he's got to do, he or she's got to do, they just put the camera down. And we are, we can direct, we can do the cinematography in post, and eventually in real time, but that's for later in the conversation. And it's, it's kind of amazing. It's like we weren't even expecting that when we first started this project. And we kind of stumbled onto that realization and were like, wow, we not only have the most immersive footage ever shot in space. We may have some of the most trippy and immersive two-dimensional footage, and that's where this started becoming a project that we're now in discussions with some of the major networks and streamers about distributing to a much wider audience. And I think somehow many of the qualities of the full VR experience get, get ported over through this Zero-G cinematography that can only be enabled from a 360-degree image.  Felix Lajeunesse: And then so that is for the at home distribution. And then out of home, we are also producing a version of the ISS Experience for domes and planetariums. So, for large scale events where you can bring thousands of people to have a communal experience projected inside of those very large circular spherical screens. And we're also creating a large-scale traveling exhibition in partnership with TIME and a company in Canada called Phi Centre. And that large-scale traveling exhibition is going to tour the world and it's going to feature the virtual reality content that we have captured in space.  Host: Wow. Yeah, so, this is going to hit every, every channel you can think of. That's incredible.  Paul Raphael: You won't be able to avoid it.  Host: That's the hope, right? Alright, so tell me about, let's end with your, with your ambitions. You know, you talked about what's coming up is filming a spacewalk. That's very exciting. And I know you have even ambitions beyond that to tell the story about space exploration.  Felix Lajeunesse: Yeah, I mean, we want to make virtual reality the default way to document space exploration moving forward. We think that everything that was created so far demonstrate that it's a perfect medium to be part of this journey. And we want to continue to document the advancements and the next steps in human spaceflight through virtual reality. So, we're looking forward to the upcoming missions. The Moon mission obviously is an important next step for mankind. And then Mars and beyond. And we want to be a part of this every step of the way.  Host: Wow. Yeah. And you can, you already talked about the value from even the 2D perspective, being able to just mount a camera and leave it there, but not miss a moment.  Paul Raphael: Exactly.  Host: And have that and have that freedom to kind of look wherever you want.  Paul Raphael: Yeah, I mean, if that's, if that's a useful thing to have on the ISS, just imagine on the Moon, you know, where you can literally just plant a camera, a VR camera on a tripod. Not only are you putting humanity on the Moon, but you can now film any shot without any input from the astronauts. You could get multiple shots from a single point perspective. You could get both a shot and a reverse shot at the same time. You can animate the camera remotely in real time. I mean, it's kind of a super camera. You know? And we're thinking, you know, yes, they're definitely going to have normal cameras --  Host: Sure.  Paul Raphael: --up there. But we think that putting a camera, a VR camera up there wouldn't just be a bonus. I think it could be a fundamentally upgraded experience on many, many levels.  Host: See, what I've really enjoyed talking to both of you today is really just the whole breadth of what this project is. It's a, it's a completely different way of telling a story. It's immersing. It's this way of getting people to experience what it's like to be on the International Space Station. But, and, again, I've seen, I've seen this myself. I've put on the goggles and I've looked around. And I've even had a chance to look at astronauts put it on and take it off and be like, “yeah, that's it, that's the space station, that's what it looks like.” And so, it's something that you can't, you can't replicate otherwise. So, appreciate what you guys are doing. But also, the technology demonstration and the applicability of working and creating a camera that's specifically for that, and what may be used and applicable for future missions to the Moon and Mars. Absolutely incredible. Appreciate what you both do. And thank you for coming on the podcast today. Really appreciate it.  Felix Lajeunesse: Thanks for having us.  Paul Raphael: Thank you.  [ Music ]  Host: Hey, thanks for sticking around. Really fascinating conversation we had with Felix and Paul today about everything that's really gone into working on this film, the “ISS Experience.” Make sure you keep up to date and look for that experience, and then maybe even invest in some virtual reality goggles so you can do the experience its full justice.

                        "description": "Gary Jordan (Host): Houston, we have a podcast. Welcome to the official podcast of the NASA Johnson Space Center, Episode 149, “NASA Photographers.” I'm Gary Jordan, and I'll be your host today. On this podcast, we bring in the experts, scientists, engineers, astronauts all to let you know what's going on in the world of human spaceflight. You know you're into spaceflight, if you have a rocket launch, an astronaut or a photo of Earth from space as the background of your smartphone. Imagery is just one of those things that's hard to beat when it comes to how people engage in human spaceflight. Those famous shots of astronauts walking out in their spacesuits, those shots of celebration at Mission Control, astronauts training, flying jets, they're iconic photos. But as you can imagine, these photos are among the few of the millions of images collected here at the Johnson Space Center. Helping to capture history, share technical data and more is a small team of photographers here at NASA. We're bringing on a few today James Blair, Robert Markowitz and Josh Valcarcel. Each of these fine gentlemen are out and about almost every day capturing history. And to do so, they sometimes find themselves in some of the coolest places at NASA. So here we go, what it's like to be a photographer at NASA with James Blair, Robert Markowitz and Josh Valcarcel. Enjoy.  [ Music]  Host: Robert, James and Josh, thank you so much for coming on Houston, We Have a Podcast today.  Josh Valcarcel: Thanks for having us.  James Blair: Good to be here.  Robert Markowitz: Oh, yeah.  Host: Alright. So, this is the first time we've done it with this many people. I'm excited to talk to you guys because I see you all the time [laughter]. Everything we're doing, you know, we do events, we do mission commentary, and you're always there. You're always there documenting. And you have different roles and different ways that you approach these tasks. So, I'm excited to hear how that's all done from your perspective. I want to get a little bit of backstory because I -- the reason why we have you all here is because you come from different backgrounds, different levels of expertise in different ways on how to approach this. Robert, we'll start with you. What's your background? How did you end up at NASA?  Robert Markowitz: So, I grew up actually in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. And then after my first year of college at University of Oklahoma, decided to go to photo school and went to Rochester Institute of Technology up in Rochester, New York. And had a little job right after graduating from there in a little town outside of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and wasn't really overly happy with that job. So, started looking. So, a lot of times it's background, knowledge, expertise, as well as timing. The photo department here used to have -- all the photographers used to be civil servants. In 1987 they decided to split them and make half contractors, half civil servants. And so, my supervisor right now, Mark Sowa joined in 1987, as well as several other photographers. And one of those decided after a few years to leave the group and go get a civil servant job over in the astronaut office. And so, it opened up a slot about the same time I was looking for a position. So, I joined the group in 1990. And have been here -- this August will actually be 30 years as a photographer. So, kind of neat. You talk to a lot of people. You meet a lot of people out here. There's tons of people that have worked here, you know, 20, 30, 40 years, but most of those have worked in various areas, various disciplines around JSC. So, it's pretty unique to actually be one that's worked here now for 30 years and being in the same job, same discipline, doing the same, same work. So, it kind of is a testament to how much I think we enjoy our work out here.  Host: Same discipline, but really, I mean, I'm sure things are changing all the time and of all the people you must know everyone [laughter]. Honestly, because you have so many different areas that you're hitting right?  Robert Markowitz: Yeah.  Host: And you see some of the same people in different roles.  Robert Markowitz: Exactly. And you see them grow. Sometimes you see them come and go. Sometimes people will be out here for five, 10 years, leave do some different roles and realize how good it is here at NASA and then they'll return. And so, it's definitely interesting seeing the evolvement over time.  Host: Oh, look at that. Congratulations on 30 years. Quite an achievement. James let's go on to you. What's your background?  James Blair: I have a slightly different background from Robert. I started out -- I graduated from [Southern Methodist University] SMU with a degree in anthropology of all things. But I worked at the school newspaper and was the photo editor there, had a fortunate enough to have a mentor from the Associated Press by the name of Eric Gay who, who was a Pulitzer Prize winning photographer. And he mentored me while I was in college. And he kind of showed me the ropes and led me to photo journalism. And after I graduated, I went to work at various newspapers around the country kind of hopped around at medium small newspapers as a photo journalist. Enjoyed it a lot. Enjoyed shooting people in sports. There's a lot of adrenaline involved, and it was fun. Then I happened to be freelancing for the Associated Press in Austin and just heard about the job through a job at NASA opening through a friend of a friend. And I think I may have been the first photographer to submit a portfolio on CD-ROM [laughter]. That kind of dates me. So, and I was lucky enough to get picked and since then, it's been great. There's definitely a learning curve of going from a true photo journalist to working at NASA, doing a lot of studio portraits and production, photography. So, it's been great.  Host: Yeah. So, what are those key differences if you had to sum it up into a paragraph of what it takes to go from the photojournalism from Associated Press to being a NASA photographer?  James Blair: As a photojournalist, you're almost kind of a fly on the wall, you're telling a story and you're trying not to get yourself involved with the story itself. You're just documenting it. And with NASA quite often, you are setting up imagery, setting up scenes, trying to show the public the capabilities of NASA and the hardware and the engineers. So, I had to kind of learn about positioning people and lighting people and where in photojournalism, there's minimal lighting and you know, just trying to let that story happen in front of you. So --  Host: Yeah, you're worried more about the moment when it comes to photojournalism because you want to capture that versus the artistic maybe --  James Blair: But I mean, that still happens here. Working for NASA you're capturing just incredible moments of the crew returns and mission control and EFT-1 where you're trying to capture emotion and the incredible, you know, experiences people are having here at Johnson Space Center.  Host: Yeah. Now Josh, are you in the CD-ROM era or are you a little bit afterwards?  Josh Valcarcel: No, I have a website [laughter].  James Blair: He has Instagram [laugher].  Josh Valcarcel: Instagram, yeah.  Host: Alright, so what's your background?  Josh Valcarcel: Alright, I got started in the Navy. I had no idea what I wanted to do after high school. And I joined the Navy, like a lot of people do. And I saw that photography was an option. And I said that I wanted to do that. And there's a whole story that goes along with this. They said that that was a, you know, a field that was filled up, hard to get into. A lot of people want to do it. And I chose two others as backups. I lied. I really only wanted that one job. I never intended to join the Navy if I didn't get it. But there's a long-delayed entry program. You know, they're working with me for months, they take me down two hours, you know, to process. And at the last minute, they say, you know, that job photographer isn't available. And I just looked at him, I was like, it's going to be real long ride home [laughter]. So, he looks at me and then he goes back into the room. He comes back out. He's like, it's just, you know, it popped up. You know, you're so lucky. So that's how I got started. I called this recruiter on his bluff. It was the best decision I ever made [laughter]. I never had any experience with photography prior to joining the Navy. Went to boot camp after boot camp. They put you through a four-month crash course. At the time it was basic still photography. And I was one of the last classes to learn on film in the beginning, for about a month. And yeah, it was amazing. It was a joint service school. The Defense Information School is in Fort Meade, Maryland. And they just run you through the gamut, awards, ceremonies, grip and grins, documentation, combat photography, studio portraiture, everything you can imagine they just -- that's your life. And then they just spit you out into the fleet. And I was lucky enough to go to San Diego, at the Public Affairs Center Pacific there. And so, I basically worked a day job. But every year I would deploy on a different ship and augment their media department. So, I deployed on three different boats. I went to over 20 different countries in the time I was in the Navy, which is about five years. Yeah. And got a lot of experience. Unless you do something really stupid, they're not going to fire you. So, I had lots of opportunities to fail confidently, which I still like to think that I do. And after the Navy, I went to college. I went to the Brooks Institute, which at the time was this legendary -- I hope still now a legendary photo college. That is now extinct. It went away. It was unfortunately mismanaged. And, you know, it went under, but the time I had there and what I learned was just immense. I like to think that the Navy taught me how to take pictures, but Brooks taught me how to tell stories. And so that's why I took leaving college. Timing worked out in such a way where in my last year of school, I really gravitated towards science. I felt that that was a subject that was -- they just didn't seem like a lot of photographers were gunning for shooting scientific subjects and I had this natural kind of inclination to it. And so, I decided to go that route. I really fell in love with Wired Magazine. I found a ton of Wired magazines in the school library, and I just kind of like, start checking a bunch of these out, love the style. And I decided I want to work for Wired Magazine in my last year. And there's a whole chain of events that happened but as soon as I graduated, two weeks later, I was working there as an online photo editor and staff photographer. So, did that for three years. It was amazing. I got to help make a magazine every month. See how that process worked. It was super creative. It was super open. If you had an idea, you can take it across to another desk. And if they liked it, you can collaborate and synergize. I did stand ups for video. I wrote a few stories. I went to Comic-Con. I went to the Consumer Electronics Show. It was just a whole different world. And that's where I really got into product photography. That was pretty much my world, was shooting products for reviews. And, you know, so I did well there. I was brought on as a contractor initially at Wired, then I got hired on as staff. And then in my third year I was laid off because, you know, publications are kind, like tumultuous industry. It happens. It was a really dark time. It was a really, you know, insecure moment. But I like bringing that up because the you know, the time of greatest doubt came right before, you know, the best time of my career which is getting my job here at NASA. It was just amazing. Again, fortunate turn of events. I looked and there it was. And I think it's important to note that Robert mentioned earlier we're all contractors. So, the job title didn't say NASA photographer. It said, scientific photographer for my contractor, Analytical Mechanics Associates, which on the surface, what is that? You click on it, and it's the job description. It's just being a NASA photographer. And it sounded amazing. So, it was kind of hidden. I applied to that, you know, I had no idea how the system worked. Applied. didn't hear anything back. Two weeks later, you know, my girlfriend and I looked on LinkedIn, we found out who worked here. We found, you know, Robert's LinkedIn. We found our supervisor Mark's. And I emailed Mark and I said, \"Hey, I just want to reiterate my interest in this job.\" It was a Sunday night. Following morning, he emails back saying, \"We didn't get your application.\" I guess the company had stopped sending them to him. It didn't open for like two weeks already or more. And so that's how I got an interview that week and ultimately got hired. So, now I've been here for about two years and eight months now.  Host: A little bit of luck, a little bit of persistence. What a story.  Josh Valcarcel: For sure. Yeah.  Host: That's awesome. I love your phrase “fail confidently,” that was --  Josh Valcarcel: Right on.   Host: Yeah, I like that a lot. That's really good. That's a great way to learn is to do and have that kind of freedom to express different ideas and themes. And if it works great, if it doesn't --  Josh Valcarcel: You learn something.  Host: Yeah, you learn something. I wanted to go back, one thing that I kind of locked on was right in the beginning, you said you were going to the Navy and you wanted photography. And then the two others were lies, but you really want photography but had no prior experience with photography. What was it that drove you to that?  Josh Valcarcel: They had a magazine and it was a silly photo of just, you know, there's something to do in the Navy where you man the rails -- coming back into port after deployment. All the sailors put on their dress whites, and they line along the edges of the boat. And they had a picture. It was a panoramic and above each sailor they all look the same. That was the point. But they had jobs written above them and pointing down to each sailor so you can see what they all did. And one of them said photographer. I never thought that you can do that in the military. So, I was like -- that's what I want to do. That's how it jumped out at me. That was the first step. I don't know why I felt so -- it just seemed like the fun thing to do. I like to draw. My brother is a cartoonist. So, I just like artistic stuff, anything I could do creatively. So, it just seemed if I was going to get through the military, I had to do something creative, to give myself the best shot at being successful, and just kind of getting through it. And so, I just kind of went on good faith. But I will say that the only epiphany I've ever had in my life was when I was -- my first day of photo school, which was August 9th in 2005. I remember it, because it's like a birthday for me. And it was the day we clashed up at DINFOS, the Defense Information School. And they show you your [single-lens reflex] SLR and lenses is the first time I've ever held one. And they take you on a tour of all the different rooms and aspects of the course that you'll be introduced to. And they had print rooms, you know, you saw photos that students had taken up on the walls. And I just had this feeling, you know, I just had this feeling that very, you know, potent sense. This is what I wanted to do the rest of my life. Like I'd found something that I had somehow managed to go this long without getting exposed to this way directly. And I just felt like, \"Oh, this is my thing. This is what I'm going to pour my heart and soul into.\" And I'm 15 years in now. And I feel like it's proof that that was real. That that sense, that feeling I had was absolutely authentic.  Host: Wow, that's significant. It starts with just looking at a magazine saying, \"Hmm, I want to explore that more.\" And then next thing you know, you're set. You're rock solid. This is your life.  Josh Valcarcel: Yeah. It sounded fun.  Host: Yeah, for sure. Alright, so let's kind of explore what being a NASA photographer is all about. Robert, we'll go back to you. Thinking about what you're doing. I don't want to say on a day to day basis, because that's probably not accurate, but a snapshot of all the different things you're covering.  Robert Markowitz: Well, what's funny is, Josh mentioned first picking up a camera in 2005. Was that correct?  Josh Valcarcel: Right. Yeah.  Robert Markowitz: So, I'd already been here for 15 years [laughter]. But I think you kind of, you know, hit the nail on the head with the key thing about being a NASA photographer is we wear multiple hats. And we basically do something different every single day. So, a lot of people, you know, you have food photographers, you have people that photograph furniture, you have people that photograph models, whatever it is, but they're doing the same thing every day. And I knew in college, I was very interested in the corporate, annual report style of photography. So, I knew that early on that that's the kind of photography I wanted to do. So, you know, after college, I went and applied for -- I probably sent out 200 or more resumes across the country, just because I knew I wanted to do it. So, I send it to the Boeing's and all those kinds of companies. And so, when I, you know, found this job, I knew it was the perfect fit. And so, the coolest thing is, is that, you know, one day you could be photographing the center director, you can be photographing his official portrait in our studio or in his office. You could be doing an award ceremony. But we also get into severe or high-end technical photography, where we do high speed photography, time lapse photography. Like James said, production shoots, we find ourselves in different environments. All three of us have actually flown and qualified on the T-38 aircraft. James and I have photographed in NASA's Zero-g aircraft over multiple of years. Back in the day, we actually -- my supervisor and I were actually trained and performed underwater photography. Back in the early days when we had the WETF here or the Weightless Environment Training Facility, both he and I actually got trained out here and then when our bigger pool got built to handle the space station assembly, Mark and I actually dove for a number of years, four or five years out in that facility. And, you know, we would document activities like the Hubble Space Telescope repair missions, the initial assembly of International Space Station. So it was that variety that has kept it unique and interesting over the years and it continues to do so this day.  Host: Yeah, yeah. One of the things that jumps in my mind is, what is, what is it about being a NASA photographer for 30 years that makes you want to continue to do that? It sounds like it's just -- it's never boring. You have a different day, you have a different mindset, you get to learn new things. You get to be certified in all of these different things in aircraft, underwater, not in the same day, obviously. But [laughter] I mean, it's just -- it's new. It's a unique experience. Just said Zero gravity. This is incredible. James, tell me about some of those moments, like, you know, being certified for flying in the T-38 or what's that like to go through that process and then start taking aerial photography.  James Blair: That was probably the pinnacle of my career here was putting on that flight vest and getting into a T-38. So yeah, that was a dream come true. As a kid always wanted to fly in a jet. I didn't quite have the right stuff to make it through the Navy or Air Force. So, I just feel incredibly fortunate to be able to do it for NASA. And even better, I get to take photos while flying in the backseat of a T-38. It's amazing. It's probably also one of the most exhausting assignments [laughter] you'll have. it's exhilarating. So, you're working with adrenaline plus you're fighting with your harness that you're in. And you're trying to twist around and dealing with g-forces and it's amazing. It's a dream come true.  Host: So, Josh, what are you doing on those flights? Are you just taking, you know, nice cool photos of planes? Is there a technical aspect to it that helps pilots to learn or to understand how things working?  Josh Valcarcel: So, I've only flown twice. My first was a checkout flight, which was just, you know, getting adapted to the, you know, the craft. This is what it feels like. And the second flight was a video shoot to actually shoot T-38's information. And it was a video shoot. And I can attest everything James just said, it's exhausting. I had to take Dramamine so that you know, I wouldn't get sick. And it was the first shoot I had that was, I had an assignment where I actually had to hold the camera up. And when the aircraft starts to move, you start taking g’s and the camera weighs 60 pounds all of a sudden. And you're trying to hold it steady out the window or you know, you know, pointing outside and it starts to just come towards your chest. And you're pushing as hard as you can against it and it's still coming towards your chest. Your body is shaking and you're wondering, \"How am I going to get a clean shot out of this?\" Not to mention the canopy is wide open to the sunlight. It's pouring in. There is reflections everywhere. You're trying to look through your mask at the LCD screen. You have a limited range of motion. You can barely turn your shoulders. So, it's just a really fun challenge to try and solve [laughter]. That's my explanation of that.  Host: Fun. I don't know why you pick that word fun. That sounds -- yeah. I’m exhausted just listening to it.  Robert Markowitz: An important note to make is, especially in the T-38 environment, but whether it be in that environment, or almost any shoot that we go on, we're in situations where you have one chance to get the shot. And so, it costs a lot of money to get those aircraft up in the air. It costs a lot of money to put us in the backseat. So, when we're tasked to do a job, we need to make sure that we come out there with the best imagery that's possible. So, you know, some of the environments that I was in, and some of my flying -- so I mentioned earlier about the Zero-g plane. Well, it's always nice to have photos and videos of the outside of the Zero-g plane performing its maneuvers. So, the public can see it, they can use it in videos and posters and things like that. So, we actually -- one of the flights went into a T-38 and had to mimic the exact flight pattern of the Zero-g plane. And because T-38s really aren't made to be in that type of environment. Yes, they can go you know, Zero-g, negative g’s, plus g’s, but it's really not meant to be in a Zero-g for any sustained length of time. So, the Zero-g plane is usually about a 30 second period of weightlessness, where it's going from 36,000 feet to about 26,000 feet for that Zero-g time. The T-38s aren't really meant to be in that configuration for that amount of length of time. But usually what we did was do about four parabolas. We do two parabolas and do still pictures and then we do two parabolas and capture video. After that you're done. So, you better make sure that you got those images during that time.  Host: That's it, you have two chances for stills, two chances.  Robert Markowitz: Right.  Host: And that's it. [multiple speakers].  James Blair: A lot of preparation involved for each flight.  Host: What kinds of preparation? What do you --  James Blair: You want to make sure you're very familiar with your camera equipment you're going to use. You want to make sure it's the appropriate camera equipment for the job. Know your settings, know your lighting and you want to take as little equipment up in the T-38 as possible. You can't bring two cameras. You can't bring backups. Just because of the size constraint, there's no stowage anywhere. So, it's key to know your stuff when you go up.  Host: So, when you're putting on -- you talked about different hats that you have to put on. You have to put on your technical hat. You have to put on your artistic hat. Let's put on the technical hat for just a second, Josh. When you're putting on the technical hat, what is it that you are focusing on? What is it that you have to get out of this technical photography and deliver to who?  Josh Valcarcel: So, these guys taught me how to think this way. One of the things I had to adjust to was shooting something for engineering purposes, or for analytical purposes versus for outreach, or basic documentation. And sometimes they're totally separate shoots and other times they're happening kind of at the same time and you've got to switch hats on the fly. And one of the things that I learned and James, you helped me a lot with this early on was, sometimes you'll just have an object. And you'll go from shooting the event, you know, the training that's unfolding, till they pull you aside, and they say, \"Hey, take a picture of this thing.\" And I've learned now that what they mean was, they're not looking for a pretty picture, although I'm going to make sure it's well exposed and visible, you know. But the primary purpose of that is to show information that then they can analyze and do science with or you make assessments from. And so, you know, I don't need to make it perfect. I just need to make sure that it's legible. And from certain angles, you know, probably get everything they need. I have developed a sense for, you know, trying to cover all the bases. That's pretty counterintuitive to a photographer who's thinking about composition most of the time, and aesthetics. All that goes out the window. And now I'm thinking about content and readability.  Host: So how do you know what to capture, James? What are some of the lessons you've taught Josh? How do you know what to capture? And then how do you know when it's your time to go in during a test or during this moment and then take these photographs and what angles to take? And what would be most beneficial from the eye of an engineer?  James Blair: Sure. I mean, first is talking to the engineer and asking them what's the key moment? What's the key item? What should I be looking for? What gizmo, what action? You know, they, you know, are there scratches on the surface of the item, you know, you want to light it a certain way to highlight those scratches? Or bringing the proper lens, the macro lens and lighting it properly, getting close. And quite often they want you to get inside an item and piece of hardware and light up the inside and just knowing how to do that. Yeah, just communication is key when it comes to engineering. And yeah, it's definitely different from public affair imagery.  Host: Yeah, and they're not photographers, either. So, when they say, \"I want that, and I want it well lit.\" You're like, \"OK, I'm the expert here. And I have to figure out how to do that to get the results that this person is looking for.\"  James Blair: Exactly.  Host: Robert, you mentioned some other stuff, too. You mentioned like time lapses and images over time, you know, stills, videos, everything. They want good data to make assessments.  Robert Markowitz: Right. So, the other side of the coin of that technical capability of knowing how to expose things well, know what the engineers are looking for, is to keep up with the technology. So of course, when I started, we basically only did still acquisition. So, we were still photography department. Video was actually accomplished from a different department. So, we didn't have to worry -- we only had to know, and of course, we didn't have digital cameras then, and it was all film cameras. So, we just, you know, had to know our, you know, normal 35-millimeter still cameras, medium format still cameras. We also did four by five. So, you had to know that older technology. That's all you need to know plus the flash equipment, everything like that. Of course, then when we transition to digital, you know, that technology became a little bit more difficult interfacing with the computers, the computer software. So, the learning curve, you know, became a little higher. And then a number of years ago, we actually acquired the video acquisition portion. So now we do both still and video. So now in addition to all of the, you know, standard, still photography equipment, we also have to keep up with all the video technology, the cameras, the audio, everything of that end. Plus, the technical -- the other types of -- all phenomenal types of acquisition, right? So, the time lapse, the high speed. So high speed photography, you know, 30 years ago, we also captured on traditional film. So, we used Millican cameras. They held 400-foot rolls and we shot mostly at 400 frames per second speed cameras. And now it's all transitioned to digital. And so now you have to learn the new technologies of the new cameras. And of course, the frame rates now of these cameras go up to 10,000 20,000 50,000 frames per second. And that's even still on the slow end of things that we're capturing. So, you're constantly keeping up with, you know, the changes, the technologies, how to utilize them, how to, you know, choose the best equipment to give the engineers exactly what they need.  Host: How do you keep up with that then? Are you getting a -- signing up for a bunch of different magazines and reading them as you get the time? Do you set aside time in your job?  James Blair: It used to be magazines now find anything on the internet. And YouTube is a great source of information about new technology. So yeah, it's transitioned. But yet we have to stay on top of the new trends. Absolutely.  Host: Yeah, that's got to be big for it. Alright. Now, let's put on a different hat. I know Josh, you talked about composition when you're thinking -- you have to switch away from your composition style of thinking to the technical. Now going back to that composition, what's a moment as a NASA photographer where you have to think about that and use all those skills?  Josh Valcarcel: I would say most of the time from virtually everything you're shooting. If it's an award ceremony, you're still thinking about aesthetics and composition, lighting. You're trying to make everything look as good as it can, regardless of what you're doing. If it's an educational event, you know, children are engaged in learning. You're trying to get them the best photo as possible for them. Or it's an astronaut getting ready to suit up to go into the NBL. You know, you're doing the best you can with the lighting available with the lighting you can bring in. And even if you've shot it tons of times, you're still trying to give it the attention it deserves in the moment. Because this is pretty unique, you know?  Host: Yeah.  Josh Valcarcel: And yeah, we do, do things on a day to day basis, but history is still being made every single day. And I remember the first time I went to the NBL, James took me there. And it was an astronaut getting suited up. And I remember just getting so excited. I still get excited when I go over there. But I was just taking a ton of pictures and you know, James, I can't even imagine how many times you've shot this. But I come out of there, I, you know, we leave, we go back to the office, I'm still there, but it's like, they're making history over there. You know, it's just like I was so jazzed by it. And it's just really important to, like, not lose sight of that. Because, you know, after 20 times of doing it, it's still the same, that same feeling I had from that first moment. It's the same truth, you know. So just I got to make sure that I hang on to it and apply everything that I know, everything that I've gleaned from my career so far, to making it as powerful and as impactful as possible as it is.  Host: Yeah. I know one of the key moments I'm thinking about some of those NBL photos. I like -- there's always one where they have to put the astronauts on this rig. They're fully suited up. They got all their umbilical’s and they move this giant rig and they start dipping them in the pool. And there's this moment where they just they're just submersing. They're going underwater and a lot of them do something. They throw up like they wave, or they throw out like horns or you know, thumbs up, whatever. They do something like that. That's like a moment that you know is coming and you're like, \"I have to be ready to capture that.\" Maybe one of the few that are a little bit predictable other than that you're just looking for your moments.  James Blair: True.  Host: Yeah. So, let's talk about going under the water. You talked about both of you went under the water and did some photography there. Now what's it like to, you know, Josh described having to hold this camera against g’s and film in a plane. Now what are some of the techniques you need to film underwater?  Robert Markowitz: I think it actually when you ask the question, I think about it, it all has to do with trying to predict where you need to be to get the best shot. And I think no matter the environment you're in, whether it's, you know, voting on the Zero-g plane or capturing imagery in mission control or at the NBL or underwater, you always want to try to be in the best position to capture the most interesting, the picture that will tell the story the best. Give the engineers the information they need, but also be cognizant of your location to make sure that you're also not getting in the way. You don't want to be blocking flight director's view of the front screen. You don't want to be, you know, getting in the way of suit technicians slowing their process down of suiting up the astronauts. You always need to be cognizant of where you're at, what you're doing, get your job done, but make sure you're not inhibiting other people getting their job done.  Host: Yeah, fly on the wall, just like you were saying. Yeah, you have to be there, be present and capture the moment but not be in anyone's way. People are trying to do jobs.  Robert Markowitz: One of the things that you also kind of brought up with doing part of the creativity was, you know, being a NASA photographer, you have to kind of do things a certain way. There's a certain, you know, method and a certain, you know, look that NASA imagery, you know, expects and the program expects, and the center director expects. So, we're always cognizant to get those pictures kind of in the back. And so that's, you know, if we're doing an astronaut portrait in a, you know, spacesuit or something like that, there's always the shots that we need to get or a crew portrait. But the nice thing is, is that with they always leave us room for creativity. So, there's been many times where, you know, we could spend, you know, an hour with a crew member on a portrait and make sure we get all of our, you know, shots that we need to get that NASA needs. But then it gives us some time to do some creative shots of the crew member or crew portraits. And oftentimes, unexpectedly, when the crew member is deciding what pictures they want to best represent them or best represent their crew, they'll sometimes go with those creative shots that were kind of off the cuff that we just come up with, you know, during a session. So, it's always you know, neat when those kinds of situations arise.  Host: Josh what's it like working with astronauts? And how it differs from astronaut to astronaut and what they're willing to do to be creative?  Josh Valcarcel: Well, I think it's really important to follow up with what Robert just said to make sure that everyone knows that Robert is the photographer that shot Leland Melvin with the two dogs [laughter]. Which is my favorite shot.  Host: That is a famous one.  Robert Markowitz: It has become quite recognizable.  Host: Yeah, wow.  Josh Valcarcel: So that's huge [laughter]. So, my favorite part of working here is having the astronauts in the studio. It's a controlled scenario. There's an opportunity there that I never want to not take advantage of. And they're all just so nice. They really are like, that's one of the most beautiful things about interacting with them is this not only are these just incredibly capable individuals, but they're just, they'll listen to you, you know. They're present. They're just good people. And I feel like they're just great subjects to shoot. And I want to show that, and I want to convey how that feels. And so yeah, we go through the -- we do the official shots, there's the list of things that we need to knock out. But I always try at the end of every studio session to carve out whatever time I can have left to do something creative, to do something different. To apply some kind of vision behind it. I'll have a different backdrop set up. I'll have different lights set up. And I'll Have the radio transceivers ready to just switch to a different channel. So, at the very end, I just switched to hit the switch, drop the new backdrop down and take advantage of whatever time is available, whatever time they want to give me and do some creative portraits. I've done some stuff in black and white that I'm really proud of that's been really fun. I kind of worked out a series that I've been chipping away at. It's just you know that these people are going into outer space and coming back, and it's just kind of amazing. Like I'm at a loss for words to really describe it, but I'll say that there was some that I had in the studio. You know, let's take Luke and Drew that are up there right now. They just finished the AMS Spacewalk. Not only did I get the opportunity to shoot them both in the studio in their [Extravehicular Mobility Unit] EMU suits, I got to photograph them training on the -- the basically training for the [Extravehicular Activity] EVA that they just accomplished. I got to document that a lot. And then I'm in mission control, taking pictures of the flight controllers with them on screen in space, doing the spacewalk, and I'm familiar with the activities that they're going through. I can see what they're doing. And I know, oh, this part is really complicated, because I've seen them work through this, work this out in real time on the ground. And that's huge. Putting people in outer space and then bringing them back home. And they're effectively your coworkers.  Host: Yeah, yeah, you're going on the journey with them.  Josh Valcarcel: Pretty much.  Host: They're training, and you can see them preparing for what they're about to do in space, then you're there. So, I mean, I'm sure you just want to turn the camera around and take a picture like, \"Look, I'm here, I took the journey with you.\"  Josh Valcarcel: Right.  Host: But you know, everyone else did too. Everyone else took the you're trying to capture the flight controllers, because they put a ton of work into it. The engineers because you know that they're putting -- they're giving everything they have to train these crew members to do this task. So, you are right there with the same emotions that a lot of these trainers are feeling and trying to capture that and document that.  Josh Valcarcel: 100 percent.  Host: And not just the technical aspects, but yeah.  Josh Valcarcel: Yeah, it's monumental. I don't know how many societies are capable of putting human beings in outer space. You know, throughout history, this is relatively new. It's not something to take for granted.  Host: Yeah. Now there's a lot of historical elements to this. And we've talked about all these different moments, all these different techniques, all these images that you're capturing. We talked about the movement to digital. With digital comes a new way of taking photos, and that's snap, snap, snap, snap, snap, snap, snap, right? You're taking a lot. I'm sure it could be on the order of thousands a day. So how do you shift through that? How do you shuffle through and pick? These are the ones we're going to send to people? These are the ones we're going to post publicly? These are the we are going to archive?  James Blair: Sure. I mean, yeah, I started out shooting film and going to an event shooting, you know, three or four rolls of 35-millimeter. I thought that was a lot. But with digital, you can -- digital doesn't cost anything. You just shoot and shoot. And you have to kind of hold back sometimes and remember, slow down and think more about the shots you're going to get. But when you get back to the office and you start screening your imagery, I think unlike your traditional photographer, we have like, we've been saying you have to put on different hats and you have to select imagery for different customers. It may be one assignment, but there are different people who are going to use your imagery from that one assignment, whether it be public release, or engineering. And so, we generally pick a larger group of images for all customers. The public release imagery, you're looking for that right moment with a nice smile on the face, and the right good lighting. But the engineering documentation is a little more subtle. You generally shoot a larger volume of imagery because you never know quite what the engineer -- what detail that engineer is looking for. So --  Host: That's a different way of thinking about it. Because in one way, if you're trying to document, you want the best documentation. And from your mind as a photographer, you kind of have a better idea of what is the best moment and what's the best style, what's the best angle to document. Now, with the engineering aspect of things, you're not in that mindset, because you don't know what is the best. So, you have to almost do everything.  James Blair: Yeah, with engineering documentation quite often you're documenting every step of the process. So, you'll end up with sometimes hundreds of images. And mixed in with those hundreds of images is a select few public release images you would consider.  Host: Wow, Robert, I can't even imagine what this was like before digital because you're talking about going through hundreds of images and saying, \"Here you go engineers, like this is this is what you requested.\" Was it the same with film or did they just not get the right data? How did that work?  Robert Markowitz: I think we definitely shot less. I'm thinking of some, you know, back in the shuttle days when they used to do the emergency egress activities, either in Building 9, [Space Vehicle Mockup Facility], practicing there or egress activities out at the NBL that we used to. So it was, you know, full suited events. And those were, you know, multi-hours, usually three or four hour, you know, suited events for, you know, a crew of seven. And we'd be out there the entire time. And most of that we used -- in the early days, we used to shoot on medium format film or Hasselblads. And, you know, I usually shoot probably what's called a brick. So, like five rolls of 24 exposure, and, you know, if it was, you know, a busy shoot, you may shoot two of those. So, in the realm of it, it's still not very many today, on an event like that, you probably easily shoot 500 to 1,000 exposures. You know, I just photographed a retirement ceremony last night for a director that's been here for you know, over about 46 years that just retired. And you know, it was a well-received event and she had tons of people there celebrating her work out here. And you know, I, just my raw images, I shot nearly 700 pictures. So, you know, you'll get back to the office because you want to make sure that you captured it correctly and captured all the people that were important in her life. But you know, you'll come back, and you know, maybe submit a couple of hundred from that. So, you know, you're always shooting a lot more, but it enables you to get really the best shot possible. So, it's really been -- digital has definitely been a great thing for photography. It's definitely added more work on the back end than the than the front end. People sometimes don't realize the amount of time it takes to screen through all of those hundreds and thousands of images sometimes. But it does allow us to capture, I think better imagery in the end.  Host: Yeah. So, what do you think is more intensive, processing thousands of digital images or converting film into something usable? I don't even know how that worked.  Robert Markowitz: It's definitely intensive screening through. And it depends on the event. Sometimes, some things are easier to screen than others, depending on what you're looking at [laughter].  Host: Yeah, yeah, that can be absolutely true. It sounds like Josh that there's these barriers when it comes to being a NASA photographer as to what you guys are responsible for. It seems like you get a request to, to photograph something. And then there's a period of time where you have to look through the best of that imagery and then either post it somewhere and then from there, it sounds like you hand it off to someone else. And that's depends on what it is. Is it going out publicly? Is it going to be archived? So, what's that end process like when it comes to your nav screen through 700 images because you just are done with the event? You have to sit down, you have to go through, what happens next?  Josh Valcarcel: One of the more unique aspects of working as a photographer here is, we have a photo lab that basically edits in tones all our images. And so, we do the initial screening. We crop and we kind of choose which images from the entire shoot are worth putting forward. And then we have an entire photo lab team that goes forth. And then we'll color balance and make everything look great. Hundreds of images that we don't have to process it, we could just go out and keep shooting, multiple shoots per day, if we have to. I can't really speak to anything beyond that. I know it gets archived, I know it's available for you know, if it's not restricted for any specific reason. It's available to those on site. But I can speak to how it's chosen to be released publicly. If anything, I think you could [laughter].  Host: No. That's true. Yeah, we have a task where every you know, every once in a while, we'll have to go through either images coming from station or images of events that we know are happening. And then you pick you know, you go down from 700. And you go down to I don't know, let's say 100. And then from that 100, we choose three. And then that's kind of how it goes out to the public. Is you have chosen the best of the imagery that you are ready to archive or put wherever. But it's up to us to then post those three. Because we've already discussed, I mean, we're talking thousands of images a day. I mean, you can't post all of that. So, it would just be, you wouldn't be able to find what you wanted. It wouldn’t be very useful to anyone. So, making sure that we screen that is something that's really important.  Robert Markowitz: And social media I think is nice to the photographers nowadays, to be able to actually, you know, see our imagery out there on Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, wherever NASA decides to post them. Versus back in the day where, you know, some, you know, maybe ten years later, you might see your photo appear in some magazine or book or something similar. So now we see things a lot more frequently posted online. And it's pretty rewarding to have your pictures out there.  Host: Yeah. Do you find that there's value in -- seeing that in maybe a certain amount of inspiration that comes from people looking at this imagery? Because, you know, one thing that I think NASA is super good at when it comes to even, government agency, but just a business is we have some of the best imagery. You just can't beat it. And you're talking about being a fly on the wall and taking a picture of some training. Yeah, maybe it's just the day, \"OK, I got to go capture this training.\" But to some it is something that could possibly define a career path.  Josh Valcarcel: I mean, think about all the images we've seen throughout our lives about human space travel. We get to add to the iconography of that going forward. That's so huge. You just don't know what picture is going to resonate with somebody and create an impact. It could be anything.  Host: James, do you have some moments, some training, some event that you have captured that was just so -- that stuck with you?  James Blair: I was fortunate enough to be on a helicopter during EFT-1, Orion's EFT-1, where the capsule was coming back in during re-entry. And I was on a Blackhawk helicopter -- no excuse me, not Blackhawk, Seahawk, a Navy Seahawk helicopter. And there had been so much training, so much preparation for just this one moment. And the hardest thing, my biggest fear was being able to spot it. It's just like a needle, just a pinhead up in the sky. And I just saw this glimmer in the sky. And I just, I have, I was using an 800-millimeter lens, and I just, I grabbed on to it. And I was just shocked that I found it and so early up in its re-entry and followed it all the way down. And that was probably one of my most memorable moments. I was probably one of the closest people to the capsule as it re-entered. And it was a great experience that you know, Josh has been in the Navy, but I'd never been on a navy ship. And so, we had travelled to -- it was out in the Pacific where we covered the re-entry. And we floated out on a navy ship. And that was a great experience too. So --  Host: Yeah, just being on the ship is unique in and of itself. But this is EFT-1. This is the test mission of Orion. It was going super far away from Earth. And then it was the test, one of the parts of the test was to come screaming through the atmosphere at 25,000 miles per hour. So, the fact that you were able to find this little tiny dot coming from almost -- it was this lunar space. It was it was kind of near the Moon coming through in the middle of the Pacific Ocean. That's just I mean, that's a moment that you know, you can plan for it. But I mean, anything could happen. You can have clouds. You can have clouds. You can be facing the wrong direction. The helicopter pilot could be making a hard bank and then next thing you know, you lose it.  James Blair: Yeah, that was all in the training. I mean, it was, everything happened the way it was supposed to happen. It was, we were in the right spot, the right time. The capsule landed on the right spot and all the training paid off. So that was a great feeling.  Host: Yeah. Robert, do you have something like that where you just have something that you have to capture right in the moment. And that's it. You just have that one shot because it's not like you can say, \"Alright, Orion, sorry, I missed it. Could you go back through the atmosphere and then come back in. Just tell me where you are. So, I can get you next time.\"  Robert Markowitz: Yeah, so when you tell a lot of people that you're a NASA photographer, usually the question you get is OK, what's the coolest thing you've ever photographed?   Host: Yeah.  Robert Markowitz: And so that's definitely, I have. I usually have a top three. But, for again, being the toughest shoot and kind of, you know, you have one time only to pull it off. I was fortunate enough to fly back seat when they retired the space shuttles and they took all the space shuttles to various science museums across the country. And so, before they landed the shuttles in the various cities, they did fly arounds of each city. And so, we chased the shuttle on back of the 747 and captured it flying over Washington, D.C., New York City for one on the Intrepid so I was in the backseat capturing those photos, as it was going across the Mall in Washington D.C. and down the Hudson and in New York City. And you only had one chance. And so, a lot of times I could specifically remember sitting in the backseat being alongside, taking the pictures out the window of the canopy of the T-38 and literally thinking I should pinch myself. Because this is such an abnormal, unusual place to be taking pictures like this. But those are actually some of the, you know, most memorable photographs I think I've, you know, captured almost since I've been out here for 30 years. You know, that iconic shot with the shuttle going down the Mall in Washington D.C. We can see the National Monument in the capital from one end to the other. In New York City, I captured a really neat shot. And I remember, you know, kind of looking through my viewfinder is, you know, we're flying the path. And I can see the image appearing in my viewfinder and I'm like, OK, in a second, it's going to it's going to come, it's going to come. And the shuttle crosses the park and get the whole downtown area in the background. And it was just a really beautiful shot that I captured.   Host: It was a moment that you knew was coming too right? Because you had to study the flight plan. You knew it was in the background. You knew your moments --  Robert Markowitz: But as James said, there's a lot of things that can go wrong with that. But it all came together. And I was really pleased with the way that image turned out.  Host: I'd be half tempted to just put the camera down and just witness it, yeah, yeah. I have trouble with that too, because I want to take photos of a lot of parts of my life like a lot of people do now and post them on social media. But sometimes, I just you know, I want to take the camera down and just kind of soak it all in. But this is a key moment for not just you but is for many people. Because a lot of people have worked on these shuttles. They've captured the hearts and minds of all these people. I mean, there were crowds coming out, right? I've remember I was one of my first actually, my very first internship was to work the Endeavour flyover for Houston. And so, I was over at Ellington Field. And I was working education activities handing out little, you know, having people try on gloves and stuff. But I saw it. I got to capture it from you know, not as well, as good of a view as you guys. But I had my phone going across Ellington Field, I think it did two passes or something. Just a wonderful moment and just to be a part of that was significant. Josh, what about you? Favorite moment.  Josh Valcarcel: Favorite moment? I have not been pressed that much yet. I've been kind of training going in that direction. I would say my favorite thing that I've had the opportunity to shoot here so far was the Wilderness Survival Training with a new group of astronaut candidates that are now astronauts, they recently graduated. That was just the most meaningful thing I've ever gotten the chance to do. And I went with them to Maine, spent a week with them, basically camping, just documenting their training. And it's an important moment for them. It's early on in their training. So, they're getting to kind of know each other. And I felt like, I kind of get to know them too and become part of the community here. Which is a really special thing to be a part of, is a very familiar atmosphere. You know, it feels really tight knit. And that was my introduction basically into the job and into the culture and into the world of like, what we're doing and why and who's going, and it was just very cool.  Host: Yeah, I love -- you have such a unique perspective as a NASA photographer. And I'm going back to when you were talking about the Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer Spacewalk training, and you got to see Andrew Morgan and Luca Parmitano train for doing this thing. Then you saw it in space, and you were with all these different teams. That's I think something that's very unique to a NASA photographer is because, you know, an engineer, you know, you might be an engineer for just the Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer, high fidelity mock-up that goes on the [Active Response Gravity Offload System] ARGOS. And that's it. And that's what you do. And maybe, you know, you don't get as much time with the divers at the NBL. You don't get much time with the crew trainers over here. But you're seeing all parts of it. You're seeing all parts of it. And you're a part of that journey. What is it you try to capture in the photography to try to tell that story because it's a story that I think is maybe unique, but it's necessary? It is the journey from start to finish.  Josh Valcarcel: I like to think of myself as a time traveler that is from the future and I'm back in time and I'm documenting history. So that's the overarching sort of theme that I work with. But generally, I try to meet people in events where they're at. So, I just try and see it as a moment in time, like a corner of eternity. And this is only going to happen once. And then tomorrow will be another thing. But each person has their part to play and is truly invested in it. So, if there's a moment where you can see it on their face, you try and capture it. If they're collaborating with each other, and you're trying to solve a problem, and it's the middle of happening, you try and capture that too. There's so many ways that this experience can kind of manifest itself in front of you. And you just try and be in tune and open to how that can come about with wherever you happen to be standing or wherever you could be standing.  Host: Yeah. Robert, you probably have more of an understanding along these lines of -- and I've heard this term quite a bit, just being at NASA these past few years, the NASA family. But you see it a little bit more from all like, again, all of these different disciplines, all these different areas that most people at NASA don't get to explore all the time. We just not in all the buildings. We're not we're not seeing all the people and all the unique -- you probably have a better aspect than most, a better perspective of seeing all of what is the NASA family. And all the different subcultures and what brings it together as one unique family. What have you seen just over these past 30 years? To really define that.  Robert Markowitz: Well, the thing that comes to mind the most is when you go out and you photograph or you talk to different people, a lot of people will say, \"You guys probably have the coolest job out here except for the astronauts,\" which is pretty much true. Because, you know, we're at everything. So, you know, you think about the astronauts training, like Josh said, you know, we were pretty much all involved in a lot of the AMS training. And, literally, you know, you feel like you can, you know, of course, we can't do their jobs, but you almost you become very familiar with what they're doing.  Host: Yeah, you want to point to a boat and be like, that one right there --  Robert Markowitz: When you see, you know, it on TV and in mission control of what they're doing, you have experienced it, you know. Underwater when we used to do the documentation underwater, and, you know, they're assembling the pieces of the space station. We were there as they were practicing these things. And repairing the Hubble Space Telescope. But the family is definitely true. Being out here for so many years, whether you see people here or outside of work or on travel, in airports. It's just one big family. I remember one time I got on a Southwest flight and ran into a retired astronaut that was flying for Southwest. And you know, he was greeting passengers coming onboard and was like, \"Hey, how you doing? Hey long time no see.\" So, you just run out, you know, you run into people, you know, in the grocery stores, at restaurants, you know, the astronauts, the flight directors, wherever it may be. And you know, it definitely does feel like a family culture out here.  Host: Wow. So, James, you talked about this era of -- you've talked about social media. You talked about this change from taking so many pictures and doing it in a different style, now having this ability to share more. What do you find is important about that and the value of that? And what kind of personal aspects do you bring to sharing these photos?  James Blair: I see our job as being the eyes for the public. We see, like you say, we see things that we've been to events that others just don't have access to. And so, it's my job to document it in a way that creates excitement and shows how exciting the space program is. So, it's, yeah, I take it as a privilege. And I try to create excitement with my imagery.  Host: Yeah. And I think you're all doing such a good job. I mean, I've had the pleasure to work with each one of you in multiple different capacities and just see, you know, you just walking around. You're there. I'm on a tour and you're there. I'm on mission control and you're there. You know it and even when I'm not there, you're there. [laughter] Like, we really appreciate what you do. And it's very significant to not just the NASA family, but to those that want to be engaged with the NASA family. So, Robert Markowitz, James Blair, Josh Valcarcel, I really appreciate your time for coming on Houston, We Have a Podcast and sharing this unique perspective that no one else has. Appreciate the time.  James Blair: Thank you.  Robert Markowitz: Thank you.  Josh Valcarcel: Thank you for the opportunity.  [ Music]  Host: Hey, thanks for sticking around. Really fascinating conversation we had with these guys today on what it's like to be a NASA photographer. I hope by now you have a deep appreciation for what they do.

                        "description": "Gary Jordan (Host): Houston, we have a podcast. Welcome to the official podcast of the NASA Johnson Space Center, Episode 151, “Rendezvous with Mars.” I'm Gary Jordan, and I'll be your host today. On this podcast we bring in the experts, scientists, engineers, astronauts all to let you know what's going on in the world of human spaceflight. We're continuing our Mars Monthly series with Patrick Chai Ph.D, who humbly requested to be referred to as an aerospace engineer at Langley Research Center in Virginia, but most would call him a rocket scientist. Patrick hones in on the challenges and needs for getting to Mars. The journey from Earth to Mars will be long, somewhere on the order of nine months. And with that, comes a series of challenges, some complicated orbital mechanics, and a whole range of options that consider things like propulsion, duration, timing, staging, and more. Yes, thanks to probes and rovers of the past we've landed on Mars, but a human landing will be like nothing else before. The transport will have to be much larger. And with humans onboard, you're limited on the kinds of routes you can take to get to Mars. Sounds like a simple consideration. Yes, of course there will be humans, but it makes things a lot harder. Buckle up everybody and all aboard to the red planet. Here we go. The challenges and range of options on how to rendezvous with Mars with Patrick Chai. Enjoy.  [ Music]  Host: Patrick, thanks so much for coming on Houston We Have a Podcast today.  Patrick Chai: Thanks for having me.  Host: This is a really interesting and intricate discussion we're going to have about what it takes to actually get to Mars. So, I might go a little bit off track. You are going to have to steer me to Mars in the right way. Tell me about your background and what got you to the path where you're thinking about Mars rendezvous?  Patrick Chai: Well, I haven't been at NASA very long. I started in the fall of 2014. I was a graduate student at Langley as well, doing some system analysis for different refueling options. So, I was a grad student. So, I got my Ph.D. from Georgia Tech. And Georgia Tech has a program at Langley associated with the National Institute of Aerospace, where grad students can, you know, be on-site there at Langley doing research with folks. And so, kind of gravitated me towards doing system analysis. So that's how I ended up applying for a job at the branch I am in, which is a space mission analysis branch. And once I started there, that's back when there was a big effort, defining what then was called the Evolvable Mars Campaign as part of President Obama's flexible path definition, you know, going to the asteroids and, you know, having multiple paths getting -- humans to Mars. So, I started doing a lot of the trajectory work for -- for the Evolvable Mars Campaign and doing the definitions of how, you know, all the different mission opportunities and how much propellant it would take if we have, you know, different payloads and things like that. So that kind of evolved into me kind of being the lead of the trajectory analysis team there for -- for all the Mars stuff and now I'm leading the Mars Integration Group here at NASA Langley. But I still want to do trajectory work because that's the most important. That's – the exciting things I like to do. Leading team is great, but it's like one of those curses, you know, you move up and become management and they don't let you do exciting work anymore [laughter].  Host: You have to delegate, delegate --  Patrick Chai: Yeah, exactly. It's hard man. Learning how to delegate is a hard thing to do.  Host: Yeah, especially when you want to do --  Patrick Chai: Exactly.  Host: You want to get your hands dirty.  Patrick Chai: Yeah.  Host: So, you mentioned, you've alluded to a few different things in your description of what you're thinking about. You're thinking about systems, you're thinking about trajectories, what are these different elements that you're considering when you're thinking how do we get to Mars?  Patrick Chai: So, you know, for what are we thinking about here. It's always, you know, sending crew to Mars right. So, we have -- we have a propulsion element that, you know, you need some sort of propulsion element to get, you know, your crew to and from Mars right, and the payload that you need to deliver. So, typically, you have a, you know, very traditionally you have a chemical stage and so, you have, you know, kind of like a regular rocket. You have, you know, fuel and oxidizer and, you know, they come into a combustion chamber and they combust and then you exhaust that out of the nozzle and that's how you push things. Right? And -- for Mars, you either pushing the Deep Space Habitat where the crew lives in or a payload which is what we call cargo, which is the lander that you need to land things on -- Mars surface.  Host: OK, so -- so you're thinking about the energy, the type of energy it takes to actually get to Mars --  Patrick Chai: Yeah.  Host: And what you're going to attach to that energy.  Patrick Chai: Yeah, and so, you know, you -- for the integrated stack, you have your propulsion elements, and you have a payload and you have to be able to get that -- all those things put together in orbit, and then you send that to Mars, and not only you have to send it to Mars, it has to have enough energy for you to come back too. So, you think about a big rocket, you know, as a reference, like a big rocket you're launching from Cape Canaveral, you know, that is very short distance that they -- it has to do comparatively to where we're needing to go to Mars. So, you can imagine the energy that it would need to go all the way to Mars, it's pretty significant.  Host: Yeah. So, what's the difference when you're thinking -- we're talking about the system level now, we're talking about what you need to actually build to get to Mars. What differs when you add the human element?  Patrick Chai: So, when you add the human element, it's kind of different, right? So, if you think about, you know, things we've sent to Mars, all the rovers and things like that, you know, those systems have a lifetime, right. But you know, it's electronics, it's -- powered by battery or solar arrays or what not, they can take a much slower route to Mars which's much more energy efficient, right. When you have a crew onboard, you have other considerations because, you know, if you have a longer duration in space, that means you have to bring more food, that means you have to bring -- you have to have a bigger space for the crew, you have to have exercise equipment for the crew. So, what -- what that actually translates to is you have more payload, you have more mass, you have to push -- you're pushing more things and that -- we call it the tyranny of the rocket equation. It's an exponential relationship. So, you add one, you know, you add one kilogram or one pound of payload. It's not equivalent to one pound of propellant. It's, you know, a much, much bigger amount. So, it can add up really quick. So, for a human mission and it'll be a little bit for the -- for the robotic too, you know, it's all about minimizing that payload mass as much as possible. And these rovers that, you know, that [Jet Propulsion Laboratory] JPL is sending to Mars, I mean, they are very slimmed down, even though they're very beefy and they're very reliable. But they are always looking for different ways to do, you know, manufacturing and fabrication of these components to minimize the weight because weight is everything in space.  Host: Yeah. Yeah, so I guess, does -- maybe this might be a ridiculous question, but does thinking about having larger systems to get to Mars change your trajectory or your possibilities of how to get there?  Patrick Chai: Um, it doesn't really change the trajectory.  Host: OK.  Patrick Chai: Maybe a little bit, but it changes the way you think about how to get to that trajectory. So, everything we've sent to Mars so far, you're thinking about these, basically, your traditional rocket, you know. And these are, you know, we're getting much, much more efficient with them, but they're very, I won't say rudimentary, but these are, you know, systems that we've -- we've been using for decades, right. And they have their limits in terms of how energy efficient, how much, you know, what we call specific impulse -- impulse that it can deliver. And specifically, we'll measure kind of the -- how much -- energy you can get out of the same amount of propellant. So, the higher you -- higher that explosive impulse is, the better your system at being efficient. So, your traditional rocket you're looking at maybe, you know, 300 to 400 seconds with a specific impulse and there's a whole, you know, derivation equations. I don't exactly know why they -- use seconds as the -- as the unit, but it falls out of the equation. But for a traditional chemical, you're looking at 300 to 400 seconds of specific impulse. And, you know, with starting to think about some of these other, you know, kind of lower thrust and higher energy propulsion systems like the solar electric propulsion or a nuclear electric propulsion systems that can get you up to, you know, 3000 to 4,000 seconds worth of specific impulse -- that increase tenfold. The drawback of that is you ended up having to stretch your in-space duration longer because it, you know, it naturally is a lower thrust propulsion system. So, that's always the battle, you have -- you have a low thrust and a high thrust system. A high thrust system kind of, you know, is a really big kick to get you out and you can do a little -- another kick to kind of slow you down at Mars. And that's relatively fast. Low thrust, you kind of -- just like putzing along, you know, for a much longer duration, but ultimately it saves you a lot of propellant. And -- it's a much more robust too, if you increase your payload mass by a significant amount. It's much more robust to be able to absorb some of that growth, so.  Host: Oh, OK, so there's a lot of different factors your considering.  Patrick Chai: Yeah. And -- what actually we have been working on in the last three, four years is actually kind of marrying the two. We've been working on what we call a hybrid propulsion system. And it's kind of -- it has both components. It has a high thrust and a low thrust system. So, you use the high thrust when you're near -- planets where they are actually most effective. And -- you know, because you're -- you have to, you know, no matter what, you -- have a long duration transit out to Mars and back anyway. So, you might as well use some of that time to do some thrusting and do some maneuvering. And we've -- we found that the system that we've kind of, you know, been analyzing has some advantages and some disadvantages, but that's how all this -- and that's important, I think, from, you know, what we -- what we always harp on from our -- branch, the system analysis -- analysis perspective. We have to be able to understand the behavior of the system. Especially under uncertainty and under changing requirements in order to understand what you're actually selecting. You can't just say, oh, because we have this very, very tiny optimized point design, we're going to select this -- this propulsion option. Well, what if your design changes a little bit, you know, how sensitive you are -- your system is to that change, and we need to have a better understanding of all that before we make -- before we're able to make really informed decisions.  Host: So, I mean, a hybrid approach sounds very reasonable because you're considering the -- flexibility, naturally when it comes to spaceflight with flexibility comes mass. Now you're talking about two different propulsion systems.  Patrick Chai: Yeah, actually, it's -- it's kind of -- yeah, you know, it's actually less in terms of mass. It's more on the complexity side.  Host: Interesting.  Patrick Chai: In terms of mass, like, you know, given the same payload and the propulsion system, it depends on the trajectory you fly. The chemical is going to be the heaviest, and then the full [Electric Propulsion] EP up is going to be the lightest. But, you know, you trade time with that too, right? You know, the -- the big rocket will get there -- get you there the fastest, but the slow boat electric propulsion will get there, you know, much slower. So, we're trying to, you know -- so like, for instance, we have some planetary probes that are flying out there that uses electric propulsion, and then they've been very successful in doing that. But, you know, these things take years and years to get to wherever they're going. And so, it's great for the -- for the planetary probe, you know, because they don't really care about, you know, how long it takes to get there as long as they get there and do the science they need to do. But when you have crew onboard, you can't really use that as consideration, right? Because you have to -- you can't just say, oh, we're going to have, you know, we're going to take three years just to get to Mars one way, right. It's -- you know, it's a nonstarter because all the food and everything you have to bring. Unless we can figure out how to cryo-freeze people, I guess [laughter]. That would be a different ballgame [laughter].  Host: Wow. I mean, this -- that's one of the key elements here, we're talking about sending humans to Mars. And that -- with that you -- one of the requirements is -- is speed.  Patrick Chai: Yeah.  Host: You need to get there faster.  Patrick Chai: Yeah, you need to get there, you know, in a reasonable amount of time before all your consumables and things like that run out, right. Or you have to bring so much that you never even get started. Right.  Host: Yeah.  Patrick Chai: And so that's always the challenge, right? Because you -- you know, with exploring, I always use kind of the analogy of Christopher Columbus sailing across the Atlantic Ocean, right. When they leave, they had -- there was -- there was no expectation that they have any sort of, you know, stoppage and things like that on, you know, during the voyage, right.  Host: Yeah.  Patrick Chai: And so, they're hoping that, you know, fingers crossed that they can get all the way to wherever they're going and resupply, so they are planning however long they -- were planning to sail. And, you know, at least -- the good news for us is that at least we know where we're -- our destination instead of going sailing into the unknown. But to kind of, you know, give you some context, I mean, Columbus sailed in, you know, the late 1400s. And they got to the -- I think the first trip they left the Spanish coast and got to, I think the Bahamas. That, you know, was like 6,500 kilometers worth of distance they traveled, you know, across the Atlantic Ocean in like 30 something days. If -- if you use that same distance they traveled as, you know, if you -- if you say, OK, that's the same distance that you know, from Earth to Mars. The Moon, which is the furthest humans has ever been, is only two and a half miles off the coast.  Host: Oh.  Patrick Chai: So, give you some scale [laughter]. So, on all human existence, we've only gone two and a half miles off of the Spanish coast.  Host: Wow.  Patrick Chai: And we're trying to get across the Atlantic Ocean to the new world.  Host: Yeah.  Patrick Chai: And trying to plan for that. And -- and so that -- that kind of gives you that scale. And I think people, you know, think oh yeah, we -- you know, we -- because we sent probes, you know, and things like that it should be easy, but it's -- it's not at all because it's -- one of the most -- I think fundamentally the most challenging things. That's why we've been looking at it for -- since the Apollo time, right. Because it is that challenging.  Host: Well, tell me a little bit more about what -- what is so challenging about it when it comes to the orbital mechanics of it all that -- how you're limited with your opportunities, how, you know, you can't really turn around.  Patrick Chai: Yeah, so we are, you know, very much governed by what, you know, the mechanics and the gravity and -- I struggle a lot, you know, talking to just, you know, people, you know, like my family and things like that, like what I do, it's not easy to like, have them understand that. So, I like to use the -- the train analogy and, you know, imagine like, you have -- you know, miniature train sets or big train sets -- I don't really want to know what you want to play with. But, you know, Earth and Mars are moving around the sun, like -- like they are on train tracks, you know, circular or ellipsoid train tracks, right. So, it's spinning around, but they're moving at different speed. Right? So, your goal of getting from one to the other is you're -- you're standing on one of the train track -- on the trains, you know, moving with the train, and you're trying to throw an egg across to -- and have it land on the other train without it breaking. Right? And so -- so it's all -- it's not only do you have to like have enough energy to throw it. You also have to have enough energy to slow it down so that -- when it lands -- when it gets to the train, it doesn't, you know, just splatter, right. That's kind of like a basic analogy of how you, you know, what it takes. So, you can think about, you know, imagine like, if the trains are on, you know, opposite ends of the circle, right? You know, they're not in sync, right?  Host: Yeah.  Patrick Chai: You're not going to be able to, you know -- you could, it would just take a lot more energy to throw and to -- you know, and slow down, right. And so you -- you're -- basically what we're doing with Mars in terms of mission opportunities is that we're waiting for the trains to kind of align itself to the proper, you know, proper orientations for us to kind of maximize the use of the velocity, the speed of our train, and maximize the speed, you know, on arrival of, you know, the Mars train kind of.  Host: Yeah, what you're trying to do is you're trying to limit how, how hard you have to throw this egg.  Patrick Chai: Right, you -- how hard you have to throw there, and you have to limit how hard you have to push back when -- when you get to Mars. I remember seeing -- it was a great video that Mythbusters did where they had a cannon strapped to the back of a truck and then they drove it at 50 miles an hour and they shot the cannon off the back and it kind of just fell on the ground.  Host: I saw that one. Yeah.  Patrick Chai: You're basically doing that at Mars, right? And because you want to kind of just like be the same relative velocity. Because you're moving fast compared to Mars, right? And you have to fire engines, you know, fire a rocket, your cannon, the other way to kind of slow down and drop in Mars. So, you want to minimize that as well, because that's all, you know, we call it delta V, change in velocity. And that drives how much propellant you need. That drives how much your -- your propulsion system has to be in terms of, you know, thrust and size, and all that and it kind of snowballs into this giant vehicle that you have to take to Mars. So then, you know, minimizing that is the goal, right? And that's why we have very -- these -- these very what we call conjunction style trajectory that kind of minimizes that energy.  Host: OK, so how often do those opportunities come up?  Patrick Chai: Typically, the Earth/Mars synodic cycle is about 26 months, so every 26-ish month, you get one of those opportunities. That's why, you know, for JPL, their rovers, they launch every two-ish years or so. So, this one, we have Mars 2020 now coming up this year, the last one was launched in 2018. So that's kind of the cycle that we have. Every 26 months or so we have these kind of conjunction opportunities.  Host: Now, is there a factor you have to add into this whenever you're looking at these opportunities for the fact that humans are going to be on this vehicle and that you're going to have to return at some point?  Patrick Chai: Well, yeah, that's always -- that's always the trick, right? People always think, you know, oh, one way, right. No, we have the, you know, it's -- it's a round trip. So, back to the train analogy. You know, once you get to Mars, you, you know, in order to minimize the energy coming home, you have to kind of again, wait for the train to kind of get back into the proper alignment for you to come home. So typically, a conjunction style full round-trip mission, you're, on average about 180 to 260 days, maybe up to 300 days, you know, out to Mars transit time. And you stay on the surface or stay at Mars for 300 to 500 days waiting for the planet to realign and then you come home on the same low minimum energy trajectory. So yeah, so you have a whole round trip about three years is typical, very, very typical. Now with different technology, high and low thrusts, those duration do fluctuate here and there a little bit. But typically, you're looking at 900 to, you know, 1100 days of total, what we call time away from Earth, because that's, you know, the days start counting when you push the button to leave Earth.  Host: Yeah.  Patrick Chai: There might be more time the crew has to spend near Earth to, you know, they have to launch, they have to get into the spacecraft. And get everything checked out before they can even do that. So, you have to kind of back that out even further to, you know, to get all the total crew time in space, which may be a little -- little more maybe 100 days more than -- then when the total Mars mission. Some opportunities, mission opportunities are a little shorter, some are longer because the Earth and Mars orbit are not perfectly circular around the sun. So, they do have variations in the -- in the distance. So, some take a little longer, some a little faster -- sometimes a little faster. So yeah, a lot -- a lot to kind of, there's just a lot of variability and -- and we have to -- we do have to take that into consideration. Because we've -- we've had -- we've gone into some, you know, bad rabbit holes and oh, you know, this mission opportunity is really, really easy. Let's design to that. Well, if you do that, then if you miss it, you can't go ever again, or you can't go for 20 years.  Host: You have to have some flexibility --  Patrick Chai: Right. Exactly.  Host: Design your system is to meet these different --  Patrick Chai: Yeah. And there's one of the things that we harp is, is we need to be robust with -- with our design, because we understand that whatever we plan, there's always a risk of slippage, like schedule slippage.  Host: Yeah.  Patrick Chai: And -- we need to be robust to that. And that's a challenge, right? Because you're already designing -- designing a system that is, you know, at the hairy edge of the performance, and you're trying to get everything out of the system, you -- you already can, and if you try to build in robust into that, you know, it's -- it's a challenge, because it ends up being really big and bigger than it needs to be for -- you know, it's always the, you know, in every system analysis, and even aerospace -- actually not just aerospace, but engineering in general, there's this debate of robustness versus optimization, right. You know, optimizing, you know, onto the very, very, you know, you know -- being able to optimize to something versus being robust to changes, and then that -- battle is always been an ongoing, so.  Host: Yeah, because optimization is equal to efficiency, but robustness is equal to reliability.  Patrick Chai: Right. Yeah, exactly. So, you know -- and there's a balance to that. You can't, you know, go full bore on one way or the other. Right. And so, yeah, you know, you could theoretically design a vehicle to fly every single mission opportunity. But that's not realistic, right? Because you wouldn't end up -- you will be so unoptimized for every single opportunity that yeah, that you end up with a system that doesn't necessarily closes from other programmatic perspective.  Host: What a challenge. Oh my gosh.  Patrick Chai: Yeah.  Host: Now, what about launch opportunities, you know, launch slips happen all the time.  Patrick Chai: Right.  Host: It's just a regular part of spaceflight.  Patrick Chai: Yeah. So -- so that -- that is the other challenge that we talked to, you know, we talked a little bit about the additional time that you need to account for, right. So, you know, so if you know your -- your launch -- your Earth departure date, right, is certain, you know, to maximize your mission opportunity, you're going to plan for the launch slippage, right? So instead of saying, OK, the crew is launching three days before that Earth departure date, you're going to have to launch -- you're going to have to plan to launch your crew a month, two months before that, that way if this slips you can have that -- and we have a -- we have some folks in the agency who's done some fantastic work on -- launch reliability, and they've done, you know, some great analysis to show, you know, in order to get to a 99% probability of actually getting you to this particular date you have to backtrack and figure out how much -- how many days you need to plan to -- to launch. The launch window, basically.  Host: Yeah.  Patrick Chai: So, it's -- it's a little different than like saying going to the ISS or even back then the Apollo program where, you know, a little slippage, you end up -- you can -- you know, the lunar cycle is only 28 days, right? And so, if you miss that magical opportunity, it's -- you wait a month, and it's --  Host: You wait a month?  Patrick Chai: It's not you wait 28 months, or 26 months, right? So, it's, yeah, you have to be robust in that. But there's a limit to that, right? And because you don't want to say, OK, we're launching our crew six months in advance, and they sit around in orbit waiting for their opportunity to go.  Host: Right.  Patrick Chai: Right. And that's -- that's unrealistic. So, it's -- it's, again, back to optimize versus robust, this is the risk versus, you know, how risky you want to -- want to be right. Is your -- is a 99th percentile probability good enough? Is 90th? Is 70th? I don't know, right? That's something that, you know, it's -- a challenge for both engineers and the program managers to understand the risk and understand where we can absorb the risk and where we can't.  Host: Yeah. So, what you're doing is you're -- you're thinking about this -- this wide spectrum of possibilities. You're thinking about how early do we have to launch? And how -- how long is it reasonable for the crew to hang out in low-Earth orbit until they take that Mars injection burn and go to Mars?  Patrick Chai: Right.  Host: What's reasonable there? What are the propulsion technologies that we can consider and what factors into that kind of design? You're just thinking about this whole thing.  Patrick Chai: Yeah, and it's a -- it's an integrated system and campaigns look, right. And that's -- that's more so than just doing like the individual design for systems. And the other, you know, throw you another wrench [laughter]. You know, the longer you wait in orbit, the more your systems degrade, you -- you might have propellant which are cryogenically -- or cryogenic temperatures so they might be boiling off. So you have to top it off, and there's a whole host of discussions and -- on that and that's why there's, you know, there's some discussion about different orbits where you do your -- do your aggregation, different orbits where you do your rendezvous and things like that so that it's -- it's not -- LEO, the lower -- LEO lower-Earth orbit is great because you can throw a lot of stuff into it from a launch vehicle perspective because it's lower. But it's a terrible environment for a spacecraft to hang out long term, especially big spacecraft. The thermal environment is pretty harsh from all of the -- the radiation from coming -- actually reflecting off the Earth from a thermal perspective is not -- not great, but it's also a lot of orbital debris because all the stuff that's up there, so there's a higher chance of that. The benefit is that you're still in the radiation -- in the radiation belt so you're shielded from that. So there's -- there's a trade, you know, if you want to go higher orbit, which is sometimes our preference because you can get out of the thermal environment, you can see out of the -- the overall debris environment, but -- but you take the hit on the radiation for some of your system. But the benefit is that since we're designing a system to go to Mars, all of that system has to be radiation rated and protected anyway, so it's not a huge issue with the exception of solar panels, which do degrade in radiation environment. So, you don't want that to sit in the radiation environment for too long or else it degrades so that you can't generate enough power.  Host: So, where are some of those higher orbits that we're considering?  Patrick Chai: So, we've been talking a lot about orbits around the Moon -- yeah, orbits around the Moon. The Honors Program is you know, with the -- with the Gateway had -- is out there in a -- in a near rectilinear Halo orbit around the Moon. We have these Lagrangian points that a lot of folks are very interested in understanding and -- and what -- what those points really are is you think about from gravity, you know, pulling each other at the Earth and the Moon are in a gravitational pull system. So, the Lagrangian points are just points in the Earth/Moon system that are -- that the gravity between the Earth and the Moon is relatively equal. So, you're not really being pulled by the Earth, you're -- you're being pulled by Earth and the Moon roughly equally. And so those are -- those are points of interest because it's a -- you know, once you get into those points, you know, it's easy to kind of get out of them. And so, you know, if you have a bunch of stuff stacked there, it doesn't cost a lot of energy for it to go -- to leave that orbit again to go somewhere else. And so it's great for our aggregating a lot of -- a lot of things and so, for, you know, what we've been looking at last couple years, with the assumption is always that we would launch all of our elements and components into that, you know, kind of like, we call it -- we just call it cislunar orbit, lunar orbit, just to be generic because we haven't really picked a particular orbit that we want to be in. It could be the same one that the Gateway is at that way we can have some synergy with that program.  Host: Right.  Patrick Chai: But we aggregate all that stuff there. But before Earth departure, you don't really want to depart from that particular orbit. Because you do --  Host: Lagrangian linear --  Patrick Chai: Yeah.  Host: -- Orbit? OK.  Patrick Chai: You don't want to -- you could depart from those, you know, those Lagrangian orbits but you have -- you get a much more benefit from the Earth's gravity if you're leaving from a, you know, Earth orbiting gravity or Earth orbiting orbit. So, basically, what you want to do is you want to come back and kind of swing by the Earth on your way out, that would be much more efficient to be able to do that. So, the assumption is always we come back to a high-Earth orbit. We call lunar distance high-Earth orbit. So, it's a big, big orbit that comes by the Earth and it comes -- when it goes out -- so orbits are always defined by perigee and apogee, a perigee that is closest to the main body and apogee is the distance furthest away. So, your perigee is close to the Earth, but your apogee is actually at lunar distance. So, a lot of our trajectory we -- we've actually been doing a lot of analysis and building a lot of these very intricate trajectory for -- for how we do Earth departure. To try to minimize the energy we need. Right? Typically, you know, when you do your -- what we call the Trans-Mars injection burn so burning for Mars, you come by Earth and you fire on your -- your rocket engine and you burn really hard and you -- you kick out there, which is great and it's fast, but it takes a lot of energy, takes a lot of propellant. So, we're -- you know, when designing our hybrid low and high thrust combination type of propulsion system, we're trying to minimize how much of that chemical burn that we have to do. So, we would design up these pretty intricate trajectories in which we come back into this higher Earth orbit, where the apogee is at lunar distance, and we phase it so that after the crew gets onboard the spacecraft, we target the Moon, we do a lunar flyby and -- and that kicks us out to heliocentric space.  Host: Oh interesting.  Patrick Chai: And then that gives us enough energy to go out. And that -- this only really works for the -- hybrid because technically once you get flung out by the Moon, you don't have enough energy to get to Mars yet. But with the low thrust you can then use the time you have in space to thrust and to kind of keep pushing and pushing harder, and harder, harder for you to catch up to Mars.  Host: OK, so this Moon slingshot thing works only if you have the high -- the solar electric propulsion.  Patrick Chai: Yeah, electric propulsion.  Host: Give you the extra boost.  Patrick Chai: Yeah. So, and because -- yeah, or else, you know, this orbit, if you just slingshot around the Moon you don't have any more propulsion, you eventually fall back into Earth in little like -- like maybe like a year later you catch back on Earth again. But so, you -- you go on a little tour of the -- of the Earth orbits area but you don't -- yeah, you don't -- you're not really going anywhere particularly -- in particular, so.  Host: Yeah, so -- so that brings up a good point. So, let's say for whatever reason you do that Mars or that Moon slingshot, but your solar electric propulsion doesn't kick in. Now, you got to swing back. You're hanging out in space for a year.  Patrick Chai: Yeah. Yeah, that's always the challenge.  Host: Right.  Patrick Chai: Well, you know, there is this quote unquote, “abort.\" I think people, you know, like, you know, not their fault. Like, when people say, abort, you know, everybody have a good understanding what that is, right? Because we have all these abort scenarios, like, you know, oh, you're coming back home pretty quickly, and things like that. But yeah, man, when you're in heliocentric space it's -- it's not that simple. It's -- and it's -- it takes a lot of energy to come -- to turn around and burn home. For your -- kind of like a low thrust, you just do a lunar gravity assist. Let's say your scenario, your electric propulsion system just craps out and doesn't do anything. The benefit is that you still have your chemical propulsion system. So, you could theoretically -- and you're not -- you're -- in terms of your overall energy, you're not that far from Earth. We haven't really done the analysis to understand how quickly you can get back. That's really, really dependent on the orbit of the particular date you're looking at, and things like that. But we do have some analysis done on the high thrust side of things, you know, after you do your big burn can you -- you know, I guess in those scenarios is like, oh, if a crew has some issues and need to come home, how -- what are the options, right? And, honestly, it's pretty limited, even with like, you know, this is one of the benefits of -- people have touted for the nuclear thermal propulsion system which has is -- it's kind of like a -- it's kind of like the chemical but instead of combustion in the -- using the propellant, you're using a nuclear reactor to, you know, heat up the fuel and expand it out. So, it has a higher specific impulse. But you have to carry a nuclear reactor around which has its own challenges. But they talk about these abort scenarios because -- because it has the efficiency that -- that the chemical system doesn't have, but that's still, you know, once you kick out and especially those high thrust trajectory, you're much, much higher energy. So, in order for you to turn around and burn back this -- burn back towards Earth, it's not a straight shot, you know, it's not like me, you know, doing a U turn and coming home. There's -- there's no -- U turn really to be done. You almost have to burn enough so that you fly by -- you do a really close swing by of the sun and come back and catch back up on Earth -- with Earth again, and that -- that could take you know, a year or so, or six months. Depending on when that burn happens, so the challenge we've always had when -- when these type of questions come up is, in what scenario do you have a crew, I guess, crew health situation where, you know, the full, you know, Mars mission three years round trip is not acceptable, but a six months, one year return is acceptable, right? What -- what scenario are you thinking about? Because, you know, I always say, I don't know what the scenario is, right.  Host: Yeah.  Patrick Chai: And so that's -- that's the I think that -- and it's important to have that discussion. Because we need to understand where these questions are coming from, and the people's concerns about -- about all this and understanding, like the scenarios in which they want to protect for and this is, again, back to the risk thing, right? If we want to protect for certain scenarios, we can run the analysis to show what it would cost, right and then it's up to the decision maker to, you know, weigh the cost benefit analysis. Say do we want to protect for this one or not? What are the probability of this actually happening? And -- we from a system analysis perspective need to show, you know, OK, if you want to protect for this risk here are the implications and how that -- you know, how that system change impacts the rest of the other systems that are related, right.  Host: Yeah. This goes back to what you're thinking about, which is this wide range of possibilities. Thinking about propulsion technology, when you're thinking about possible trajectories or in the orbital mechanics of it all, how to design a mission profile, however long it may be. That's a, you know, they're all worthy discussions to have. But I think we're -- really what it comes down to is a mission to Mars is a risk, you know, like --  Patrick Chai: Yeah, absolutely.  Host: You can't make it risk free.  Patrick Chai: Yeah, absolutely.  Host: That would be amazing, but it's just not the way it is.  Patrick Chai: Yeah. It's like going skydiving, right.  Host: Yeah.  Patrick Chai: There's some inherent risk in that and there's nothing you can do to remove all the risk, right? And so, we can sit here and talk about, you know -- and engineering design system to be as risk free as possible, but it will not be zero percent risk, right? I mean, inherently, I mean, just getting on the rocket and going into space is probably the riskiest part of you know -- could be one of the riskiest part of the whole endeavor. Right? And so, at some point, we are -- we will -- we have to be willing to take risk, right. And I think one of the challenges we have as an agency, especially when it comes to the Mars program, is that number one, it's -- it's so challenging, right, we've kind of established how difficult it is. So, we need to have these hard discussions about risk, and cost, and schedule, and programmatics, and things like that. But -- but it's -- it's also double challenging because it's so far away always it seems like.  Host: Yeah.  Patrick Chai: Right? It's hard to make decisions now, the hard decisions that might not have impact till 10, 15 years down the road.  Host: Let's talk about the Moon to Mars. What we're -- what we're striving for right now.  Patrick Chai: Yeah.  Host: You already mentioned a little bit about the Artemis program and what we can learn about the near rectilinear Halo orbit and some of the technologies needed for Gateway. What will that help inform when it comes to some of these propulsion technologies and some of the ways that we're thinking about how the Moon can help us get to Mars?  Patrick Chai: Yeah, from the propulsions perspective, I mean, that's one of the benefit, right, what -- you know, for the -- you know, what we -- what we've been looking at the -- the sub cam hybrid is that the electric propulsion thrusters that we are, you know, that we're planning on potentially using for Mars transit is -- being planned for the Gateway as well. Right. And so, there are some synergy there. And there's some, you know, obviously, there's -- will be some challenges with the development cycle because the power level is totally different, right? But there's, you know, you kind of draw a little family tree back up to that -- that particular design. I think the big thing for the Artemis program is kind of how the private -- private public partnership is kind of, you know, unfolding in front of our eyes. I think getting kind of the framework for this -- for this private public partnership as part of the Artemis program, understanding how we can leverage a lot of things that are happening in the -- in the industry -- in the private sector, can really inform and really drive how we think about designing the mission and think about how we either procure or leverage all the things that are happening and, you know, obviously the private industry have quite different objectives compared to what the government and NASA wants to do. We want to explore, we want to, you know, expand our knowledge and -- really drive and push the technological boundaries. And so that part is -- has to be the forefront of what we -- try to plan for. And I think we are. But I think the industry in terms of their push for innovation in areas that the government might not be interested in is also very beneficial because they are very interested in streamlining the manufacturing process, being more efficient with their design cycle and -- how robust their systems are in the way they do their testing.  Host: So, a lot we can learn from the commercial way of operating things --  Patrick Chai: Yeah.  Host: Implementing commercial partnership.  Patrick Chai: Yeah, you know, just under -- having synergy with a lot of things they're doing and leveraging some of the stuff they're -- leverage -- having just -- just dialogue and just understanding how they're doing their, you know, business model, if you want to call it and how we can learn from that, right, and change the way we're doing testing and doing developments and things like that. You know, in all industry and in tech in particular, you know, you need to have these kind of breakthrough and these industry kind of breaking, you know, moments, right, and to kind of drive us out of these kinds of complacency that we're in. And, you know, at some point, we got to decide, yeah, we got -- we want to go to Mars, and we want to be able to do certain things, and we just have to, you know, push for it.  Host: Yeah. So, it's that there is a balance I feel between innovation, you know, trying new things and doing things a certain way and maybe the tradition does have a certain benefit of precedence.  Patrick Chai: Yeah.  Host: It informs what is possible because --  Patrick Chai: As long as we learn from our history, and we, you know, we learn from the mistakes we've -- made, right. You know, I struggle with that every day, you know, make sure that I think this way, is it because I'm being informed by data and -- and I'm being informed by -- by good sound analysis, or am I, you know, leaning this way because of my, you know, inherent bias or inherent perception or preconceived notion of what the system is. Right?  Host: Yeah.  Patrick Chai: And that struggle is -- is, you know, is -- real at all levels. And that's something that we have to be kind of very cognizant of.  Host: Yeah. So when you're thinking about solving these problems with team members, finding a way to think efficiently and making sure that you're considering all of these different things, but not getting too bogged down by these decisions, that -- that's a balance just in and of itself, not just -- not just designing these trajectories and thinking about these systems, but coming to a consensus on how to proceed.  Patrick Chai: Yeah, absolutely. And, you know, it's great that we, you know, our branch in particular have had, you know, every, you know, year or so, we get one or two new hires, and we have a bunch of interns that come in. So, it's always great when they come in with fresh perspective. They have not been in the mud, you know, making these trajectories or analysis and things like that. So, they come in and say, “wait, why did you do it that way?” And we go, “yeah, why did we do it that way?” And we need that, right? Because, you know, you don't want to end up in a -- in a kind of an environment in which new people coming in, you know, are conforming, you know, you -- they're expected to conform to whatever standard you have. You want them to come in with a fresh mind, with critical view and to provide us with a different perspective. And that's, I think, the most valuable thing we have, especially here at NASA because of, you know, our notoriety and people want to come to work at NASA and it's a great thing. And we need to keep hiring, we need to keep these people coming in and young minds and -- and really get them engaged, not just in school, but you know, before. So, I think a lot of the public outreach things that we do is extremely important. I think NASA is still one of the most sought-after thing. People say, oh, you work in NASA? That's amazing. And -- and it is. You know, I'm thrilled to go to work every day. And -- and we need that kind of enthusiasm, you know, to continue for -- and people coming in are, you know, they're brilliant. And you need to be -- make sure that we are doing the right thing and doing -- doing things that, you know, to make them feel like they're empowered to change the status quo.  Host: Yeah. So thinking about what we've discussed today, thinking about the difficulties of rendezvousing with Mars, and with the different technologies that we're considering, reaching out to those people who want to come work at NASA and -- and fight to innovate and fight to change the way that things are doing, what are -- what is the message that you want to send to them?  Patrick Chai: It's -- you know, it is a very exciting time, right, because -- because we have this whole Moon/Mars enterprise now, the Honors Program is spinning up and we are going to, you know, go to the surface of the Moon to -- to do some very exciting science and with the goal on the horizon of always going to Mars. So, these systems that we are developing and partnering with, you know, industry partners to develop are going to set -- lay the foundation for what we do at Mars, right. And so, it's very important for us to not only do the mission to the Moon, but also be very, very cognizant of that these are laying the stepping stones. So, we need to learn as much as we can, as we do these things, to inform all the things that we're going to be planning on doing when we, you know, build a spacecraft to go Mars, right. And so, I think it's -- it's a very exciting time for NASA.  Host: Well, it's an exciting time. And the future is -- is exciting, because I think every year is just going to be -- is another step closer.  Patrick Chai: Yeah. And -- and, you know, like I said, I think throughout this podcast is it's a challenging problem and it is probably one of the -- one of humanity's greatest challenge, you know, and I think if there's a will we, you know, I don't doubt that we can achieve it. But it is a challenge and -- and we have some of the brightest people on the planet trying to solve it. And, you know, it's a great thing, and it's -- it's something that, you know, I think it's going to be so rewarding for all of humanity. It's one of those, you know, you think about what people talk about, you know, well what does NASA do besides sending people to space? We do these innovations that we have to develop so that we can send people to Mars. They will have a long-lasting effect on our society. And we might not know what that is till years later, but it will. And that's kind of the challenge from a \"PR perspective\", right? You know what, you know, costing X amount of dollars to send people to Mars. So, what does that, you know, we could spend that money here on Earth, but it's like, you don't know what you're going to get out of it. But we know that it's going to be impactful because we have -- we have a track record of -- of all the great things that have spun off from NASA technologies that we've, you know, came out of the lunar program and the space station program. Right? And the Mars program will be an exponential in terms of how challenging it is, right? We're only two and a half miles off the coast of Spain right now. We're going all the way to America, right? And so, they will -- whatever we come up with in terms of solutions and technology advancement will be, I think societal changing.  Host: Yeah. Well, I'm glad you're on the team thinking about this [laughter]. And looking forward to bringing on others to continue it. It's going – it’s been great work. And this has been a fascinating conversation. Patrick, thanks so much for coming on.  Patrick Chai: Thank you very much for having me. Yeah, it's been great.  Host: Awesome.  [ Music]  Host: Hey, thanks for sticking around. Really fascinating conversation we had with rocket scientist extraordinaire, Patrick Chai. I hope you've been enjoying some of these Mars Monthly episodes. We started with Michelle Rucker, and just the general concept and really the outline of a mission to Mars. Then we explored some “Concepts Near Science Fiction” with Jason Derleth. Patrick Chai takes us into the third month. I hope you're sticking around, we got a lot more episodes coming your way. Again, we're going to do it on the first Fridays of every month. So, stay tuned for some of the upcoming episodes. If you liked this episode, or many of the other Mars Monthly episodes of Houston We Have a Podcast, you can find them all at NASA.gov/podcast, you can also check out some of our other episodes, you really don't have to listen to them in any particular order.

                        "description": "Gary Jordan (Host): Houston, we have a Birthday! Welcome to the official podcast of the NASA Johnson Space Center, Episode 152, “The Best of Year Three.” I'm Gary Jordan and I'll be kicking off this discussion today. Three years ago, this week, we launched the first episode of Houston We Have a Podcast. We've brought in so many scientists, engineers, astronauts, to talk about a huge variety of topics, and share some incredible stories. We're celebrating another great year of Houston We Have a Podcast. This time we're bringing in the entire podcast team and putting them in front of the mics to talk about some of our favorite moments from the past year of episodes. Today, I'm sitting down with producer and audio wizard, Alex Perryman, as well as producer and host, Pat Ryan. We're also bringing in Norah Moran, who prepares each episode for the web and shares them with the world. We're also bringing in Belinda Pulido who prepares the transcript for each episode and does a more than fantastic job of making the episode understandable by all. We have Jennifer Hernandez, a fellow public affairs officer, who also helps in producing and promoting. She was even a co-host on one of our most recent episodes. And of course, Dan Huot, who helped kick the whole thing off. Now, I wanted to bring in the whole podcast team, but we're all recording from home, so you're going to hear it on Microsoft Teams. It's going to sound a little bit different from how we usually do it, but I hope you'll stay tuned. If you're new to the show, this will give you a nice snapshot of some of the conversations we've had so far. Happy Birthday to us. Let's jump right ahead to reminiscing with the podcast team. Enjoy.  [ Music]  [ Applause]  Host: We did it guys. Another year down. I cannot believe we have been doing this for three years. It has been such an honor to be working with every, single one of you. I'm glad you can all be here. This is the first time we have the entire podcast team. I wanted to bring you guys on to celebrate and to also just introduce you, because a lot of you, yes have been on some of the previous anniversary episodes, but this is a lot of the times for some of our listeners, that you'll -- actually, it'll be the first time that a lot of them get to actually hear your voices. So, I'm glad to be doing this. But first, we've got to kick it off to the audio wizard herself, Alex Perryman. How are you? How has this past year been? [Applause] Alex Perryman: This past year -- thank you for that lone applause. This past year has been very interesting for the wizard, but it's been a lot of fun. Just the new episodes that we got to do, the new editing techniques that I was doing, just all of that, it's been great this year.  Host: So, Alex talk a little about --  Dan Huot: Don't forget her newfound TikTok stardom.  Host: Yes, that's right. Alex, tell us a little bit about yourself and your newfound fame.  Alex Perryman: About me. So, I've been working at NASA for almost four years now as an audio engineer. Do everything from live TV to this podcast here when it comes to audio. And during the, what we call the “Quarantine Fame,” I became pretty popular on TikTok. So, it's about 11K strong right now.  Host: Congratulations. That's awesome. And you are the audio wizard. You've been with us since the very beginning. We've been doing this for three years, seen a lot of stuff, and you're the audio wizard for those who have not heard the story, because of your insane audio abilities and your ability to resurrect audio files from the quote unquote, \"dead.\" So, happy to have you as part of the team, Alex.  Alex Perryman: So happy to be here.  Host: Alright, next is Pat Ryan. Podcast producer extraordinaire, and the velvety baritone voice. Pat, how are you?  Pat Ryan: I'm good. I'm good. But you know, working for Alex Perryman, there's no way it can be bad.  Host: Tell us a little bit about what you do for the podcast and for NASA.  Pat Ryan: I am a producer and writer in -- for the Public Affairs Office, and working on a variety of things, including producing the podcast and serving as the backup interviewer on occasion. That's the short answer.  Host: Well, it is -- it's been wonderful to have you, Pat. I don't think I could do this without you, because it's just this podcast has grown, and we have so many different topics. We are at, what is this? This is 152.  Pat Ryan: Yes.  Host: A hundred and fifty-two episodes. I just -- you know, I couldn’t do it without you. So, I'm glad to have you as part of the team.  Pat Ryan: Well, that's nice of you to say, although I know you have done it without me, so that's a good thing, though. And it's good to point out that this podcast -- with the exception of the time that the federal government was shut down, this podcast has posted every, single week. Never missed a week.  Host: Very proud of that and all thanks for your help. Thank you very much. Alright, here's a voice that you've maybe heard I think once on the podcast, last year for the anniversary. She was the one taking photos of our anniversary episode. We got her to say, \"Hey.\" But, here's Norah Moran. You've heard her voice at the end of most of the episodes for the past, at least, year and a half. Norah, welcome.  Norah Moran: Hi. So, yes, I've been working on the podcast now for I think a year and a half. And I wear a few different hats here at NASA. I'm a photographer, so I work with the NASA photo team that did a podcast here. Those guys are my coworkers, but I also work over here with all of you guys doing social media stuff. I do all the ISS social media postings and for the podcast particularly, I put together all of the NASA.gov webpage posts. And all the subsequent posting, and I make all of the thumbnails, and sort of put it all altogether. I used to do all of the transcripts as well, but then Belinda came along to help me out, which has been awesome. Made my job a lot easier.  Host: Norah, you do a lot for the podcast, and I was really nervous that after your year with us that you were going to move on to different things, and you did such a good job, I'm glad you were able to stick with us and continue to post. You've been doing really good. All the thumbnails, all the unique links. There's been a lot of instances, even this past year, where we've just had very unique episodes. I think one of my favorites in particular was, \"The View from Above.\" That was one that Pat hosted, but it was an integrated, audio podcast, but if you go to the webpage, you can actually follow along through the imagery journey that our guest, Will Stefanov, was taking us through, and follow along. And that was all thanks to you putting that together. So, Norah, you've been doing great. It's been an honor to have you.  Norah Moran: Thank you. It's been really fun to be on this team.  Host: Please don't go away. And next is Belinda. Norah, you mentioned Belinda. Belinda, you have been an incredible asset to this team. I think the transcripts have significantly improved since I remember I was doing them, in the very beginning. But you take a lot of time and your very detail oriented, and it's been great. So, Belinda, tell us a little bit about your contribution to the podcast, and a little of what you do.  Belinda Pulido: Yes. Hi, I'm Belinda. And I have been part of the team since September of last year. So, a little less than a year. It's been a great experience overall. I've gained so much science, NASA knowledge working on the transcripts weekly. My job is to go over the transcripts, as I mentioned. And all I do is like basically do fact-checking, acronym research among other items throughout the week. And I have helped also in guest coordination, which has been amazing. And I've also been part of other projects across NASA. I started as an intern, and was lucky enough to still, you know, to stay and work around the multimedia spectrum. And I've been here for two years now. Time flies. And this team is like a family to me. We all get along really well, and we work really well as a team. Yes, so I definitely look forward to each week, for working on the show and just working with this amazing team. It's been a great almost one year with you guys.  Host: Belinda, that means so much. It's been an honor to have you, really. You do an excellent job and I also look forward to this meeting. I try to make it fun, and we always come up with unique ideas. And to Pat's point, we haven't really missed a week. So, and that's all thanks to you guys contributing and putting forth so much effort to actually make it possible. So, Belinda, thank you for being a part of this team.  Belinda Pulido: Thank you. I'm happy to be here.  Host: Alright, now I'll introduce our newest member, but I feel like Jennifer, you've been a part of the team for a while, and you've contributed already so much, even co-hosting, and a number of other things. Jennifer Hernandez, welcome. Tell us a little bit about yourself.  Jennifer Hernandez: Well, hey Gary. Thank you so much. I think -- well, first of all, I'm a freshly minted Public Affairs Officer here at NASA Johnson Space Center. So, I'm nearing about eight months, and I specifically work with our, you know, Flight Operations Directorate, which includes our astronauts, and work with our social media manager for a lot of the social media efforts. But for the podcast specifically, I think the best way to describe my role on the podcast starts with me just inserting myself, and just showing up to the meetings. And so, I can't thank you all enough for accepting me and allowing me to help with contributions like guest coordination and social media efforts with Norah. And it's been a lot of fun because I'm also learning along the way and getting to know a lot of different people across the agency, with all the different people that we get to talk to, and a lot of the behind the scenes that we have the opportunity to be a part of. So, it's been a load of fun. So, thank you very much for allowing me to join you all.  Host: Jennifer, it's been fantastic to have you as well. I think, you know, you talk about you're freshly minted and being able to see, you know, all the different parts of the agency, but I think -- what I really value about your contribution, is your fresh perspective. And I just said, we've been doing this for three years, and maybe that doesn't sound like a lot, but I feel like you know, you can somehow get trapped in like a routine of doing things a certain way. So, keeping us fresh and making sure we're constantly thinking about new ideas on how to approach things, has been really refreshing. So, Jennifer it's been fantastic to have you.  Jennifer Hernandez: Thanks, Gary.  Host: Dan Huot, another OG, kicking us off with Episode 1. Glad you can actually join us. We've been missing you for this past year. Haven't heard your voice hosting in quite a while, but I'm glad that you can join us and take part in celebrating this -- another year of, Houston We Have a Podcast. Dan Huot.  Dan Huot: Thanks, Gary. And always fun to be here. I miss filling in every once in a while, but Gary and Pat have it so well covered, I've been off doing other things. So, kind of an interloper this year, but always happy to jump on and be your guys' cheerleader. And I'm wondering what flavor cake everybody made for themselves at 10 a.m.  Host: I'll be honest—[Laughter]  Pat Ryan: You don't want to know.  Host: Yes. Well Dan, it's -- thanks for helping to kick us off. I know -- I do mean it when I say that you know, I think we all miss having you host, and we'll have to look forward to having you on a little bit more. But I know, you know, besides you being part of the podcast, you did have a lot to do with the Demo-2 mission. Just an incredible amount of work and it definitely paid off. So, I'm glad to even have you be a small part of this team. And I know you work a lot with commercial crew and anything human spaceflight, you know, the International Space Station and so forth. And that's really, you know, I consider you the team leader. You are the team leader, and that's my job here. I'm Gary Jordan, and I'm a Public Affairs Officer as well, under Dan's team, focusing mostly on Commercial Crew these days, but also the podcast host and really helping to kick this thing off and continue it going. And I absolutely love, love doing it every single week. And so, I will continue -- I will continue to talk to great people for my own selfish reasons. I love sitting down and trapping people for an hour, just to pelt them with questions, because I'm super interested in all of this. So, it's been a pleasure to be doing this. I want to kick off this year of reminiscing. You know, we're in July 2020 by the time this thing actually comes out. And we have had a lot of content, but actually if you take it back a whole year, the first episode that we did after our last anniversary, was Episode 100. That's crazy to think about that we skipped -- started off the year with 100 -- the 100 Episode celebration. I got to sit down with the administrator who has said very nice things about the podcast, and it was a pleasure to have him on again actually. We did have him on beforehand, but it was really -- it was really fun having him on to kick us off.  Jim Bridenstine: And this was a contest of political ideologies. It was a contest of economic ideologies. It was a contest of technological prowess, and in this great contest of great powers, the United States of America was determined to win. And the objective was to get to the Moon. Interestingly, we were able to achieve that victory, July 20th, 1969 with Neil Armstrong, Buzz Aldrin, and of course 400,000 people that were working on the program at the time. And when we achieved it, we moved into a new era where we in fact now partner with Russia.  Host: Now, of course Dan, I know Episode 1 always seems to be at the top of the list for the number of downloads. I think it was last year, we actually said that Stan Love's episode, “Mars is Hard” had more downloads than Episode 1, overtaking it for Year two. I'm proud to say Year three, we do have a new top episode, and that is Episode 101 with our podcast guest extraordinaire, Jennifer Ross-Nazzal, who has been on a few times. [Applause] Yes, well-deserved round of applause. She contributed so much to the podcast. But Jennifer came on for this episode to talk about the lesser known stories of Apollo 11. And it was a unique episode because she did a lot of the work and research herself. She was the historian bringing on some of these great stories.  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: You know, a lot of people you probably hear a lot of conspiracy stories about how -- of course, we didn't really go to the Moon. A lot of people say, \"Well, one reason is because if you look at that flag that's on the Moon, it looks like it's fluttering in the wind.\" Well, Jack Kinzler had come up with this idea because of course, they wanted you to be able to see the flag. So, they actually stitched a hem on this flag, and they had an aluminum rod that would go through. You were actually supposed to completely stretch it out so it'd be completely straight for the photos, but the crew noticed that it would -- it was kind of fluttering. You know, the way it might flutter here on Earth? And so, they didn't extend that aluminum rod that whole way. They decided to leave it where it looked like it was fluttering.  Host: Oh.  Jennifer Ross-Nazzal: And so, to this day, a lot of people say, \"Well, of course it's on a sound stage somewhere in Burbank,\" or what have you. And but, he had designed it that way.  Host: Yes, so that was the number one listened to episode of the past year. Still is, I believe. So, I guess we'll have to come up with an even cooler idea for Year four here, guys. So, get those wheels turning. So, this one didn't exactly make it as the top contender, but I will say this one had the most social media engagement on the episode that I've in a long time, Episode 104, with Jason Hutt. This was an episode where Jason Hutt, he's -- I applaud this guy's brain because he thinks of every emergency scenario that could happen on a deep space mission, and he's thinking about how to mitigate some of those risks with backup computers, with fire suppression, with all of these different techniques. So, he's the one that's thinking of all these different ways to save the crew, save the mission, through all of these different emergency scenarios, going deep down the rabbit hole, and it was just fascinating to be talking to him.  Host: It has to get through these several layers of defense first.  Jason Hutt: Right.   Host: It's got to be you know, the design of the equipment itself, the nitrogen flowing over it.  Jason Hutt: Right.  Host: It's -- there's a lower probability of catching fire in the first place, but what if it does? That's where you're at right now.  Jason Hutt: And we've tested those computers to show -- and shown that if a fire does start in that computer, it usually burns itself out. So again, it would have to be -- something else would have to catch on fire with it, in order for that fire to propagate and get worse in the cabin.  Host: A low probability of something --  Jason Hutt: Right.  Host: -- getting to that point, which is why your -- that's your risk.  Jason Hutt: Right, as opposed to a fire in the open cabin --  Host: Right.  Jason Hutt: -- where you have clothes for the crew members, maybe you have a paper from something that they're working on. There's more fuel that could be consumed in a fire in the open cabin than there is behind some of these base.  Host: OK. And obviously, you know a lot of teams working on this, assessing this, and figuring out that, \"Yes, there is a risk of that, but it's so low that we can feel comfortable designing it in this fashion.\"  Jason Hutt: Right.  Host: OK.  Jason Hutt: But we still have the capability to respond in some form or fashion.  Host: Yes.  Jason Hutt: We can't have the hubris of saying, \"This will never happen.\"  Host: Never happen, right.  Jason Hutt: Right.  Host: Of course, Year three had a lot of returns of guests to the podcast. We already mentioned Jennifer Ross-Nazzal, but we also had the return of Nujoud Merancy who some may recognize as one of our earlier podcast guests. She talked about Orion, the very base episode of Orion. The episode title was just Orion. But she's since moved on to bigger and better things, working with Mission Planning, and was actually able to draw really good comparisons of the Artemis Mission architecture, and the Apollo Mission architecture. It was absolutely fascinating because I think a lot of people have this confusion of, \"What is Artemis doing, versus what Apollo is doing?\" You know, and there was -- she really broke it down in a super-understandable way.  Host: So, this mission profile, the mission profile of Apollo, what was good about it, to meet the needs of the time?  Nujoud Merancy: What was good about it, is by putting it all on one launch, while you limited where you could go on the surface of the Moon, it was one launch. So, that way, you had the least amount of resources assigned to it, the least amount of risk, even though there's a lot of risk still, you only had one launch to get it up there. But as a result, you were very limited on how long you could stay, and how much you could take, which was only three people for a limited stay of a couple days.  Host: So, why won't this mission profile work for what we want to do with Artemis?  Nujoud Merancy: So, one of the big differences between Apollo, which was get to the Moon, as fast as you can, as quick as you can, it is -- for Artemis, we want to be sustainable, which means we want to be able to explore for longer durations. Potentially, you could build bases. But also, you want to demonstrate things you need to go Mars. And all of the things you need to go to Mars involve much longer durations. Surface stays on Mars are basically 30 days to 6 months. So, you need to be able to do long duration stays, and have long-term build-up of stuff, because you need a lot more stuff, the longer you're going to stay. So, it's a very different goal between Apollo and Artemis.  Host: And complicated. Now, when you stay longer and you need more stuff, that's all more complicated stuff.  Host: Now, of course, Pat, I skipped a few steps here. I want to circle back to you because I was just going through some of my favorite episodes, but I did want to take it back to Episode 102. This was one of my favorite episodes, for sure, because usually you know, we only take a few guests and we have them for an hour, but this was a montage of some of the most important people, the biggest leaders here at NASA, to talk about how Apollo 11 influenced them and a little bit about how they view human spaceflight. It was a really good episode, Pat.  Pat Ryan: Well, thanks. At the time, last July when we were all focused on the 50th Anniversary of Apollo 11, I thought that it might be -- looking for a little different angle that we talked to the leaders of NASA's current human spaceflight programs, and the offices here at the Johnson Space Center, the Home of Human Spaceflight in America, to get their ideas on what we called, \"the next first steps.\" The programs that NASA is working on now, that are aimed at putting Americans back on the Moon, so that we can learn how to put some other astronauts on Mars someday. We talked to leaders from Headquarters and from JSC center leadership, program leadership, to hear their personal memories of Apollo 11. Now, most of them did have one, and they had some unusual stories. But also, how they were influenced, directly or indirectly in their future careers. That was Episode 102. Take a listen. For all of that, I particularly -- particularly I think for their thoughts on the value of putting the human in human spaceflight, and why it matters that we put people on top of rockets, so that we can explore off the planet. I put together a short clip here. First featuring Johnson Space Center Director, Mark Geyer, and then Steve Koerner, the Chief of the Flight Operations Directorate here at JSC. They're talking about the unlikely intersection of practicality and destiny.  Mark Geyer: The human mind is an incredible machine, and we -- the mind is capable of learning and adapting, so much more than any computer that we may ever develop. And we saw in Apollo that when we sent those scientists to the surface, their ability to learn and adapt and enhance what we were trying to do, it just multiplied our capability, so much more. You know, the rovers one Mars are incredible machines, but even then, they're limited. So, that's number one. Number two, I think it is, you know, I believe that the -- that our destiny as a species is not limited to Earth. That we will go out into the solar system and so to me, this is the beginning of that destiny.  Steve Koerner: Asking the first folks that sailed the seas, \"Why's it important?\" Or asking the first folks that flew, \"Why is it important?\" You look back and now it seems common-place that of course it was important, but I don't know that they started off with all those answers, but that inquisitive human nature of, \"This is something that ought to be pursued.\" So, that's kind of one, almost general level. I'm not sure what the right word there is, but for me, more personally, it's the opportunity to influence in a way that's significant. Human spaceflight. I mean, I can't think of a better time to spend -- a better way to spend my time for myself personally, challenging me, but also contributing to my kids, my family. Human spaceflight is an impressive, grand, bold effort that to me is absolutely worth it from, again, a personal perspective. In anything I do, I look for three things. I want to have fun. I want to provide value. And I want to learn something. And I challenge somebody to point out something other than human spaceflight that could more maximize those three things.  Pat Ryan: So, I had a lot of fun, talking to all these people who are running today's human spaceflight programs, and seeing them on a personal level, but learning things I didn't know about their backgrounds, and why they do what they do here.  Host: That was a really good episode, and you know, all of the things you just said, why they do what they do, but also you know, this was a really important year for this anniversary, especially the Apollo 11 anniversary, but we really investigated a lot of Moon episodes. Pat, I know you spearheaded a few of them with author Andy Chaikin, and we got -- I guess a resident Moon expert, Sam Lawrence in here. All these great episodes, really diving deep into the Moon.  Pat Ryan: It was an unplanned conjunction, really. But we aired back to back weeks in October of Episodes 113 and 114. It was first, our friend Gordon Andrews called up and said, \"Hey, do you want to interview Andrew Chaikin?\" We said, \"Yes, where? When?\" He's a long-time space journalist and big NASA cheerleader. And this came just after the Apollo 11 and in public affairs, of course we were talking a lot about the Artemis program, and about the new effort to return astronauts to the Moon. Chaikin is so conversant in Apollo history, and he can make the historical connection from what happened then, to what we're doing now. He also told a story about the value and the importance of having human beings involved in space exploration. He talked about this lesson he learned after his mother suggested to him, that he write about the people who were involved in Apollo. And that led him to interviewing, all but one of the Apollo astronauts.  Andrew Chaikin: What I brought to bear on Man on the Moon was a sensitivity to the human experience, and a sense of how to put myself in their place from what they were telling me in these interviews. That I could then be a storyteller, and make that experience come alive on the page.  Pat Ryan: You undoubtedly, you would agree that the reason people get more excited about lunar exploration with astronauts, as opposed to unmanned--  Andrew Chaikin: Sure.  Pat Ryan: -- probes, is the manned part. It --  Andrew Chaikin: Exactly.  Pat Ryan: -- puts everybody else in that spot.  Andrew Chaikin: You know what the perfect example of that is? You know, Apollo 8 was the first human beings, Frank Borman, Jim Lovell, Bill Anders, they were the first human beings to leave the Earth and visit another world. They didn't land, of course. They circled the Moon, but they were the first to experience the site of the lunar far side with human eyes. They were the first to see the Earth from lunar distance. The famous Earth-rise picture that Bill Anders took, became a touchstone for the latter half of the 20th Century. But three years before, two years before that, lunar orbiter, one of the lunar orbiter probes, had circled the Moon and taken an Earth-rise picture, and at the time, it was a big deal. It was a headline, but nothing compares to the sound of a human voice coming to us from a place where no one has ever been. And nothing compares to having those people come back and tell us, in their own words, what that was like.  Pat Ryan: What it was like.  Andrew Chaikin: Yes. You can't do that with a robot. Neil Armstrong once said, \"A robot -- a human can be amused and amazed, and a robot can do neither.\" So, you know, there -- we have this innate desire in us. We all start out as explorers, right? When we're learning to crawl, and we crawl from one room into another, that's our moonwalk.  Pat Ryan: But we're exploring our environment.  Andrew Chaikin: We're exploring. We are driven to do that. It's in our DNA. And so, we want to go. We want to be -- we want to have the experience of seeing what no one's ever seen, of knowing what no one's ever known. And I personally have been driven by that feeling since I was five years old and I still have that inside me, that I want to go into space, and then come back and tell about it. I don't know if I'll ever get that chance, but that is what has driven me my whole life.  Pat Ryan: And Chaikin also talked a lot about the scientific importance of research on the Moon, but we got a lot more of that from the guest the following week. Sam Lawrence is his name. He's a planetary scientist, in the Astro Materials Research and Exploration Science Division at JSC. What that means is, he's the lead lunar exploration scientist, very involved in actually developing the scientific objectives of the Artemis project. Lawrence actually calls himself, \"The Cheerleader in Chief for the Moon.\" Among the cool things I learned about the Moon that day, things which frankly I don't remember having learned when I was a student for many reasons, but it was Lawrence's explanation of how the Moon is responsible for us knowing how old all the planets are. He gives the credit for that to the human beings who went to the Moon with picks and shovels.  Samuel Lawrence: The biggest reason why I say that the Moon is the Rosetta Stone of the solar system is we landed, with astronauts, who did field work in key locations on the lunar surface. From that field work, they picked up samples, they did geology in the field, they selected, carefully selected samples, more carefully in some cases than others, but they selected samples that were tied back to specific locations on the lunar surface. And from that, we brought it back here to Houston, and then distributed those samples all over the world, and did radiometric age dating, and figured out how old those samples were. And very similarly to, you know, when you cut down a tree, you count the number of rings?  Pat Ryan: Right.  Samuel Lawrence: And that tells you how old the tree is. Well, on another planet, especially ones that don't have atmospheres, it is the number of craters that tells you -- that can be used to infer how old the surface is. The more craters there are, the older the surface is.  Pat Ryan: The longer it's been there exposed to passing asteroids.  Samuel Lawrence: That's right. That's right. And so, it's you know, there are always exceptions to every rule, and that's sort of a gross oversimplification of it, but in general, that rule holds. The older the surface, the more craters there are. So, what you could do is, you could count the areas near the Apollo landing site, see how many craters are on those areas, and then figure out, because we have samples, the radiometric age dates, you know, see how old they were. And then that timescale has actually been extended to every, single one of the inner terrestrial planets. Mercury, Mars, Vesta, and it really is this gift that has kept on giving. You know, you can make a pretty good case, in a sense, it is actually what happened, that most of the discoveries we've made in planetary science over the past five decades, are directly or indirectly related to the discoveries made by the Apollo astronauts on the surface of the Moon.  Pat Ryan: And of course, that includes the next to last man on the Moon, Astronaut Jack Schmitt who, Gary, you talked to for Episode 121 that we posted last December. Sam Lawrence has a really easy to understand explanation for why sending astronauts back to the Moon is a good idea, and about how things we believe are there, can help us succeed in our goal of creating that sustainable presence on the Moon, that we need in order to help us get to Mars.  Host: And this was such an important year for just thinking about the Moon and looking forward to Mars. It was a year of anniversaries, too. Not just the one, but we all -- you know, like you said Pat, I did get to talk with Jack Schmitt. This was, actually for a lot of the Apollo 11 stuff, but I really got to ask him a lot of questions about Apollo 17, which is years down the road, but you know, I wanted to make sure that people got to hear his voice, especially now. Thinking about Artemis, where we are with some of the current programs and milestones, even 47 years instead of 50, after his mission. But I think, you know, along the lines of anniversaries, I loved Apollo 13. I'm so happy that we actually got to have them here in the studio, 50 years later to remember such a milestone mission. Of course, Lovell was on the phone, but Fred Haise we got to have in the studio. He came very early. Belinda, I remember you were there, and we got to -- we got to sit down with Fred Haise and just have some back and forth chit-chat, just about -- for about an hour, just about different things about life, and it was really great to have him. Belinda, I don't know if you -- I know that was kind of cool to have him there.  Belinda Pulido: Yes. I had actually met him as an intern, but to meet him again at the podcast, that episode, Apollo 13, was amazing. He's a great person as well. So, it was a great -- it was definitely a highlight for me, for being part of the podcast.  Fred Haise: Well, I mean, we heard the bang and you know, it rang through this metallic structure. We're in metal vehicles. And of course, the first thing is, \"What was it? What was it?\" And at the time, I got to the left of the lunar module where I was putting away equipment, we head out to do a show and tell TV show. I was still putting things away. By the time I drifted up to my position in the right couch which had a lot of the cryogenics and the fuel cells and all of that, I looked and saw one oxygen -- two oxygen instruments on Tank 2 in the bottoms, both pressure and quantity. And I knew we had lost one oxygen tank almost for sure, because those two different kinds of sensors that would feed those dials. And so, I knew we had lost a tank, and I knew we had -- that would constitute an abort. I was sick to my stomach with disappointment because I knew pretty quick, we had an aborted mission and we weren't going to get to land on the Moon.  Host: And of course, I think another thing about this year is we really dove right into a lot of different series. I think there's a few that definitely stick out as my favorite. Of course, the series on the Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer. We did that because they were doing some really important work to basically restore the AMSs cooling components to its full capability to continue the experiment and have it keep collecting some amazing particles. But we had a series on the Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer, diving deep into the science and the spacewalks. And Pat, I know you got to talk with a lot of different tool developers on just the intricate details. We got real nerdy with this. Definitely one of my favorite episodes.  Pat Ryan: Yes, they -- these are the people who are responsible for managing the team that actually had to develop some brand-new tools to do this work on the spacewalk. Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer was not designed to have this sort of surgery performed on it in space. So, they had to figure out how to do it without damaging the instrument. And they had to develop some absolutely completely brand-new tools. They even talked about one of them that was -- that -- help that they were getting from some college students. They ran a program. There's a program that runs all the time to help the college students, engineering students, learn about things. And they had some help from college students on how to save that instrument.  Host: Now that was one of the many series we had. We had a few more. Of course, it was the return of HRP, for those long-time listeners. We did a series with them, I believe -- we'll call it Season 1, but it was our first year. We had the Five Hazards of Human Spaceflight. We had the return of some of those fantastic guests. I know Tom Williams is one that sticks out, just because I had a fascinating conversation with him about isolation back in the Five Hazards, but we got to have him again for another series, the Human Research Program. Jen Fogarty helped us to kick it off, and man, what a fascinating person Jen is, just -- I didn't really need to ask her a ton of questions because she just started going deep into how the human body works in space. And I honestly, I told her afterwards I said, \"Jen, you're one of those few people I think that I can have on the podcast for three hours, and it could be just a fascinating conversation.\"  Jennifer Fogarty: So, when you are working full-time, eating and exercising take a backseat, just like in your everyday life. So, we started seeing people lose weight, and their body composition changed a little bit, even in a two-week period, and we could measure it. And that's really when we started discovering things like the orthostatic intolerance, because we had a lot more people flying. We had men and women flying. And they were dedicated toward operations. And so, the human need kind of took a little bit of a backseat. So, that led to a lot of understanding about what we were capable of doing, depending on how you designed the operations of the mission. In 2000, when they launched Space Station, the idea was these people were going up, and going up for longer durations. At the time, it was probably more like four months, three, four months. Not quite the six months and more that we're doing now. But that's a marathon, compared to shuttle. And so, you really had to understand where were we going with expectations on the human, and were we providing what the human needed over time to still be healthy and functional, perform well, given that they had a mission to do?  Host: And the next one, I don't think it really was meant to be a series, but it turned out to be. I got lucky enough to bring on Dr. Gary Kitmacher, onto the show. A person with a ton of history here at NASA, but just a history buff himself, he knows the space station, inside and out. And so, we took it all the way back, investigating the history of space stations. I think we actually meant for it to just be kind of a one-time thing. But by the time we were done with our hour, we hadn't even gotten to the International Space Station. And so, I said, \"Gary, if you're willing to come back for another round of this, we can dive deep into the space station.\" And he was more than happy to do so. We got two episodes out of it, and it was really, really fun.  Gary Kitmacher: Computers, when we started the design of computers for the space station in the 1980s, there was not such thing as a laptop computer. The first small Apples, Apple computers were coming out probably around '87 or thereabouts. I remember when I went off to the source board because I was the scribe, I was the person writing a lot of these documents, they repackaged one of these Apple computers. It wasn't by any means a portable. We called it a \"luggable.\" And but, we were looking at large, refrigerator-sized racks full of computer equipment in the 1980s. By the time of Mir, when our first astronaut went up to the Mir, he said he really could have used some kind of a computer system to read documents on, read training manuals, because otherwise, we had no way of sending up lots of different manuals. Even during his off hours, he said, \"Boy, I could use something just to watch a movie on.\" And so, I was given the job to develop the first portable computer, to be used as a training aid and also to be able to be used in off-duty hours. I remember we recorded onto small, 8-millimeter cassettes, the Apollo 13 movie, among others.  Host: Oh.  Gary Kitmacher: And sent those up in 1995.  Host: Now, Jennifer, a little bit later episode 136, this was -- kind of came out of nowhere, but we -- it was kind of tied to the astronaut application which opened up, I think it was only for a month. I think it was through the month of March. But we got to sit down with Anne Roemer and Kayla Barron and go in front of the cameras for a special video episode of the podcast, and that had to be one of my favorites, Jennifer, because we incorporated social media into it. And Kayla was telling some of the -- some awesome stories that I'd never heard before from astronaut training. It was just a really good time.  Jennifer Hernandez: Gary, it certainly was, especially because being new to you know, the podcast team, and having that opportunity to really have this interactive conversation, you know, with these individuals, it was really neat to see how, you know, kind of our audience and our listeners, and maybe new listeners, you know, really engaged with us in order to have that real-time conversation, and answering those questions that they submitted on social media. And it was just really neat to have that banter, amongst these individuals, including yourself, and having that be a part of just the overall, you know, kind of lent itself to the treatment of the overall conversation. I thought it was so neat, and I was really happy to be a part of that. I think it definitely gave the conversation a different flavor.  Kayla Barron: Hopefully Johnny would think it's OK for me to tell this story, but one of my favorite moments from that trip, we -- so, there's not much water in that part of Utah. A lot of times, your kind of scooping it out of these little potholes in the rock, just like an inch thick of water, trying to fill your, you know, various vessels for the day. So, it was kind of hard to get water sometimes. But one night, it started just this torrential downpour of rain. And it was cold, and we're all huddled sort of under this overhang, trying to stay dry. And Johnny's tromping around in the puddles. He's wearing this big, camouflage poncho, and I just remember looking up at him and my headlamp was shining on him. It was dark. And he was using his poncho as a funnel to shoot rainwater into all the water bottles, and pots and pans. And he just looked up at me with this really excited look on this face and said, \"Kayla, look at all this free water.\" And it made me laugh so hard because it's just like -- it's in those moments where people are cold and tired and, you know, maybe a little bit bummed out, and seeing one of your peers, your teammates, like literally the glass is half full for him. You know, he's just like, \"Look at all this free water.\" And you're like -- you can think it's cold, terrible rain, but for him, he was choosing to see it from a different perspective. And that's the kind of teammate you really want in those hard moments, because all of a sudden everyone's laughing, everyone's morale is boosted, and that's just Johnny being Johnny. You know, Johnny being himself and being willing to share himself with us really brought the team out of you know, a tough moment.  Host: I really hope we get to do that more, because I think that was -- the intent was we were really hoping to kick off a series of video episodes, and maybe when we're back from quarantine, that maybe we can start investigating some of those down the road and do a couple more video things. But I think that was one of the last episodes we recorded with -- in studio, I guess, even though it was in front of the camera. There were -- actually, I think the last interviews we did, and Alex, you're going to be very proud of me for bringing this us, was the Soyuz landing episode. Man, I've been holding onto this one for a while. I know, you know, we meet weekly to talk about some of the episodes, and this one has been on the list, but it's just -- it took a lot of work to put together. So, some of those interviews that you heard for Soyuz landing, was happening in the days before we actually went to a work from home status for NASA. And man, I'm lucky we got to bring those in. Alex, I hope you're proud of me for actually pulling through and getting that one out.  Alex Perryman: I definitely am. You know what? As long as a wait it was, it was definitely worth the wait. I think that episode was really, really awesome. And hearing the sounds and the way the flow of it, and that for me that was one of the -- the first episode I had to edit straight from home. So, that was a big transition for me, and to start working from home on an episode as complicated as that one was definitely challenging. But I think the overall result came out really great. [Background music] Host: Our pilot brings us fairly close to the capsule. A short walk, but far enough away so as not to affect the operations going on. Turns out, we're one of the first helos to get there. Some teams are preparing structures to retrieve the crew inside. It's my job to report all of that. I call in to NASA TV, which has been broadcasting the crew's departure and landing live, and report what I'm seeing.   [NASA TV Report]: Well Rob, it is a very brisk winter out here, there is a bit of overcast out here at the landing site, so we weren’t able to see the capsule come down, but here I am right in front of it, capsule erected perfectly -- [Background music] Host: Sometimes, there is a Russian video crew out at the site, but they haven't made it there yet. So, my reports of the capsule status, safe and upright, are the first to most. Eventually, a crowd surrounds the capsule. Logistics professionals, medical doctors, program leads, all eagerly awaiting to see the crew who have been living in space for six months.  Shannan Moynihan: And so, the search and rescue folks will go and they're saving the capsule, making sure everything looks good. We're there at that point in time, so we're watching what is going on. I've been able to go over and kind of look through the window, get an eyeball on my crew, make sure that they look like they're doing well, get the thumbs up.  Host: Yes, and that was -- I really, really enjoyed doing that one. I'm glad we got it out. It was a different style. It was a narrative style. But I just -- I like playing with different stuff. Jennifer, we did the [video episode. That was kind of] different. The Soyuz landing was a completely different narrative style. Just to try to explore different ways of doing things. Jennifer, actually thinking about just you know, some of our favorite episodes and doing things a little bit differently, not necessarily differently but actually one of my favorites was “The Untouched Apollo Samples.” This was kind of a timely episode because we got to bring Charis Krysher and Andrea Mosie, into the studio very shortly after they opened a sample that's been preserved for 47 years since Apollo 17. And I loved their story of when they finally got to the moment of opening it.  Charis Krysher: So, we actually created and mixed together these different materials, different sand, different grain sizes, and extruded that to get a feel for what the actual extrusion would be like, and the dissection, so we could practice that. And then --  Andrea Mosie: We did that several times.  Charis Krysher:  Yes, we did that several times.  Host: You're basically becoming a process -- like an expert.  Andrea Mosie: Yes.  Charis Krysher: Yes.  Host: Techniques down. You're limiting what is unpredictable. You're trying to think about what you know, this is exactly -- to a certain extent, this is exactly what I'm going to expect whenever I actually open this thing.  Charis Krysher: Yes.  Andrea Mosie: Yes.  Host: And these are the techniques I'm going to use.  Charis Krysher: Yes.  Andrea Mosie: And try to anticipate what was done in the future, and what we needed to change for --  Charis Krysher: Yes.  Andrea Mosie: -- the present, because a few things changed.  Charis Krysher: Yes.  Andrea Mosie: We did change some -- made some modifications.  Charis Krysher: We did. We did. We decided to put everything together outside of the box that we could ahead of time, instead of trying to handle these tiny, little screws inside of a glove box, with your hands in the gloves.  Andrea Mosie: Really tedious.  Charis Krysher: Yes. So, but then, when we got to the moment, I mean that was, woo.  Andrea Mosie: Yes.  Charis Krysher: That was -- yes. That was a -- you know, got a little warm there. Got a little sweaty. Yes. That was incredible. And to, you know, I've got the core in front of me and the first thing that you have to do is you have to take off -- it's capped on both ends. So, you have to take off one end, and then you pivot the core tube around, and then you take off the other end.  Host: This is all in the glove box that you're doing this?  Charis Krysher: In the glove box.  Andrea Mosie: Yes.  Host: And it's your hands?  Charis Krysher: It's my hands and it's facing me, and nobody else can see what's going on. And then to actually take off that cap.  Andrea Mosie: Yes.  Charis Krysher: That cap that the last person who handled it, was Gene Cernan --  Andrea Mosie: Yes.  Charis Krysher: -- on the Moon, in 1972. Nobody else had touched it. That was my moment. That was -- that was the moment I had to stop and do a little heavy -- you know, deep breathing.  Andrea Mosie:  I was documenting everything, and I would type, \"Charis is having a moment.\" [Laughter]  Charis Krysher: I think I stopped. I said, \"Wait, I'm having a moment.\" And that's -- she did. She wrote that down on our documentation --  Host: Wow.  Charis Krysher: “Charis is having a moment.”  Jennifer Hernandez: It was also incredible for that episode, Gary, because not only was their dynamic really fun and how they, you know, conversed amongst each other and then with, you know, with you, but I think another thing was that they both had very, and I've learned this with a lot of our guests on the podcast is that their story about how they got to where they are, was -- is incredible. And Andrea has been with, you know, with the agency for quite a while. So, to be able to add that history to it, and to be a part of you know, an opening, was just incredible. And as somebody who just you know, being from the other side there for a little bit, before I joined NASA, right, and then being at NASA and be like, \"That's awesome. You were the people that did that.\" You know? Because -- and it's really neat and they're just so passionate about what they do, and I love their non, you know, linear, you know, paths to where they are. And I think that was incredible that they shared that with us, in that episode as well.  Host: One of my absolute favorites, yes so, that was another one we got to record right before we all went from work from home. Alex, I know you mentioned it's been difficult working from home with Coronavirus. You have to do things a little bit differently, you know? I guess you're spoiled when it comes to some of the tech you have here at NASA.  Alex Perryman: Yes, just some of the tech that we have at NASA, it mainly was a mental thing. Just trying to -- when I'm at work on-site, it's easy for me to be able to sit down and work on a mix. When I'm at home, I don't have a quiet, or my dog wants attention all the time. He's barking while I'm trying to mix. I'm trying to make my setup as similar to NASA's setup, without using the same technology. So, it was a little difficult at first, but I got it down now as well as I can to be able to push out episodes as quick as I was before. But it was definitely a bit of a challenge. Mainly of it was a mental thing. Having to figure out a quiet space. Trying to actually make myself focus working at home, was kind of challenging. And background noise. The lawn guy always coming by at 8 o'clock in the morning, right when I want to start working on a mix. He comes by and just starts standing in front of my window, blowing his leaf blower and just texting on his phone. So, getting through all of that and still kind of putting out episodes at the quality that we're used to putting out, was definitely challenging.  Host: There's been so many times we haven't been able to get our favorite room, which is Studio A. We have to record there. I know we are recording from the booth for some of the remote episodes, even recording from home now for this episode. We've had a wild number of locations for recording this episode. I know one of my favorites, we had to record you know, in a different configuration with quarantine and with social distancing, was actually for Demo-2, we really needed to talk with the crew and we really wanted to put together something that kind of explained the mission forward to backwards, I was lucky enough to get, not only the crew for a certain segment in the beginning, but I got Zeb Scoville, the Flight Director here in Mission Control Houston, to come in and man, what a passionate and knowledgeable guy. I got to -- he actually gave me a little bit more time than we originally had. We got an hour and a half with him, and I asked him every question I could about the mission, and he was just more than happy to share. But the passion he had was just unbelievable.  Zeb Scoville: You know, if we've done our job well, then what people will see is a mission that looks easy. And in many cases, you know, I've seen this throughout my career in spaceflight, nothing about it is easy. But if we do it right, it looks easy. And so that's what I'm hoping people are able to see, but just know that there are people that have -- that spend a lot of time and effort and it is their life's honor to be able to do so, and to be able to inspire, you know, whether it's you know the kids or the grandparents, on what we can do when we come together and put our differences aside, and whether you're a new company or an old agency, or you know, you're you know, fresh out of college, or someone who has decades of spaceflight experience with you, you know, everyone's got something they can add. You know, you don't have to be a mechanical engineer. You know, whether it's you know, teachers or scientists.  Host: Now, I know we're I guess close to 150 at this point. What was that? Demo-2 was Episode 145. This is Episode 152. I know one of the later ones, Norah, was the NASA Photographers episode, kind of explaining about, a little bit of what you do in your everyday life when you're not helping us with the podcast.  Norah Moran: Yes, that was a fun podcast, I thought, because it was -- the guys that I work with on a daily basis there that you interviewed. And if you listen to that podcast and you hear the clicks, that's my camera. I was there taking pictures, which you know, is very on brand, I guess. And one thing I did want to say about that podcast is it was fun to listen to that about experiences. And one of the things that Josh talked about was his first time at the [Neutral Buoyancy Laboratory] NBL, which was also my first time at the NBL. That was when James and I -- James brought Josh and I to the NBL. We were both new employees, and he was showing us around. And there was a shoot out there, and it's funny because right now, I literally rushed home for this podcast, from a shoot at the NBL. So, it's really funny to compare those experiences. You know, the first time you're at the NBL is this really wild thing. It's like you get to watch these astronauts get suited up and go into this pool with this full-scale ISS. And it's just -- the first time you're there, it feels so surreal. And it, you know, you want to keep having -- Josh talks about how you want to keep having that energy every time you go, even though you go a lot. It can start to feel mundane, but it's still this really cool thing. And when you're capturing images of it, you want to bring that energy of excitement to the shoot every time. And I just thought that was a really cool thing that Josh talked about in that podcast.  Josh Valcarcel: And I remember the first time I went to the NBL, James took me there. And it was an astronaut getting suited up and I remember just getting so excited. And I still get excited when I go over there. But I was just taking a ton of pictures, and you know, James, I can't even imagine how many times you've shot this. But I'd come out of there. You know, we'd leave, we'd go back to the office, and I'm telling everybody, it's like, \"They're making history over there.\" You know, it was just like I was so jazzed by it. And it's just really important to like not lose sight of that.  Host: I loved having those guys on, and honestly, that was one of my favorites to have. It was a little bit different because we don't normally have three guests, but I know all those guys, you know? We work together all the time and I see them at shoots and mission control and various events that are happening. They're just everywhere. I think NASA photographer is just one of the coolest job -- pretty jealous of what you do, Norah.  Norah Moran: It's definitely a cool job to have. I can't argue with you there.  Host: What I love about doing this podcast is we can come up with unique things. You know, we can have an episode on NASA photographers, and dive into this thing that maybe isn't talked about in normal content, you know? We're always talking about, especially nowadays, we're talking about the Moon and Mars. We're talking a lot about mission control and Commercial Crew. These are just topics that are pretty normal but diving into stuff like that is always so fun. I think another popular episode we had was “Mission Patches” with Sean Collins, one of the great designers of some of those patches. And just one of those unique things that you know, you don't really hear from these guys very often. And so, a lot of people wonder about, you know, \"Where do these mission patches come from? Who's the person designing them?\" So, it's really cool to have people like them on. And then of course, with being part of this team and coming up with some of those ideas, of unique topics, Belinda, I know you suggested “Space Hygiene.” And I just -- I kick myself in the butt because I feel like, that was one we all should have come up with. One of the top questions that people ask is, you know, \"How do you pee in space?\" And I'll tell you, those -- that episode was one of my favorites to record because Elisca Hicks and Mike Berrill were so engaging, and so fun. We were laughing. We were -- it was a very relatable kind of conversation. And it was your idea, Belinda. It was one of my favorite episodes, truly.  Belinda Pulido: Thank you. Yes, I enjoyed that episode as well. Yes, Elisca and Mike, which they talk about how astronauts maintain their hygiene in space, and one thing that really stood out for me during the conversation was that, how they recycle today's coffee to the next day. And how they just laugh about it, but it's, you know, it's true. It's what happens in space. And they also recycle urine and sweat. They also touched base on how they helped train the astronauts in how they use the bathroom in space as well. And it's a bit crazy to think about it here from Earth, you know, in my opinion, but just learning about it is extremely exciting. And so, the whole conversation was just great. And I was so happy to have suggested the topic. And, yes. Definitely, a great, great podcast episode.  Elisca Hicks: What's the saying? Today's coffee is tomorrow's coffee, or something like that.  Mike Berrill: Yes. Yesterday's coffee is today's coffee. [Laughter]  Host: Absolutely one of my favorites. Thank you for suggesting that. Dan, we haven't heard from you in a while. I know you know, we absolutely missed having you on, but just taking a snapshot of everything we've talked about just now from Episode 100 all the way through just these past couple episodes that we've been doing, you know, just it's -- what are your thoughts? What are your -- you know, do you want to come on for a couple more episodes? What are you thinking?  Dan Huot: Yes. I definitely miss jumping in and the thing you love to see is, when we started it out, it was, \"OK, let's pick something kind of big and broad.\" And we just talked, \"What is the International Space Station?\" And to see the level of granularity and the level of specialization that we're now really just diving into, is insane. And it's really cool for us because part of our job is just know these things and this has honestly become one of those best tools, just to teach ourselves as we teach other people about all of the different systems, and all of the work that goes into just every day human spaceflight. And it's been really exciting to watch it all unfold and to bring people along for the ride, while also getting to do some of the more fun stuff, like going back in the anniversaries and things like that, that we don't always get to do. And this has been a really great platform for that.  Host: It really has. Alex, you've been with us since the beginning. What are your thoughts now? I mean, we're three years. Are you ready for another one?  Alex Perryman: I'm definitely ready for another one. I felt like over three years our podcasts has really like, not just grown in audience, but just grown in the way we handle and discuss content. And I think that I've learned extremely a lot. When I first started at the podcast, I was still kind of new at NASA. So, I didn't necessarily know a lot of the ins and outs of exactly what we do, and the different things that we're working on, and meeting the new -- the scientists and engineers. So, I've grown as a person, just listening to our podcast and being a part of it. So, I'm definitely excited to see what else we can come up with.  Host: Jennifer, as one of the newest members, thinking about the potential of what we could explore and what we could do, you know? Bringing your fresh ideas, is there a level of excitement there? Are you excited for the next year?  Jennifer Hernandez: Oh, absolutely. And I think you know, in a lot of ways, just getting started, I feel I think truly being with the podcast team, it's been like three, four months. Maybe a little longer, you know, in December. But then, you know, we started working from home and so, kind of learning at that aspect. So, I think you know, seeing the team overall and how we've come together to still kind of -- to continue the podcast, think out of the box, bring all these creative ideas, I mean what's not to be excited about for the next year? Right? And I think we are prepping ourselves for you know, a very awesome year, just like the ones that you've experienced and the growth and all that. It's going to be exciting. I'm pumped.  Host: I'm excited, too. I, you know, I love exploring, kind of like Dan said. Just the nitty gritty, those granular details, those stories that not a lot of people hear of. I just feel like there's no way we're going to be able to run out of content. I just feel like there's so much to explore with human spaceflight, and even more. I know just after this I think we're going to tackle some nonhuman spaceflight, which is tied to human spaceflight related topics. So, you know, we'll just -- we'll do whatever. And I'm happy to keep doing it, because I do see a certain amount of value in these. I know just coming up, I want to do more video episodes for sure. We have the 20th Anniversary of Continuous Human Presence on the Space Station. So, we'll continue to release episodes on that up until the 20th Anniversary in November of 2020. We have a collection of space station episodes, at our -- I guess at our episode webpage. There's a collection of space station episodes. And I guess to the listener, for those who have listened up to this point, thank you for listening to us and for subscribing and listening to our content. I hope you like it. Please leave a review, and any amount of stars, five through five, I believe is the range for our podcast. Leave some comments. Either -- whether you like it or not, just -- even to be critical. You know, we're always looking for ways to improve and provide suggestions. So, absolutely something I think we should do. Thank you to the listener for everything that you've done. Oh, we're on Teams now. And Jennifer, I see you are raising your hand. I'm going to toss it to you for a second.  Jennifer Hernandez: Right. You know, and on that note, I think you know, here we are like you know, kind of figuring out the stories, and you know, bringing that to light, but we would love our listeners to bring in suggestions, you know, using you know, hashtag #AskNASA, because there might be something we're not thinking of, or a question that we haven't answered yet, so far. And so, I think, you know, kind of on that note, Gary, it's awesome to have that engagement from our listeners, because we want to hear what you all want to hear about, too.  Host: Absolutely. Definitely want to hear what you all want -- I'm willing, you know, and we want to, and we have listened to your suggestions and made some improvements over time. So, definitely keep those coming. I want to end on this note. Having you guys all here, it's been an absolute honor to be working with every single one of you. I -- this is one of my favorite parts of the job is getting to do this, and I hope we will continue it. So, here's to another year guys. I promise when we can be within six feet of each other, we're going to have some cake. Alright, open mic clap everyone. Let's go out on a bang.
